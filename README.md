# InductiveDialogueGraph
Originally cloned from https://github.com/williamleif/GraphSAGE.git/ by the authors of "Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs" 2018 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216), this repo contains the code of a project using GraphsSAGE in order to perform inductive node classification as a graphical approach to dialogue act classification (DAC).
