m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK , good .
m e011 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] we don’t [ disfm arker] My underst anding of
what we [ pause] had agreed upon when we had spoken about t his
m ont hs ago was t hat , uh , we don’t act ually need a reply .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : That m akes it easy .
m e011 [ s^ e] : We just need t o t ell t hem t hat t hey can do it if t hey

m e013 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ df^ no] : I just didn’t rem em ber ,
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : And so no reply is no changes .
fe008 [ s] : And he ’s got it so t hat t he default t hing you see when you

.
m e011 [ fg] : Well [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah . The reason I did t hat it was just so t hat people
would not censor [ disfm arker] not ask t o have st uff rem oved because
it was t ranscribed incorrect ly ,
fe008 [ s.%−] : And t he reason I liked it was because [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.%−] : as opposed t o , uh [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : was because it , um [ disfm arker] it gives t hem t he opt ion of
, uh , being able t o correct it .

fe016 [ s.%−−] : I guess when I [ pause] read it , um [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s] : I ’m not as diligent as Chuck ,

fe016 [ s] : but I had t he feeling I should probably respond
fe016 [ s:s] : and t ell Adam , like , " I got t his and I will do it by t his dat e
,
fe016 [ s^ cs:s] : and if you don’t hear from m e by t hen [ disfm arker] "
You know , in ot her words responding t o y our em ail [ pause] once ,
right away , say ing " as soon as y ou get t his could you please respond

’ll need m ore t im e because t hey ’re out of t own or what ever , t hey can
t ell you at t hat point ?
fe016 [ %−] : Because [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ nd] : Oh , I just [ disfm arker] I didn’t wanna do t hat ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : because I don’t wanna have a discussion wit h every
person [ pause] if I can avoid it .
fe016 [ %−] : Well , it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ cs] : So what I want ed t o do was just send it out

m e011 [ s] : if y ou wanna do som et hing about it , do som et hing about

look at t his
m n017 [ s^ e] : and [ pause] m ake sure it ’s OK .
m n017 [ s^ df.%−] : Because if you [ disfm arker] if you , uh , do t his

uh , som e [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] you know , som eone who

m n017 [ s^ m ^ na] : That will happen .
m e011 [ s^ r] : That will absolut ely happen .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ df] : Because people don’t read t heir em ail ,
m e011 [ s:s] : or t hey ’ll read and say " I don’t care about t hat ,
m e011 [ s] : I ’m not gonna delet e anyt hing "
m e011 [ s] : and t hey don just won’t reply t o it .

m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ qw] : I m ean , what are we gonna doing here ?

m e013 [ %−] : Well .

m e013 [ s^ cc] : Let m e look at t his again .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : I [ disfm arker] I really don’t see t hat it ’s a problem .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat it ’s a com m on court esy t o ask

fe008 [ s] : I t hink t hey ’d appreciat e it .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah . My [ disfm arker] Adam , m y [ disfm arker] m y view
before was about [ pause] t he nat ure of what was [ disfm arker] of t he

m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ %−−] : of [ disfm arker] of how [ pause] m y [ disfm arker] m y
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qh.%−−] : t he t hings t hat we ’re quest ioning were along t he
lines of how easy [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ qh.%−−] : h how m how m uch im plicat ion would t here be t hat it
’s likely you ’re going t o be changing som et hing , as opposed t o
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : That was t he kind of disput e I was m aking before .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : I rem em ber t hat .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But , um , t he at t orneys , I [ disfm arker] uh , I can
guarant ee y ou , t he at t orneys will always com e back wit h [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : and we have t o decide how st ringent we want t o be in
t hese t hings ,
m e013 [ s] : but t hey will always com e back wit h saying [ vocalsound]
t hat , um , you need t o [ disfm arker] you want t o have som et h som e
paper t rail or [ disfm arker] which includes elect ronic t rail [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] t hat t hey have , uh , in fact [ pause] O K ’d it .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So , um ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : I t hink t hat if y ou f i if [ pause] we send t he em ail as you
have
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and if t here ’s half t he people , say , who don’t
respond [ pause] at all by , you know , som e period of t im e ,
[ v ocalsound] we can just m ake a list of t hese people
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and hand it t o , uh [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s] : y ou know , just give it t o m e
m e013 [ s] : and I ’ll hand it t o adm inist rat ive st aff or what ever ,
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and t hey ’ll just call t hem up and say , you know , "

[ disfm arker] you know , m ail Adam t hat it is , if i if it , you know , is or
not . "
m e013 [ s] : So , you know , we can [ disfm arker] we can do t hat .
fe016 [ s] : The ot her t hing t hat t here ’s a psychological effect t hat
[ disfm arker] at least for m ost people , t hat if t hey ’ve responded t o
y our em ail say ing " yes , I will do it " or " yes , I got your em ail " , t hey ’re
m ore likely t o act ually do it [ com m ent ] [ pause] lat er [ pause] t han t o
just ignore it .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : And of course we don’t want t hem t o bleep t hings out ,
fe016 [ s] : but it [ disfm arker] it ’s a lit t le bit bet t er if we ’re get t ing t he
[ disfm arker] t heir , uh , final response , once t hey ’ve answered you
once t han if t hey nev er answer you ’d [ com m ent ] at al at all .
fe016 [ s] : That ’s how t hese m ailing houses work .
fe016 [ s] : So , I m ean , it ’s not com plet ely lost work
fe016 [ s] : because it m ight benefit us in t erm s of get t ing [ pause]
responses .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : You know , an official OK from som ebody [ pause] is bet t er
t han no answer , even if t hey responded t hat t hey got your em ail .
fe016 [ s] : And t hey ’re probably m ore likely t o do t hat once t hey ’ve
responded t hat t hey got t he em ail .
fe008 [ s] : I also t hink t hey ’d just sim ply appreciat e it .
fe008 [ s^ e] : I t hink it ’s a good [ disfm arker] a good way of
[ disfm arker] of fost ering goodwill am ong our subject s .
fe008 [ s^ bsc] : Well , our part icipant s .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink t he m ain t hing is [ disfm arker] I m ean , what lawyers
do is t hey alway s look at worst cases .
m e011 [ s] : Sending lot s of spam .
m e013 [ s] : So t hey s so [ disfm arker] so [ disfm arker] Tha − t hat ’s what
t hey ’re paid t o do .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e013 [ s] : And so , [ vocalsound] it is cert ainly possible t hat , uh ,
som ebody ’s server would be down or som et hing
m e013 [ s] : and t hey wouldn’t act ually hear from us ,
m e013 [ s] : and t hen t hey find t his t hing is in t here
m e013 [ s] : and we ’ve already dist ribut ed it t o som eone .
m e013 [ s] : So , [ v ocalsound] what it says in t here , in fact , is t hat
t hey will be giv en an opport unit y t o blah − blah − blah ,
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ s] : but if in fact [ disfm arker] if we sent t hem som et hing or we
t hought we sent t hem som et hing but t hey didn’t act ually receive it for
som e reason , [ v ocalsound] um , t hen we haven’t given t hem t hat .
m e011 [ fg|qw] : Well , so how far do we have t o go ?
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Do we need t o get som eone ’s signat ure ?
m e011 [ qrr] : Or , is em ail enough ?
m e011 [ qy ^ j^ rt ] : Do we have t o have it not arized ?
m e013 [ s^ na] : I i i em em ail is enough .
m e011 [ fh] : I m ean [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Are you del are you bleeping it by adding ?
m e011 [ %−] : and t hen [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ %−] : Cuz [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s^ cs.%−−] : Oh . Cuz if y ou were sum m ing , you could
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ar|s^ bd.%−−] : No . But any way [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . It would be qui quit e easy t o get it back

[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qw^ br^ co] : Say again ?
fe008 [ qy .%−] : Once it ’s been successfully bleeped , can’t you rely on

m e001 [ s^ j^ na] : Yeah , t here y ou go .
fe016 [ s^ ba^ df] : Cuz we don’t have enough asides .
m n017 [ s] : I have an idea .
m n017 [ s^ cs^ j] : You reverse t he signal ,
m n017 [ s] : so it [ disfm arker] it let s people say what t hey said
backwards .
m e001 [ s] : There you go .
m e011 [ s] : Backwards .
m e001 [ s] : Then y ou have , like , sublim inal , uh , m essages ,
m e011 [ %−] : But ,
m e011 [ qy] : ha y ou ’ve seen t he [ disfm arker] t his [ disfm arker] t he

m n017 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e011 [ s] : It wouldn’t work .
m e011 [ s] : The speech recognizer st ill works .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : Yeah . And if you do it backward t hen [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : That ’s cuz t hey use forward − backward .
fe016 [ s^ ba^ j] : H − good old HMM .
m e011 [ s^ bk^ m |s^ aa] : Forward but backward . That ’s right .
fe016 [ s^ ar|s] : No , it ’s backward − forward .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Good point .
m e011 [ s^ aap] : A point .
m e011 [ fg|s^ fa] : Well , I ’m sorry if I sound a lit t le peeved about t his

m e011 [ s^ df] : It ’s just we ’ve had m eet ing aft er m eet ing aft er

m e011 [ s^ df] : Well , and t hat ’s ex act ly why I did it t he way I did it ,
m e011 [ s] : which is t he default is if y ou do not hing we ’re gonna

y ou ’d have a lot .
fe016 [ qw.%−−] : But [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] How [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , it also depends on how m any [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ ba] : Like , if we release [ disfm arker] t his t im e it ’s a fairly
sm all num ber of m eet ings ,
fe016 [ qh^ cs] : but what if we release , like , t went y − five m eet ings t o
people ?
m e011 [ s] : Well , what m y s expect at ion is , is t hat we ’ll send out one

m e001 [ s^ bk] : Oh . [ com m ent ] Uh − oh .
fe008 [ s] : And t hen you see anot her t ype of uncert aint y which is , you

fe008 [ s] : So inst ead of " split upon unknown " , [ com m ent ] it ’s " split

m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e001 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Jane , t hese are from IBM ?

fe008 [ fg|s] : Um . OK , t he next one ,

fe008 [ s:s] : inst ead of " from som et hing − or − ot her cards " ,
[ com m ent ] it ’s " for m ult icast " .
fe008 [ s:s] : And inst ead of " ANN syst em relat ed " , it ’s " end syst em

fe008 [ s] : This was changed t o an acrony m init ially
fe008 [ s] : and it should shouldn’t hav e been .
fe008 [ s] : And t hen , you can see here " GPS " was m isint erpret ed .
fe008 [ s^ by .%−−] : It ’s just t ot ally underst anda
fe008 [ s] : This is [ disfm arker] t his is a lot of jargon .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Um , and t he final one ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : t he t ranscriber had t h " in t he core net work it self

m n017 [ s^ aa] : Mm m .
fe008 [ s^ ba.%−−] : And t hey ’re generally ext rem ely good ,
fe008 [ s] : but , y ou know in t his [ disfm arker] t his area it really does

fe008 [ s] : and I ’m hoping t hat when t he checked versions are run
t hrough t he recognizer t hat you ’ll see s subst ant ial im provem ent s in

fe008 [ s] : cuz t he [ disfm arker] you know , t here ’re a lot of t hese in

m n017 [ fg|qw.%−] : Yeah . So how oft en [ disfm arker] ?
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah , but I bet [ disfm arker] I bet t hey ’re acoust ically

m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh , so it ’s just jargon .
fe008 [ s^ bk^ m |s^ aa] : It ’s jargon . Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ df] : I m ean t his is [ disfm arker] cuz , you know you don’t

m n017 [ %−] : Well , but [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : And it ’s jar it ’s jargon coupled wit h a foreign accent .
m n017 [ s] : But we don’t [ disfm arker] I m ean , our language m odel

m n017 [ fh] : So ,
m n017 [ s] : you know , un unt il y ou act ually [ pause] get a decent

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : It probably won’t do any bet t er .
m n017 [ s] : You probably won’t not ice a difference .
m n017 [ s^ ba] : But it ’s [ disfm arker] I m ean , it ’s definit ely good t hat
t hese are fixed .
m n017 [ s^ bd] : I m ean , [ vocalsound] obviously .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : Well , also from t he st andpoint of get t ing people ’s approval
,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : cuz if som eone sees a page full of uh , um , barely

m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Did I say t hat ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

.
fe008 [ b.x ] : OK .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : Well , t hat ’s exact ly why I put t he ext ra opt ion in ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa|s] : Exact ly . That ’s why we discussed t hat .
m e011 [ s] : is t hat I was afraid people would say , " let ’s censor t hat

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : and I don’t want t hem t o do t hat .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : And t hen I also [ disfm arker] t he final t hing I have for

m n017 [ %−−] : C
fe008 [ s^ df] : because of t he problem of low gain in t he originals .
fe008 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and t hey v ery m uch appro t hey m u m uch

fe008 [ s] : and act ually I [ disfm arker] I m ean , I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat
t here will be fewer t hings t o correct because of t he [ disfm arker] t he

fe008 [ s] : We ’d originally chosen , uh , very expensive head headset s
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
