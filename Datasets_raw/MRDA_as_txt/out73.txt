[ nonv ocalsound] m ay be point ing in a funny direct ion .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s not t hat long .
m e025 [ s^ cs] : Sort of it ’s [ disfm arker] it helps if it point s sort of

fe041 [ s^ fe] : Whoops .
m e025 [ s.%−−] : Sort of it [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s^ f] : you know .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
fe041 [ qy .%−−] : Would it [ disfm arker] m
m e025 [ s] : So t hat t hing [ disfm arker] t he lit t le [ disfm arker] t h t hat

m e025 [ s^ na] : That ’s it .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .

m e025 [ s^ ba] : That ’s good .
fe041 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e025 [ s^ ba] : That kind of t hing is good .
fe008 [ %−−] : It ’s a [ disfm arker]

m e025 [ s^ ba] : It ’s working .
fe041 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Alright .
m e013 [ s^ t ^ t c] : So what we had [ pause] was t hat we were gonna

m e013 [ s] : and , um , uh , you [ disfm arker] you put up t here dat a

fe041 [ %−] : Um .
m e013 [ s] : and ot her t asks during dat a collect ion ,
fe041 [ qh.%−−] : So , I t hink t he goal [ disfm arker] t he goal was what
can we do [ disfm arker] how can you do t he dat a collect ion different ly
t o get [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ qh] : what can you add t o it t o get , um , som e inform at ion t hat
would be helpful for t he user − int erface design ?
fe041 [ %−] : Like [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Uh , especially for querying .
fe041 [ s^ m ^ na] : Especially for querying .
fe041 [ s] : So , get t ing people t o do queries aft erwards ,
fe041 [ s] : get t ing people t o do sum m aries aft erwards .
fe041 [ fh] : Um .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well , one t hing t hat cam e up in t he m orning
[ disfm arker] in t he m orning was t he , um ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : i uh , if he [ disfm arker] I , um [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : if he has [ disfm arker] s
fe008 [ s^ df^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t rem em ber ,
fe008 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Mist er Lan − Doct or Landry ?
fe008 [ s^ bu^ m ^ rt ] : La − Landay ?
m e011 [ s] : Landay . Jam es .
fe008 [ s] : So he has , um , t hese , uh , um , t sk [ com m ent ] not e −
t aking t hings ,
fe008 [ s] : t hen t hat would sort of be a sum m ary which you wouldn’t
have t o solicit .
fe041 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : y if [ disfm arker] if we were able t o [ disfm arker] t o do t hat .
fe041 [ s^ aap] : Well , if [ disfm arker] if you act ually t ake not es as a
sum m ary as opposed t o n t ake not es in t he sense of t aking advant age
of t he t im e − st am ps .
fe041 [ s:s] : So act ion it em or uh , rem inder t o send t his t o so − and −
so , blah − blah − blah .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe041 [ s] : So t hat wouldn’t be a sum m ary .
fe041 [ s] : That would just be [ disfm arker] t hat would b relat e t o t he

fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e011 [ s^ df^ nd] : But if we had t he CrossPads , we could ask people
, you know , if [ disfm arker] if som et hing com es up [ vocalsound] writ e it

m e011 [ s^ f] : you know .
m e025 [ s^ aa|s] : Right . I m ean , we [ disfm arker] because you ’d have

m e025 [ s^ df] : I m ean , cuz I t end t o t ake not es which are sum m aries .
fe041 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e025 [ %−−] : And so , you know [ disfm arker]

fe041 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ e] : pret t y easily .
fe041 [ s^ aa|s^ cs] : Yeah . We also could com e up wit h som e code for

fe041 [ s] : I m ean , it ’s t o som e ex t ent , uh , for his benefit .
fe041 [ fh] : So ,

fe008 [ s.%−−] : You know , t he Jim let [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ df^ e.%−−] : I m ean , t he box t hat cont ains t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Well , I m ean , suppose we broaden out and go t o a range

m e013 [ s] : There ’s gonna be lot s of t hings t hat any group of people

fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , we [ disfm arker] we were originally gonna do t his
wit h VLSI design ,
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and t he reason we

m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ s^ aap] : Well , t hat was just one of t he reasons .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : But , yeah , definit ely .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK . Good .
m e013 [ s^ na] : That [ disfm arker] t hat ’s right .
m e013 [ s] : There were ot hers of course .
m e013 [ b.%] : Yeah .
fe008 [ fg|s^ t ^ t c] : OK , so we were on t he dat a collect ion [ pause]

m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%] : We can go back .
fe041 [ fg] : So ,

fe041 [ s] : There ’s t he CrossPad issue .
fe041 [ qh] : Should we do it and , if so , what ’ll we have t hem do ?
fe041 [ qh] : Um , do we have s people writ e sum m aries ?
fe041 [ qh] : Everybody or one person ?
fe041 [ qh] : And t hen , do we ask people for how t hey would query

m e022 [ s] : There ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’re sub − problem s in t hat ,
fe041 [ %−] : Is t hat [ disfm arker]
m e022 [ qh^ e] : in t hat where [ disfm arker] or when do you act ually ask

m e022 [ s] : I m ean , t hat was [ disfm arker] One t hing I was t hinking

ask t hem t hen .
fe041 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe041 [ b] : Right .
m e022 [ s.%−−] : But t here ’s a problem wit h t hat in t hat if [ pause] you
’re not [ disfm arker]
m e022 [ s] : If you don’t have an int eract iv e syst em , it ’s gonna be

fe041 [ s^ aa] : Right .

m e022 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right .
m e022 [ s^ e] : And furt h id explore t he dat a furt her .
fe041 [ b] : Right .
m e022 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ %−−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : There ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s anot her problem
m e013 [ s] : which is , um , we cert ainly do want t o branch out beyond ,
uh , uh , recording m eet ings about Meet ing Recorder .
m e013 [ s] : And , uh , once we get out bey ond our lit t le group , t he
people ’s m ot ivat ion fact or , uh , reduces enorm ously .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And if we st art giving t hem a bunch of ot her t hings t o
do ,
m e013 [ s] : how [ disfm arker] you know , we [ disfm arker] we did n you
know anot her m eet ing here for anot her group
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and , uh , t hey were fine wit h it .
m e013 [ qh^ df.%−] : But if we ’d said , " OK , now all eight of you have t o
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] have t o com e up wit h , uh , t he sum m ar "
m e011 [ s] : Well , I asked t hem t o
m e011 [ s] : and none of t hem did .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : t See ?
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ e] : So , I [ disfm arker] I asked t hem t o send m e ideas for

m e013 [ s] : There we go .
fe041 [ %−] : They [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : and no one ever did .
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ bd^ df] : I didn’t follow up eit her .
m e011 [ s^ bd^ e:s] : So I didn’t t rack t hem down and say " please do t h
do it now " .
fe041 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : But , uh , no one spont aneously provided anyt hing .
m e013 [ %−] : I
m e013 [ s] : I ’m worried t hat if y ou did [ disfm arker] even if you did push
t hem int o it , it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it m ight be sem i − random ,
fe041 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ e] : uh , as opposed t o what you ’d really want t o know if
y ou were gonna use t his t hing .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ df^ no:s] : I just don’t know how else t o generat e t he
queries ot her t han get t ing an ex pert t o act ually list en t o t he m eet ing
and say " t hat ’s im port ant ,
fe041 [ b] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ df^ e:s] : t hat m ight be a query " .
fe008 [ %] : Tsk .

fe008 [ s^ df^ ng] : Well , t here is t his ot her t hing which y which you
were alluding t o earlier , which is , um , t here are cert ain key words like
, you know , " act ion it em " and t hings like t hat ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : which could be used in , uh , t t o som e degree finding
t he st ruct ure .
m e025 [ %−] : Alt hough [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe041 [ %−] : W
fe008 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and I also , um , was t hinking , wit h
reference t o t he n uh , not e − t aking ,
fe008 [ s] : t he advant age t here is t hat y ou get st ruct ure wit hout t he
person having t o do som et hing art ificial lat er .
fe008 [ s] : And t he fir t hird t hing I want ed t o say is t he sum m aries
aft erwards ,
fe008 [ s] : um , I t hink t hey should be recorded inst ead of writ t en
fe008 [ s^ df] : because I t hink t hat , um , it would t ake so long for
people t o writ e t hat I t hink you wouldn’t get as good a sum m ary .
fe041 [ qw] : How about t his idea ?
fe041 [ s^ cs] : That norm ally at m ost m eet ings som ebody is delegat ed
t o be a not e − t aker .
fe008 [ s^ aa|s^ ba] : Yeah , good .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Good point .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe041 [ qh^ cs] : And [ disfm arker] So why don’t we just use t he not es
t hat som ebody t akes ?
m e011 [ s^ aap] : I m ean , t hat gives you a sum m ary
m e011 [ s^ nd.%−−] : but it doesn’t really [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qh^ df^ ng] : How do y ou generat e queries from t hat ?
m e025 [ s] : Well . But , I m ean , m aybe a sum m ary is one of t he t hings
we ’d want from t he out put of t he syst em .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
fe041 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e025 [ s^ df] : I m ean , t hey ’re som et hing .
m e025 [ s] : It ’s a [ disfm arker] a kind of out put you ’d like .
fe016 [ %−] : Act ually [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Uh , Jam es and I were t alking about t his during one of t he
breaks .
fe016 [ %−] : And so [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : And t he problem wit h t hat is , I ’m definit ely going t o do
som et hing wit h inform at ion ret riev al
m e011 [ s^ e] : ev en if it ’s sort of not full full − bore what I ’m gonna do
for m y t hesis .
fe041 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : I ’m gonna do som et hing .
m e011 [ s] : I ’m not gonna do anyt hing wit h sum m arizat ion .

m e011 [ s] : And so if som eone want s t o do t hat , t hat ’s fine ,
m e011 [ s] : but it ’s not gonna be m e .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Well , I t hink t hat we [ disfm arker] I m ean , t he
[ disfm arker] t he f t he core t hing is t hat you know once we get som e of
t hese issues nailed down , we need t o do a bunch of recordings
fe041 [ %−] : Well [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ cs^ e] : and send t hem off t o IBM
m e013 [ s] : and get a bunch of t ranscript ions
m e013 [ s^ e] : ev en if t hey ’re slight ly flawed
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e013 [ s^ e.%−−] : or need som e ot her [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : And t hen we ’ll have som e dat a t here .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen , i i we can st art l looking and t hinking , what do
we want t o know about t hese t hings
fe041 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : and [ disfm arker] at t he very least .
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : I act ually want t o say som et hing about t he not e pad .
fe041 [ b] : Yeah [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : So , if you could sense just when people are writ ing , and
y ou t ell t hem not t o doodle , or t ry not t o [ pause] be using t hat for

just get it when t hey com e in t he room . Then you c you can just have
a fff [ com m ent ] plot of wh you know , who ’s writ ing when .
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
m e025 [ s^ 2] : Act ivit y .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : That ’s all you [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : And , you can also hav e not es of t he m eet ing .
fe016 [ s] : But I bet t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat will allow you t o go int o
t he [ disfm arker] sort of t he hot places where people are writ ing t hings
down .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see .
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , y ou can t ell when you ’re in a m eet ing when
ev ery body st ops t o writ e som et hing down t hat som et hing was just said
.
fe041 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : It m ay not be kept in t he lat er sum m ary ,
fe016 [ s] : but at t hat point in t im e is was som et hing t hat was
im port ant .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ df.%−−] : And t hat wouldn’t t ake any ext ra [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s a nice idea .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : Or som eone could just pu you could just put your hand
on t he pad

m e013 [ %−] : It [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn043 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ cs^ e] : and go like t hat if you want t o .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : That ’s a good idea
fe016 [ %−] : It ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but t hat doesn’t [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bd^ df] : Maybe I ’m m issing som et hing ,
m e013 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g] : but t hat doesn’t get t o t he quest ion of how
we com e up wit h queries , right ?
fe016 [ fg|s^ df] : Well , t hen you can go t o t he point s where t he
[ disfm arker] you could act ually go t o t hose point s in t im e
fe041 [ s.%−] : Well , what it does [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ df^ e] : and find out what t hey were t alking about .
fe016 [ s.%−] : And y ou r
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe041 [ s.%−−] : Well , what it does is prov ide a different [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ %] : Uh , y
fe041 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s an int erest ing t hing .
fe041 [ s^ rt ] : I don’t t hink it get s at t he [ disfm arker] t he queries per −
se ,
fe041 [ s] : but it does give us an inform at ion fusion sort of t hing t hat ,
y ou know , y ou wanna i say " what were t he hot − point s of t he m eet ing
?"
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : That [ disfm arker] t hat ’s what I m ean , is t hat I t hink it get s
at som et hing int erest ing
m e013 [ s^ df] : but if we were asking t he quest ion , which I t hought we
were , of [ disfm arker] of [ disfm arker] of , um , " how do we figure out
what ’s t he nat ure of t he queries t hat people are gonna want t o ask of
such a sy st em ? " , knowing what ’s im port ant doesn’t t ell you what
people are going t o be asking .
fe016 [ s^ df^ ng] : But I bet it ’s a good [ pause] superset of it .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Does it ?
m e025 [ s.%−] : Well , see , t here are t h
fe041 [ s^ aa] : Well , yeah .
fe041 [ s] : I t hink y ou could say t hey ’re gonna ask about , uh , when
[ disfm arker] uh , when did so − and − so s t alk about blah .
fe041 [ s] : And at least t hat gives you t he word [ pause] t hat t hey
m ight run a query on .
fe016 [ s] : At least y ou can find t he locat ions where t here are m aybe
keywords
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , i t his would t ell y ou what t he hit is ,
m e013 [ s^ am ] : May be .
fe016 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]

m e011 [ s] : not what t he query is .
m e011 [ %−] : What [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right , right .
fe041 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe041 [ s^ na] : It ’ll t ell you t he hit but not t he query .
fe016 [ s] : But I t hink [ disfm arker] I t hink t hinking about queries is a
lit t le bit dangerous right now .
m e011 [ s] : And so y ou could [ disfm arker] you can generat e a query
from t he hit s ,
m e011 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : We don’t even know what [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , if you want t o find out what any user will use , t hat
m ight be t rue for one dom ain and one user ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s.%−] : but I m ean a different dom ain and a different user
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fg|s^ df] : Yeah , but we ’re just looking for a place t o st art wit h
t hat
fe016 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ s^ df] : because , you know , t h what [ disfm arker] what
[ disfm arker] what Jam es is gonna be doing is looking at t he user −
int erface
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and he ’s looking at t he query in [ disfm arker] in
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : i We [ disfm arker] we have five hours of pilot dat a of t he
ot her st uff
m e013 [ s] : but we have zero hours of [ disfm arker] of [ disfm arker] of
queries .
m e013 [ s:qw] : So he ’s just sort of going " where [ disfm arker] where
do I [ disfm arker] where do I st art ? "
fe041 [ %−] : w
fe041 [ s^ cs.%−−] : Well , t h you could do [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ s] : I t hink t he sum m aries act ually m ay help get us t here ,
m e013 [ b] : OK .
fe041 [ s^ e] : for a couple reasons .
fe041 [ s] : One , if y ou have a sum m ary [ disfm arker] if you have a
bunch of sum m aries , you can do a word frequency count and see
what words com e up in different t ypes of m eet ings .
m e013 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
fe041 [ s] : So " act ion it em " is gonna com e up whet her it ’s a VLSI
m eet ing , or speech m eet ing , or what ev er .
fe041 [ s] : So words t hat com e up in different t ypes of m eet ings m ay
be som et hing t hat y ou would want t o query about .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

fe041 [ s:qw] : Um , t he second t hing y ou could possibly do wit h it is
just run a lit t le pilot experim ent wit h som ebody saying " here ’s a
sum m ary of a m eet ing , what quest ions m ight you want t o ask about it
t o go back ? "
m e011 [ fg|s^ ba^ nd] : Yeah , I t hink t hat ’s difficult
m e011 [ s^ df] : because t hen t hey ’re not gonna ask t he quest ions
t hat are in t he sum m ary .
fe041 [ %−] : Well [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.%−] : But , I t hink it would give [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ s] : That ’s one possi one possible scenario , t hough , is you
have t he sum m ary ,
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe041 [ s^ e] : and y ou want t o ask quest ions t o get m ore det ail .
m e011 [ s] : t h Yeah , I t hink it has t o be a part icipant .
m e011 [ s] : Well , it doesn’t have t o be .
m e011 [ s] : OK . So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat is anot her use of Meet ing
Recorder t hat we haven’t really t alked about ,
m e011 [ s] : which is for som eone else ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : as opposed t o as a [ pause] rem em brance agent ,
m e011 [ s] : which is what had been m y prim ary t hought in t he
inform at ion ret riev al part of it would be .
m e011 [ fh] : But , uh ,
m e011 [ s] : I guess if you had a m eet ing part icipant , t hey could use
t he sum m ary t o refresh t hem selves about t he m eet ing and t hen m ake
up queries .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : But it ’s not [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ no] : I don’t know how t o do it if [ disfm arker] unt il you have
a syst em .
fe016 [ s] : The sum m ary is act ually gonna drive t he queries t hen .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
fe041 [ b] : Mm m .
fe016 [ s^ e] : I m ean , your research is going t o be very circular .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s what I was saying
.
fe041 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s] : But t h t here is t his , um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
[ v ocalsound] [ v ocalsound] There is t his class of queries , which are t he
t hings t hat you didn’t realize were im port ant at t he t im e
m e025 [ s^ df^ e:qy] : but som e in ret rospect you t hink " oh , hang on ,
didn’t we t alk about t hat ? "
m e025 [ s.%−−] : And it ’s som et hing t hat didn’t appear in t he sum m ary
but y ou [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e025 [ s] : And t hat ’s kind of what t his kind of , uh , com plet e dat a
capt ure is kind of nicest for .

fe041 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e025 [ s^ df] : Cuz it ’s t he t hings t hat you wouldn’t have bot hered t o
m ake an effort t o record but t hey get recorded .
fe041 [ b] : Right .
m e025 [ s] : So , I m ean [ disfm arker] And t h t here ’s no way of
generat ing t hose , u u unt il we just [ disfm arker] unt il t hey act ually
occur .
m e025 [ s.%−] : You know , it ’s like [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ cs^ df] : But you could always post − hoc label t hem .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Right , right . Exact ly .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s:qw] : But I m ean , it ’s difficult t o sort of say " and if I was
gonna ask four quest ions about t his , what would t hey be ? "
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s] : Those aren’t t he kind of t hings t hat com e up .
m e011 [ s^ df] : But at least it would get us st art ed .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Oh , yeah .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , sure .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I also t hink t hat w if [ disfm arker] if you can use t he
sum m aries as an indicat ion of t he im port ant point s of t he [ disfm arker]
of t he m eet ing , t hen you m ight get som et hing like [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : y So if t h if t he obscure it em you want t o know m ore about
was som e form of dat a collect ion ,
fe008 [ s:s] : y ou know , m aybe t he sum m ary would say , you know , "
we discussed t y pes of na dat a collect ion " .
fe008 [ s] : And , y ou know [ disfm arker] And [ disfm arker] and m aybe
y ou could get t o it by t hat .
fe008 [ s] : If y ou [ disfm arker] if you had t he [ disfm arker] t he larger
st ruct ure of t he [ disfm arker] of t he discourse , t hen if you can
cat egorize what it is t hat you ’re looking for wit h reference t o t hose l
t hose larger headings , t hen you can find it
fe008 [ s^ e] : ev en if you don’t hav e a direct rout e t o t hat .
m e011 [ b.%] : Mm m .
fe008 [ s.%−] : I t hink t hat [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ba^ df^ ng] : Alt hough it seem s like t hat ’s , um , a high
burden on t he not e − t aker .
m e011 [ s^ e] : That ’s a pret t y fine grain t hat t he not e − t aker will have
t o t ake .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : May be Landay can put a st udent in t o be a not e − t aker
.
fe041 [ %−] : I t h
fe041 [ s^ ar] : No .
fe041 [ s^ df] : I t hink you got t o have som ebody who knows t he pro

be t he not e − t aker .

fe016 [ qw^ br^ m ] : No ?
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe041 [ s^ e] : Som ebody who ’s part of t he m eet ing .
fe016 [ s^ ar|s^ df.%−−] : No , I m ean , but som eone who can com e sit in
on t he m eet ings and t hen t akes t he not es wit h t hem t hat t he real
not e − t aker [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ %−] : But t hey [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : And t hat way t hat one st udent has , you know , a rough
idea of what was going on ,
fe016 [ s] : and t hey can use it for t heir research .
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , t his isn’t really necessarily what you would do in a

m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ df] : because t hat t hat ’s a lot of t rouble
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : and m aybe it ’s not t he best way t o do it .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : But if he has som e st udent s t hat want t o st udy t hat
t hen t hey should sort of get t o know t he people and at t end t hose
m eet ings ,
fe016 [ s^ cs^ e] : and get t he not es from t he not e − t aker or som et hing
.
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b.%] : Hm m .
m e011 [ s^ nd] : Well , I t hink t hat ’s a lit t le bit of a problem .
m e011 [ s] : Their sort of not e − t aking applicat ion st uff
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : t hey ’ve been doing for t he last couple of years ,
m e011 [ s] : and I don’t t hink any one is st ill working on it .
m e011 [ s] : I t hink t hey ’re done .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Um , so I ’m not sure t hat t hey have anyone current ly
working on not es .
m e011 [ s] : So what we ’d hav e t o int erest som eone in is t he
com binat ion of not e and speech .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ qh] : And so t he quest ion is " is t here such a person ? "
m e011 [ s] : And I t hink right now , t he answer is " no " .
m e013 [ s] : I ’ve b been t hinking [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ %−] : Well
m e011 [ s^ ng] : We ’ll just have t o see .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I ’v e been t hinking about it a lit t le bit here [ disfm arker]
about t he [ disfm arker] uh , t h t his , e um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I t hink t hat t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : now I ’m t hinking t hat t he sum m ary [ disfm arker] a sum m ary
, uh , is act ually a reasonable , uh , boot st rap int o t his [ disfm arker]
int o what we ’d like t o get at .

m e013 [ s^ ba^ bd] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not ideal ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : but we [ disfm arker] you know , we [ disfm arker] we have
t o get st art ed som eplace .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So I was [ disfm arker] I was just t hinking about , um ,
suppose we want ed t o get [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : w We have t his collect ion of m eet ing .
m e013 [ s] : We have five hours of st uff .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , we get t hat t ranscribed .
m e013 [ s] : So now we have five hours of m eet ings
m e013 [ s:qw] : and , uh , you ask m e , uh , uh , " Morgan , what d you
know , what kind of quest ions do y ou want t o ask ? "
m e013 [ s^ no] : Uh , I wouldn’t have any idea what kind of quest ions I
want t o ask .
m e013 [ s] : I ’d hav e t o get st art ed som eplace .
m e013 [ s:s] : So in fact if I looked at sum m ary of it , I ’d go " oh , yeah ,
I was in t hat m eet ing ,
m e013 [ s:s] : I rem em ber t hat ,
m e013 [ s.%−−:qw.%−−] : um , what was t he part t hat [ disfm arker] "
m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and t h I t hink t hat m ight t hen help m e t o
t hink of t hings [ disfm arker] ev en t hings t hat aren’t list ed in t he

what t he general t hing was going on in t he m eet ing .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe041 [ s] : I t hink it serves t wo purpo purposes .
fe041 [ s] : One , as sort of a refresh t o help boot st rap queries ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe041 [ s] : but also , I m ean , m aybe we do want t o generat e
sum m aries .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Well , yeah . That ’s t rue t oo .
fe041 [ s] : And t hen it ’s [ disfm arker] you know , it ’s kind of a key .
m e025 [ b] : Hm m .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , absolut ely . Then you want t o have it .
fe016 [ qw] : So how does t he sum m ary get generat ed ?
fe041 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ df^ rt ] : I ’m not against t he idea of a sum m ary ,
fe041 [ %−] : Well , i i [ disfm arker] ?
m e011 [ s] : By hand .
fe016 [ s^ df] : but I want ed t o t hink carefully about who ’s generat ing it
fe041 [ %−] : Or , d o
fe016 [ s^ df^ e.%−−] : and how [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ df] : because t he sum m ary will drive t he queries .
fe016 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ s] : What I [ disfm arker] I t hink , you know , in m ost m eet ings ,
fe041 [ s^ bd] : t his one being [ pause] different ,

fe041 [ s] : but in m ost m eet ings t hat I at t end , t here ’s som ebody t

fe041 [ s] : Um , y ou can just m ake it be on a lapt op ,
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe041 [ s^ df] : so t hen yo you ’re dealing wit h ASCII
fe041 [ s^ df^ e.%−−] : and not som ebody [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ s^ df^ e] : you don’t have t o go t hrough handwrit ing recognit ion
.
fe041 [ s] : Um , and t hen t hey post − edit it int o , uh , a sum m ary
fe041 [ s] : and t hey em ail it out for m inut es .
fe041 [ s] : I m ean , t hat happens in m ost m eet ings .
fe008 [ s^ df^ rt ] : I I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat , um , t here ’s [ disfm arker]
we ’re using " sum m ary " in t wo different ways .
fe008 [ s] : So what y ou just described I would describe as " m inut es " .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Minut es .
m e025 [ b.%] : Yeah .
fe041 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe008 [ s.%−−:qw] : And what I originally t hought was , um , if you asked
som eone " what was t he m eet ing about ? "
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ e:s] : And t hen t hey would say " well , we t alked about t his
fe041 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s^ e:s] : and t hen we t alked about t hat ,
fe008 [ s^ e:s] : and so − and − so t alked about [ disfm arker] "
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And t hen you ’d hav e , like [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] e My t hought was t o have m ult iple people

fe008 [ s^ df] : because writ ing t akes t im e

t hat [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Whereas if you just say it im m ediat ely aft er t he m eet ing
,
fe008 [ s] : you know , a t wo − m inut e sum m ary of what t he m eet ing was

fe008 [ s^ e.%−−] : uh , wit h m ult
fe008 [ s] : See , I [ disfm arker] I also worry about having a single not e −

fe008 [ s^ df] : because t hat ’s just one person ’s percept ion .
fe008 [ fh] : And , um ,
fe008 [ s^ df^ e] : you know , it [ disfm arker] it ’s releva it ’s relat ive t o
what y ou ’re focus was on t hat m eet ing ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ df^ e] : and [ disfm arker] and people have different

m e013 [ %−] : A
fe008 [ s^ cs] : So , m y proposal would be t hat it m ay be wort h

fe041 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m e013 [ s.%−] : Adam , you can [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ e] : from m ult iple people .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df] : y ou can correct m e on t his ,
m e013 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] but , uh , m y im pression was t hat , uh ,

m e011 [ s^ na] : Never .

m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s] : I ’v e d When we [ disfm arker] when we have ot her m eet ings

m e013 [ s] : Most of t he m eet ings we have are four or five people
m e011 [ s^ na|s^ 2] : That ’s t rue [ disfm arker] are four or five people .

m e013 [ s] : They [ disfm arker] t hey [ disfm arker] t hey [ disfm arker] t hey

fe016 [ s] : And t here ’s also I t hink a personal int erest on t he part of
Mark Liberm an in t his kind of [ disfm arker] in st oring t hese im ages in
any dat a we collect
m e013 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .

fe016 [ s] : so t hat lat er we can do ot her t hings wit h it .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So [ disfm arker] so t o address what [ disfm arker] what
Adam ’s saying ,
fe008 [ b] : Mm m .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , I t hink you [ disfm arker] uh , t hat
fe016 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : t he key t hing t here is t hat t his is a descript ion of dat abase
collect ion effort t hat t hey ’re t alking about doing .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And if t he dat abase exist s and includes som e visual

m ake any use of it .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g] : Right ?
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So , uh [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ df^ ng] : But t hat [ disfm arker] it ’s gonna be a lot of effort
on our part t o creat e it , and st ore it ,
m e011 [ s] : and get all t he st andards , and t o do anyt hing wit h it .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−] : So we ’re gonna [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So we ’re gonna do what we ’re gonna do ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : what ever ’s reasonable for us .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs.%−−] : I t hink even doing som et hing very crude [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : But having [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ e] : Like I know wit h ATIS , we just had a t ape recorder
running all t he t im e .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : And lat er on it t urned out it was really good t hat you had a
t ape recorder of what was happening ,
fe016 [ s] : ev en t hough you w you just got t he speech from t he
m achine .
fe016 [ s.%−] : So if you can find som e really , you know , low , uh ,
perplex it y ,
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Low fidelit y .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : y eah , [ com m ent ] way of [ disfm arker] of doing t hat , I
t hink it would be wort hwhile .
fe008 [ s^ na] : I agree .
fe008 [ s^ df.%−] : And if it ’s sim ple as [ disfm arker] I m ean , as sim ple
as just t he digit al [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : Ot herwise you ’d [ disfm arker] you lose it .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s] : Well , m inim ally , I m ean , what [ disfm arker] what Dan is
referring t o at least having som e represent at ion of t he p t he spat ial
posit ion of t he people ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : cuz we are int erest ed in som e spat ial processing .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : And so [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe041 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : so , um [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Well , once t he room is a lit t le m ore fixed t hat ’s a lit t le
easier
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ df.%−−] : cuz you ’ll [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Well , t he wireless .
m e013 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : Also CMU has been doing t his
fe016 [ s] : and t hey were t he m ost vocal at t his m eet ing ,
fe016 [ s^ e] : Alex Waibel ’s group .
fe016 [ s] : And t hey have [ pause] said , I t alked t o t he st udent who
had done t his , [ com m ent ] t hat wit h t wo fairly inexpensive cam eras
t hey [ disfm arker] t hey just recorded all t he t im e
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : and were able t o get all t he inform at ion from [ disfm arker] or
m ay be it was t hree [ disfm arker] from all t he part s of t he room .
fe016 [ s^ df] : So I t hink we would be [ disfm arker] we m ight lose t he
chance t o use t his dat a for som ebody lat er who want s t o do som e kind
of processing on it if we don’t collect it [ com m ent ] at all .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ na^ rt ] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I don’t disagree .
m e011 [ s] : I t hink t hat if you hav e t hat , t hen people who are
int erest ed in vision can use t his dat abase . The problem wit h it is you
’ll have m ore people who don’t want t o be film ed t han who don’t want
t o be recorded .
fe008 [ s^ df.%−] : Well , she ’s not [ pause] m aking [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ df^ e:s] : So t hat t here ’s going t o be anot her group of

fn043 [ b] : Mm m .
fn043 [ s^ na] : That ’s t rue .
fe041 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : Or y ou could put a paper bag over everybody ’s head
m e011 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : and not look at each ot her
fe016 [ s] : and not look at boards ,
fe016 [ s] : and just all be sit t ing [ vocalsound] t alking .

fe016 [ s.%−] : That would be an int eres [ v ocalsound] Bu
fe008 [ s|s^ aa] : Well , t here ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’d be t he [ disfm arker]
t he parallel , yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Great idea .
fe008 [ s^ df.%−] : But I t hink y she ’s [ disfm arker] we ’re just proposing

fe016 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . I definit ely won’t part icipat e if t here ’s a

fe008 [ s^ e] : sp spat ial organizat ion [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ cs] : And y ou could anonym ize t he faces for t hat m at t er .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : You know , I m ean , t his is [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−] : We can t alk about t he [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ df^ nd] : But , you know , t hat ’s a lot of infrast ruct ure and

fe008 [ s^ df] : It ’s just one snapshot .

fe008 [ s^ r] : We ’re t alking about a snapshot .

m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : And t hey had [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Well , I t hink for [ disfm arker] I m ean , for our purposes
we probably will d
fe016 [ s^ no] : I ’m not sure .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : we [ disfm arker] we m ight t ry t hat som e

fe008 [ b] : Yeah .

fe008 [ %−] : Th
fe008 [ s] : The t hing is , if it ’s easy t o collect it [ disfm arker] it t h t hen I
t hink it ’s a wise t hing t o do
fe008 [ s^ df] : because once it ’s gone it ’s gone .
fe008 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : I ’m just [ disfm arker] The com m unit y [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : If LDC collect s t his dat a [ disfm arker] u I m ean , and L − if
Mark Liberm an is a st rong proponent of how t hey collect it and what
t hey collect , t here will probably be som e v ideo dat a in t here .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : There you go .
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : And so t hat could argue for us not doing it
fe016 [ s] : or it could argue for us doing it .
fe016 [ s] : The only place where it sort of overlaps is when som e of t he

[ disfm arker] m ade easier if you had [ pause] t he video .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ s] : As y ou say , if t hey [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] if t hey decide
it ’s really crit ical t hen t hey will collect a lot m ore dat a t han we can

fe016 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I ’m not worried about t he cost

fe041 [ %−] : e
m e013 [ s] : I ’m worried about t he cost of people looking at it .

m e013 [ s^ df] : In ot her words , it ’s [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it ’d be

m e013 [ s^ cs] : And so I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat we do

m e013 [ s^ cs] : But I [ disfm arker] I am int I do t hink t hat we m m inim ally

m e013 [ s^ cs^ e] : Like for a m eet ing like t his , at least , uh , t ake a

fe016 [ s^ df] : I m ean , ot herwise lat er on if nobody wrot e t his st uff on

m e013 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : uh , so I guess t hat ’s t h t he way [ disfm arker] what
y ou were figuring on doing was [ disfm arker] was [ disfm arker] was , uh ,
put t ing t oget her som e not es and sending t hem t o [ disfm arker] t o
ev ery body
m e013 [ s^ e] : from [ disfm arker] from t oday ?
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s great .
m e013 [ s^ t ] : So [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] so t he quest ion [ com m ent ]
t hat [ disfm arker] t hat we st art ed wit h was whet her t here was anyt hing
else we should do during [ disfm arker] during t h during t he collect ion .
fe016 [ s^ ba^ t 1.%] : Ow .
m e013 [ s] : And I guess t he CrossPads was cert ainly one idea ,
m e013 [ s] : uh , and we ’ll get t hem from him and we ’ll just do t hat .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e013 [ s] : And t hen t he next t hing we t alked about was t he
[ disfm arker] was t he sum m aries
m e013 [ qh] : and are we gonna do anyt hing about t hat .

fe041 [ s] : Well , before we leave t he CrossPads and [ disfm arker] and
call it done .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
fe041 [ s.x ] : So , if I ’m collect ing dat a t hen t here is t his quest ion of do
I use CrossPads ?
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe041 [ s] : So , I t hink t hat if we really seriously have m e collect dat a
and I can’t use CrossPads , it ’s probably less useful for you guys t o go
t o t he t rouble of using it ,
fe041 [ fh|s^ df.%−−] : um , unless you t hink t hat t he CrossPads are
gonna [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ %−−] : n
fe041 [ s^ no] : I ’m not [ disfm arker] I ’m not sure what t hey ’re gonna
do .
fe041 [ s.%−−] : But [ disfm arker] but having a sm all percent age of t he
dat a wit h it ,
fe041 [ s] : I ’m not sure whet her t hat ’s useful or not .
m e013 [ %−] : What [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ s^ bd^ df^ rt ] : Maybe [ disfm arker] m aybe it ’s no big deal .
fe041 [ s^ cs] : Maybe we just do it and see what happens .
m e013 [ s] : I guess t he point was t o t ry [ disfm arker] again , t o t ry t o
collect m ore inform at ion t hat could be useful lat er for [ disfm arker] for
t he UI st uff .
fe041 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s sort of Landay supplying it
m e013 [ s] : so t hat Landay ’s st uff can be easier t o do .
fe041 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : So it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] Right now he ’s g
operat ing from zero ,
fe041 [ s^ 2] : Not hing .
m e013 [ s^ df.%−−] : and so even if we didn’t get it done from UW , it
seem s like t hat would [ disfm arker] could st ill [ disfm arker] You shou
fe041 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : I m ean , at least t ry it .
fe016 [ s] : I t hink it ’d be useful t o have a sm all am ount of it just as a
proof of concept .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ %−] : It will [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and t hey seem t o [ pause] not be able t o
giv e enough of t hem away ,
fe016 [ s^ e] : You know , what you can do wit h t hings .
fe041 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : so we could probably get m ore as well .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s^ cs] : Yeah . But not [ disfm arker] not t o rely on t hem for
[ pause] basic m odeling .

fe041 [ s^ na] : That ’s t rue .
fe041 [ s] : So if it [ disfm arker] if it seem s t o be really useful t o you
guy s , we could probably get a donat ion t o m e .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ no] : Yeah , I ’m not sure .
m e011 [ s] : I t hink it it [ disfm arker] it will again depend on Landay ,
m e011 [ s] : and if he has a st udent who ’s int erest ed ,
m e011 [ s] : and how m uch infrast ruct ure we ’ll need .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , if it ’s easy , we can just do it .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Um , but if it requires a lot of our t im e , we probably won’t
do it .
fe041 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : I guess a lot of t he st uff we ’re doing now really is pilot
m e013 [ s^ e] : in one sense or anot her .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . Yeah , we have t o sort of figure out what
we ’re gonna do .
m e013 [ s^ e] : And so we t ry it out and see how it works .
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right .
fe041 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : I just wouldn’t base any of t he m odeling on having t hose
.
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Right . I ag I t hink I agree wit h t hat .
fe041 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe016 [ %−] : It ’s just [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe041 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : I t hink , t hough , t he im port ance m arking is a [ pause]
good idea , t hough .
m e011 [ s^ e] : That if [ disfm arker] if people have som et hing in front of
t hem [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ ba^ na] : I ’d be sort of cool .
fe016 [ s.%−] : I m ean , it would [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−] : That w shouldn’t be hard for [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : Do it on pilot s or lapt ops or som et hing .
m e011 [ s^ j:s^ cs] : OK , if som et hing ’s im port ant everyone clap .
fe041 [ fg|s^ t ^ t c] : OK . So CrossPads , we ’re just gonna t ry it and see
what happens .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . Um , I t hink t hat ’s right .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe041 [ s^ bk.%] : OK .
fe041 [ s^ t ^ t c.%−−] : The not e − t aking [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ s] : So , I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat t his is gonna be useful .

fe041 [ s] : So if we record dat a I will definit ely ask for it .
fe041 [ s^ cs:qy] : So , I j I t hink we should just say t his is not
[ disfm arker] we don’t want t o put any ext ra burden on people , but if
t hey happen t o generat e m inut es , could [ disfm arker] could t hey send
it t o us ?
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : Oh , OK . That ’s fine .
m e011 [ s^ na] : Absolut ely .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn043 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe041 [ %−] : And t hen [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah . What I was gonna say is t hat I don’t want t o ask
people t o do som et hing t hey wouldn’t norm ally do in a m eet ing .
m e011 [ s] : It ’s ver I just want t o keep away from t he art ificialit y .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : But I t hink it [ pause] definit ely
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : if t hey exist .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : And t hen Jane ’s idea of sum m arizat ion aft erward I
t hink is not a bad one .
m e011 [ fh] : Um ,
m e011 [ s] : picking out [ disfm arker] basically t o let you pick out
keywords ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : um , and , uh , const ruct queries .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : So who [ disfm arker] who does t his sum m arizat ion ?
fe008 [ s^ bk|s.%−] : Yeah , I ’m t hinking t hat [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : People in t he m eet ing .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : You know , just at [ disfm arker] at t he end of t he m eet ing ,
before you go ,
fe008 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe016 [ s^ 2] : Wit hout hearing each ot her t hough , probably .
m e011 [ s^ e] : go around t he t able .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e022 [ s^ cs] : Or even just have one or t wo people st ay behind .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Ugh .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s] : People wit h radio m ikes can go int o separat e room s and
cont inue recording wit hout hearing each ot her .
m e025 [ s^ ba] : That ’s t he nice t hing .
fe016 [ s^ cs^ j] : Well , t hen you should t ry t hem a few weeks lat er
fe008 [ s^ ba] : How fascinat ing .
fe016 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ 2^ bu^ d^ rt ] : And see [ disfm arker] score t hem ?

fe016 [ s] : They have all t hese m em ory experim ent s about how lit t le
y ou act ually ret ain
m e025 [ s^ j^ na] : That ’s right .
m e025 [ s^ ba] : Well , t hat ’s t he int erest ing t hing , t hough .
fe016 [ qy .%−] : and wasn’t [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s] : If we do [ disfm arker] if we collect four different sum m aries ,
y ou know , we ’re gonna get all t his weird dat a about how people
perceiv e t hings different ly .
m e011 [ b.%] : Oh .
m e011 [ b.%] : Hm m .
m e025 [ s] : It ’s like [ com m ent ] t his is not what we m eant t o research .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right , right .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That could be very int erest ing .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe041 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e022 [ b.%] : Hm m .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−] : Ru
fe041 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but again , like t he CrossPads , I don’t
t hink I would base a lot of st uff on it ,
m e011 [ %−−] : I d
m e011 [ fg|s] : yeah , I don’t know how you would do it , t hough .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe041 [ s^ df] : because I t hink [ disfm arker] I know when I see t he
[ disfm arker] t he clock com ing near t he end of t he m eet ing , I ’m like
inching t owards t he door .
m e011 [ s^ 2.%−] : Running t o [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e011 [ %] : fff !
fe041 [ fh] : So ,
m e025 [ b] : Hm m .
fe041 [ s] : you ’re probably not gonna get [ pause] a lot of people
want ing t o do t his .
fe008 [ s.%−] : Well , I t hink if [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ cs^ rt ] : Maybe e Is em ail easier ?
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , I [ disfm arker] when you first said do [ disfm arker]
do it , um , spoken , what I was t hinking is , oh t hen people have t o
com e up
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : and y ou have t o hook t hem up t o t he recorder .
m e011 [ s] : So , if t hey ’re already here I t hink t hat ’s good ,
m e011 [ s] : but if t hey ’re not already here for [ disfm arker] I ’d rat her
do em ail .
fe041 [ b] : Right .

fe008 [ fg|s] : Yeah , I ’d just t ry [ disfm arker] Well , however t he least
int rusive and [ disfm arker] and quickest way is ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : I ’m m uch fast er t yping t han anyt hing else .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : and t h and closest t o t he m eet ing t im e t oo ,
fe008 [ s^ df] : cuz people will st art t o forget it as soon as t hey l leave .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe041 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah . I t hink t hat [ disfm arker] I t hink doing it orally at
t he end of t he m eet ing is t he best t im e .
m e011 [ s^ bd^ no] : I don’t know .
m e011 [ s^ 2.%−] : At [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe041 [ s.%−−] : I just don’t [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ s^ df] : because t hey ’re kind of a capt ive audience .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe041 [ s^ e] : Once t hey leave ,
fe041 [ s^ e] : you know , forget it .
fe041 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker] but i
m e011 [ fg|s^ na:s] : Yeah , read t he digit s ,
m e011 [ s^ na:s] : do t he sum m ary .
fe041 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe041 [ s] : But , uh , I don’t t hink t hat t hey ’ll necessarily [ disfm arker]
y ou ’ll [ disfm arker] you ’ll get m any people willing t o st ay .
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ %−] : w
fe041 [ s^ bd.%−−] : But , you know , if y ou get even one [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−] : I would s
m e013 [ s] : Well , I t hink it ’s like t he not e − t aking t hing ,
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : t hat [ disfm arker] t hat y t hat y ou can’t [ disfm arker]
cert ainly can’t require it
m e013 [ s^ e] : or people aren’t gonna want t o do t his .
m e013 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but if t here ’s som e cases where t hey will ,
t hen it would be helpful .
fe008 [ qh^ cs] : And I ’m also wondering , couldn’t t hat be included in
t he dat a sam ple
m e022 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s^ df] : so t hat you could increase t he num you know , t he
words t hat are , uh , recognized by a part icular individual ?
fe008 [ s^ df^ e.%−−] : If you could include t he person ’s m eet ing st uff
and also t he person ’s sum m ary st uff , m aybe t hat would be uh ,
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ e] : an ad addit ion t o t heir dat abase .
m e025 [ s^ ba^ na] : It ’s kind of nice .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s^ e] : Under t he sam e acoust ic circum st ance ,

fe008 [ s^ df] : cuz if t hey just walk nex t door wit h t heir set − up ,
not hing ’s changed ,
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe008 [ %−−] : just [ disfm arker]
m e022 [ s^ t ^ t c] : So I have a quest ion about queries ,
m e011 [ s^ t 3] : God , t hat ’s bugging m e .
m e022 [ s.%−] : which is , um ,
fe008 [ %−] : You t urn [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Can we t urn t hat light off ?
m e022 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.%−] : If [ disfm arker] can we t urn t hat just [ disfm arker] t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat let [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : Uh , let t he record show t he light is flickering .
m e013 [ s^ 2] : The fl t he fluorescent light is flickering .
m e022 [ s^ no.%] : I don’t know .
fe041 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa|%−] : Yeah , t here ’s a [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : Oh , it is [ disfm arker] it is like [ disfm arker] OK .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Very annoying .

m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e022 [ fg] : So ,
m e011 [ s] : I t hought it was t he project or for a m om ent .
m e011 [ s:qw] : It was like , " what ’s going on ? "
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e022 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ^ t ] : t he quest ion I had about queries was , um ,
so what we ’re planning t o do is hav e people look at t he sum m aries
and t hen generat e queries ?
m e011 [ s] : We [ disfm arker] we ’ve just been t alking , how do we
generat e queries ?
m e022 [ qy ^ e.%−] : Are [ disfm arker] are we gonna t ry and o
m e022 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : And so t hat was one suggest ion .

m e022 [ s.%−] : Well , I m ean ,
m e022 [ qy] : so , t he quest ion I had is is have we given any t hought t o
how we would generat e queries aut om at ically given a sum m ary ?
m e022 [ s] : I m ean , I t hink t hat ’s a whole research t opic un unt o it self
,
m e013 [ b] : Mm m .
m e022 [ s^ bd] : so t hat it m ay not be a feasible t hing .
m e022 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
m e022 [ %−] : n
m e025 [ s^ t 3] : Hello .
m e025 [ s^ t 3] : Dan here .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ qy ] : Shouldn’t Landay and his group be in charge of figuring

fe016 [ s] : I m ean , t his is an issue t hat goes a lit t le bit beyond where
[ pause] we are right now .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : They ’re t he expert
m e025 [ s^ t 3] : Mari ?

fe041 [ h|qw] : Um , [ v ocalsound] what ’s our schedule ?
m e013 [ s] : Well , you st ill want ed t o t alk wit h Liz .
fe041 [ s^ t 1] : Let ’s see ,
fe041 [ s.%−−] : y ou and I need dis Uh ,

fe041 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe041 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so t hat was t he prosody t hing .
fe016 [ s^ no] : We − [ vocalsound] I don’t rem em ber it .
fe041 [ fh|s^ co.%−−] : Um , we need t o finish t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
fe041 [ s] : It ’s already four − fift een .
fe016 [ s] : I hav e like no recall m em ory .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe041 [ s^ bsc] : Uh , aft er .
fe041 [ s^ cs] : We need t o [ pause] finish t his discussion , and you

m e011 [ qw] : And what ?
m e013 [ s] : I ’m at your disposal .
fe041 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So , up t o you .

fe041 [ h|qw] : Um , what [ disfm arker] what ’s t he plan for t his
discussion ?
fe041 [ s.%−] : We should [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ h|s] : Um , I t hink we should be able t o wind up in anot her half

m e011 [ s^ aap|s^ aa] : At least . Yeah .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : you t hink ?
m e011 [ s^ bu^ e] : m i Even if t hat m uch ?
fe041 [ s] : Uh , less .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Less .
fe041 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qw^ br] : Less ?
fe041 [ s.%−] : So , I t hink [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ t 3] : It ’s int erest ing t hat he ’s got , like , [ pause] t his

m e013 [ s] : Well , I m ean , we st ill hav en’t t alked about t he act ion
it em s from here and so on .
fe041 [ s^ 2.%−−] : Act ion [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe041 [ s^ aa] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
fe041 [ fh] : So ,
fe016 [ s^ e^ t 3] : yet it ’s separat e .
m e013 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ qh^ cs] : e e why don’t you say five − t hirt y ?
m e025 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , five − t hirt y .
fe041 [ %−] : I don’t [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t hat OK ?
fe041 [ s^ bd] : We ’ll probably hit horrible t raffic .

m e025 [ s^ bk^ t 3] : OK .
m e025 [ s^ ft ^ t 3|s^ t 3] : h Thanks , bye .
fe041 [ s] : That ’s not a lot of t im e ,

fe041 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ t ^ t c] : Well , in answer t o " is it Landay ’s problem ? " ,
m e011 [ s] : um , he doesn’t hav e a st udent who ’s int erest ed right now
in doing any t hing .
m e011 [ s] : So he has very lit t le m anpower .
m e011 [ s] : Um , t here ’s very lit t le allocat ed for him
m e011 [ s] : and also he ’s pret t y focused on user int erface .
m e011 [ s] : So I don’t t hink he want s t o do inform at ion ret rieval ,
m e011 [ s] : query generat ion , t hat sort of st uff .
m e013 [ fg|s^ arp] : Yeah , well t here ’s gonna be t hese st udent

m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , ye
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e013 [ s.%−] : If he doesn’t know anyt hing about t he area , and
[ disfm arker] t he people are t alking about and [ disfm arker] and , uh
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ nd] : But t he people will just look at t he sum m aries or t he
m inut es and re and sort of back − generat e t he queries .
fe016 [ s] : That ’s what I ’m worried about .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : So you m ight as well just give him t he sum m aries .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ am ] : Maybe .
m e022 [ s^ no] : Well , I ’m not sure [ disfm arker] I ’m not sure t hat ’s a
solv ed problem .
m e011 [ s.%−] : y Well , but I t hink [ disfm arker]
m e022 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e022 [ s.%−−] : Of how t o [ disfm arker] how t o generat e queries from a
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ qw.%−−] : How t o do t his
m e011 [ %−] : I , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ 2] : from t he sum m ary .
m e022 [ s] : That was sort of what m y [ pause] quest ion was [ pause]
aim ed t owards .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : So what you want t o h t o do is , people who were t here ,
who lat er see , uh , m inut es and s put in sum m ary form , which is not
gonna be at t he sam e t im e as t he m eet ing . There ’s no way t hat can
happen . Are we gonna lat er go over it
fe041 [ b.%] : Hm m .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s] : and , like , m ake up som e st uff t o which t hese not es would
be an answer ,
fe016 [ s^ e] : or [ disfm arker] or a deeper [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : Or [ disfm arker] or just a m em ory refresher .
fe016 [ %−−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]

fe016 [ s] : But t hat ’s done off [ disfm arker] t hey have t o do t hat off −
line .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yep . I agree .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : I ’m also wondering if we could ask t he [ disfm arker] t he
people a [ disfm arker] a quest ion
fe016 [ %−] : You
fe008 [ s^ cs^ e:qw] : which would be " what was t he m ost int erest ing
t hing y ou got out of t his m eet ing ? "
fe008 [ s^ df] : Becau − in t erm s of like inform at iveness ,
fe016 [ s^ ba] : That ’s a good one .
fe008 [ s^ df] : it m ight be , you know , t hat t he sum m ary would
[ disfm arker] would not in even include what t he person t hought was
t he m ost int erest ing fact .
m e013 [ s] : I would t hink t hat would be t he m ost likely t hing .
fe016 [ s^ j] : Dan doesn’t know what sex he is .
m e025 [ s^ j^ na] : Yeah , really .
fe041 [ s^ na] : But act ually I would say t hat ’s a bet t er t hing t o ask
t han have t hem sum m arize t he m eet ing .
fe008 [ s^ df^ na] : I t hink you get t wo different t ypes of inform at ion .
fe041 [ s^ m .%−−] : You get t wo [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , t hat ’s t rue .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ df] : Because you get , like , t he general st ruct ure of
im port ant point s and what t he [ disfm arker] what t he m eet ing was
about .
m e013 [ s^ t 3] : Hey .
fe016 [ %−] : Ah
m e013 [ s^ aa^ t 3] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ t 3] : We ’re st ill here .
fe008 [ s] : So you get t he general st ruct ure , t he im port ant point s of
what t he m eet ing was about [ pause] wit h t he sum m ary .
fe008 [ qh] : But wit h t he " what ’s t he m ost int erest ing t hing you
learned ? " [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : Uh , so t he fact t hat , uh , I know t hat Transcriber uses
Snack is som et hing t hat I t hought was int erest ing
fe016 [ s^ t 3] : Going t o see t he kids .
m e025 [ s^ t 3] : You [ disfm arker] you can keep it on .
fe008 [ s] : and t hat [ disfm arker] and t hat Dan worked on [ disfm arker]
on t hat .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So I t hought t hat was really [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ f] : y ou know .
fe008 [ s] : So , I m ean , you could ge pick up som e of t he m icro it em s
t hat wouldn’t even occur as m ajor headings
fe041 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ e] : but could be very inform at ive .
fe041 [ s^ aa|s^ ba^ na] : Yeah , t hat ’s act ually a really good idea .

fe008 [ s^ df^ e] : I t hink it wouldn’t be t oo , uh , uh , cost − int ensiv e
eit her .
fe008 [ s] : You know , I m ean , it ’s like som et hing som eone can do
pret t y easily on t he spur of t he m om ent .
fn043 [ qr] : Are you t hinking about just asking one part icipant or all of

m e011 [ s] : As m any are willing t o do it .
fn043 [ s^ cs] : Make it a volunt ary t hing ,
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s^ df|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Cuz you ’ll get [ disfm arker] cuz you ’ll get
v ery different answers from every body , right ?
fn043 [ %−] : and t hen [ disfm arker]
fn043 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah . That ’s why I was wondering .
m e025 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ cs.%−−] : Well , m aybe one t hing we could do is for t he
m eet ings we ’v e already done [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bd] : I m ean , I [ disfm arker] we didn’t t ake m inut es and we
don’t hav e sum m aries .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : But , uh , people could , like , list en t o t hem a lit t le bit
and [ pause] generat e som e queries .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Of course Jane doesn’t need t o .
m e011 [ s] : I ’m sure you have t hat m eet ing m em orized by now .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe041 [ s:qw] : But act ually it would be an easy t hing t o just go around
t he room and say [ pause] what was t he m ost int erest ing t hing you

m e011 [ b] : Mm m .
fe008 [ b.%] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b.%] : Yeah .
fe041 [ s^ e] : for t hose pe people willing t o st ay .
fe008 [ s^ na.%−−] : And t hat [ disfm arker] I t hink it would pick up t he
m icro − st ruct ure , t he [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : som e [ disfm arker] som e of t he lit t le t hings t hat would be

fe041 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and t hat m ight be som et hing people are
willing t o st ay for .
m e013 [ s^ no.%−] : Boy , I [ disfm arker] I don’t know how we get at t his
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That would be int erest ing .
m e011 [ s^ ng] : Or want t o get up and leave .
fn043 [ fg|s] : Yeah , but when you go around t he room you m ight just
get t he effect t hat som ebody says som et hing
fn043 [ s:s^ aa|s^ na] : and t hen you go around t he room and t hey say
" yeah , m e t oo , I agree . "
m e011 [ s^ 2:s] : Me t oo , m e t oo , m e t oo .

m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s|qy ^ d^ g] : On t he ot her hand people m ight t ry and com e up
wit h different ones , right ?
fe041 [ s^ ba] : That ’s fine .
fn043 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−] : Well [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s:s] : They m ight say " oh , I was gonna say t hat one
m e011 [ %−] : Well ,
m e025 [ s^ e:s] : but now I hav e t o t hink of som et hing else " .
m e011 [ s] : y ou have t he ot her t hing , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat t hey know

m e011 [ s^ e] : We ’ll [ disfm arker] I m ean , we ’ll [ disfm arker] we ’ll be

m e011 [ s^ e] : so t ry t o pick t hings t hat ot her people didn’t say .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s gonna t ake som e t hought .
m e013 [ %−−] : I m ean ,
m e013 [ s] : It seem ed [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] The kind of , uh ,
int erest t hat I had in t his t hing init ially was , uh , t hat i basically t he

m e013 [ s] : and y ou want t o pick up som et hing from t his m eet ing

m e025 [ b] : Mm m .
fe041 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ e.%−−] : rat her t han t he [ disfm arker]

m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fn043 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , in fact if [ disfm arker] if it was really m ajor , if it ’s
t he t hing t hat really st uck in your head , t hen you m ight not need t o
go back and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and check on it even .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s t hat you ’re t rying t o find
[ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] You ’re [ disfm arker] you ’ve now [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : You weren’t int erest ed [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s^ e:s] : I ’m m ore of an acoust ics person " .
m e025 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ e:qw] : But [ disfm arker] but t hr t hree m ont hs from now if for

[ disfm arker] what was t hat part t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat , uh , Mari was saying ? "

m e011 [ fg|s.%−:s.%−] : Yeah , like Jim Bass says " add a few lines on

fe041 [ %−] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe041 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen I ’m t rying t o fi I m ean , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s
when I look [ disfm arker] in general when I look t hings up m ost , is
when it ’s som et hing t hat [ vocalsound] didn’t really st ick in m y head
t he first t im e around
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] but for som e [ com m ent ] new reason I ’m
[ disfm arker] I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m int erest ed in [ disfm arker] in
[ disfm arker] in t he old st uff .
m e011 [ s] : But t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s gonna be very hard t o

m e013 [ s^ no] : So , I don’t [ disfm arker] I don’t know .
fe041 [ s^ na] : Well , I [ disfm arker] That ’s hard t o generat e
m e022 [ %−] : Do we [ disfm arker]
fn043 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe041 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and I t hink t hat ’s half of what i I would use

fe041 [ s:s] : But I also a lot of t im es um , m ake [ disfm arker] you know ,
t hink t o m y self " t his is int erest ing ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe041 [ s^ e:s] : I ’v e got t a com e back and follow up on it " .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe041 [ s] : So , t hings t hat I t hink are int erest ing , um , I would be , uh ,
want ing t o do a query about .
fe041 [ s] : And also , I like t he idea of going around t he room ,
fe041 [ s^ df] : because if som ebody else t hought som et hing was
int erest ing , I ’d kind of want t o know about it
fe041 [ s^ df^ e] : and t hen I ’d want t o follow up on it .
m e025 [ b.%] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : Yeah . That [ disfm arker] t hat m ight get at som e
of what I was [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I was concerned about , uh , being int erest ed in
som et hing lat er t hat w uh , I didn’t consider t o be im port ant t he first
t im e ,
m e013 [ s] : which for m e is act ually t he dom inant t hing ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : because if I t hought it was really im port ant it t ends t o

m e013 [ s] : but som e new [ pause] t ask com es along t hat m akes m e
want t o look up .
m e011 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]

m e011 [ s] : But what ’s int erest ing t o m e m ay not b have been
int erest ing t o y ou .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ cs] : Yeah . So having m ult iple people m ight get at
som e of t hat .
m e011 [ s.%−] : By [ disfm arker] so by going around [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah , I [ disfm arker] I t hink [ pause] you can’t get at all

m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : W we just need t o st art som ewhere .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , and t his is a st art ing point .
m e022 [ qh] : The quest ion [ disfm arker] t he quest ion t hen is h h how

fe008 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e022 [ s^ e] : and , you know , m aybe t ha som et hing else is im port ant
lat er ?
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e022 [ s] : I m ean , uh , t hat ’s , I guess , a quest ion for you guys .
m e022 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s:s] : Well , and [ disfm arker] and one t hing , we [ disfm arker] we
’re say ing " im port ant " and we ’re saying " int erest ing " .
fe008 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and t hose [ disfm arker] t hose can be t wo

m e022 [ s^ aa] : Uh , yeah , yeah .
m e022 [ s^ aa] : Sure , sure .
fe041 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e022 [ s.%−−] : But I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I guess t hat ’s t he
quest ion , really , is t hat [ disfm arker] I m ean ,
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ %−] : W
m e022 [ qy] : does building queries based on what ’s im port ant now
int roduce an irrev ersible bias on being able t o do what Morgan want s
t o do lat er ?
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK , good .
m e013 [ s] : Well , irreversible .
m e022 [ %−] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I m ean , I guess what I
what I [ disfm arker] I keep com ing back t o in m y own m ind is t hat , um ,
t he soonest we can do it , we need t o get up som e kind of syst em
m e022 [ b] : Right .

m e013 [ s] : so t hat people who ’ve been involved in t he m eet ing can
go back lat er ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : ev en if it ’s a poor syst em in som e ways ,
m e013 [ s] : and , uh [ disfm arker] and ask t he quest ions t hat t hey
act ually want t o know .
m e013 [ s] : If [ disfm arker] you know , if [ disfm arker] uh , as soon as we
can get t hat going at any kind of level , t hen I t hink we ’ll have a m uch

fe041 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe041 [ s^ ba|s] : Great . That solves t hat problem .

fe041 [ fg|s^ t ] : OK . I t hink t hat ’s good enou t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat
’s pret t y m uch all I can t hink of .
fe008 [ qy ] : Can I ask , uh , one t hing ?
fe008 [ s] : It relat es t o dat a [ disfm arker] dat a collect ion
fe008 [ s.%−−] : and I [ disfm arker] and I ’d [ disfm arker] and we
m ent ioned earlier t oday , t his quest ion of [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ fh] : um , so ,
fe008 [ s] : um , I s I know t hat from [ disfm arker] wit h t he near − field
m ikes som e of t he problem s t hat com e wit h overlapping speech , uh ,
are lessened .
fe008 [ qr^ cs] : But I wonder if [ disfm arker] Uh , is t hat sufficient or
should we consider m aybe get t ing som e dat a gat hered in such a way
t hat , um , u w we would c uh , p have a m eet ing wit h less overlap t han
would ot herwise be t he case ?
fe008 [ s] : So eit her by rules of part icipat ion , or what ever .
fe041 [ s^ bk] : Oh , yeah .
fe008 [ s] : Now , I m ean , you know , it ’s t rue ,
fe008 [ s] : I m ean , we were discussing t his earlier ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : t hat depending on t he t ask [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : so if you ’ve got som eone giving a report you ’re not gonna
have as m uch overlap .
m e022 [ s^ t 1] : Adam !
fe008 [ fh] : But , um ,

fe008 [ s] : i i uh , so we ’re gonna have s y ou know , non − overlapping
sam ples any way .
fe008 [ qr] : But , um , in a m eet ing which would ot herwise be highly
ov erlapping , is t he near − field m ike enough or should we hav e som e
rules of part icipat ion for som e of our sam ples t o lessen t he overlap ?
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
m e025 [ s^ t 1.%] : t urn off
fe041 [ s] : I don’t t hink we should have rules of part icipat ion ,
fe041 [ s^ cs] : but I t hink we should t ry t o [ pause] get a variet y of
m eet ings .
fe041 [ s] : That ’s som et hing t hat if we get t he [ disfm arker] t he
m eet ing st uff going at UW , t hat I probably can do m ore t han you guys
,
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe041 [ s^ df] : cuz you guys are probably m ost ly going t o get ICSI
people here .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe041 [ s] : But we can get anybody in EE , uh , over [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and possibly also som e CS people , uh ,
ov er at UW .
fe041 [ s] : So , I t hink t hat [ disfm arker] t hat t here ’s a good chance we
could get m ore variet y .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ df.%−] : Just want t o be sure t here ’s enough dat a t o
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : OK , good .
fe016 [ s] : They ’re st ill gonna overlap ,
fe041 [ fh] : Um ,
fe016 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] Mark and ot hers have said t hat t here ’s
quit e a lot of found dat a [ com m ent ] from t he discourse com m unit y
t hat has t his charact erist ic
fe016 [ s.%−−] : and also t he polit ical [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : Y you know , anyt hing t hat was t elevised for a t hird part y
has t he charact erist ic of not very m uch overlap .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : Wasn − but w I t hink we were saying before also t hat t he
nat ural language group here had less overlap .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe041 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s] : So it also depends on t he st yle of t he group of people .
fe016 [ s] : Like t he , um , dom inance relat ions of t he people in t he
m eet ing .
fe041 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : On t he t ask , and t he t ask .

fe008 [ %−] : It ’s just [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I just want ed t o [ disfm arker] uh ,
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ df] : because you know , it is t rue people can m odify t he
am ount of overlap t hat t hey do if [ disfm arker] if t hey ’re asked t o .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bd] : Not [ disfm arker] not ent irely m odify it ,
fe008 [ s^ df] : but lessen it if [ disfm arker] if it ’s desired .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : But if [ disfm arker] if t hat ’s sufficient dat a [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I just want ed t o be sure t hat we will not be having a lot of
dat a which can’t be processed .
fe041 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe041 [ s] : So I ’m just writ ing here , we ’re not gonna t ry t o specify
rules of int eract ion
fe041 [ s] : but we ’re gonna t ry t o get m ore variet y by i using different
[ pause] groups of people
fe008 [ s] : Tim e .
fe041 [ s^ e^ rt ] : and different sizes .
fe008 [ s^ bk|s] : Fine . And I [ disfm arker] you know , I [ disfm arker] I
know t hat t he near f near − field m ikes will t ake care of also t he
problem s t o s t o a cert ain degree .
fe041 [ %−] : e e
fe041 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ df] : I just want ed t o be sure .
fe041 [ s] : And t hen t he ot her t hing m ight be , um , uh , t echnical
v ersus adm inist rat ive .
fe041 [ s^ df] : Cuz if I recorded som e adm inist rat ive m eet ings t hen t hat
m ay have less overlap ,
fe041 [ s^ df] : because you m ight have m ore overlap when you ’re
doing som et hing t echnical and disagreeing or what ever .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well , I [ disfm arker] just as [ disfm arker] as [ disfm arker]
as a cont ribut ary [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : eh , so I [ disfm arker] I know t hat in l in legal deposit ions
people are pr are prevent ed from ov erlapping .
fe008 [ s] : They ’ll just say , you know [ disfm arker] you know , " wait t ill
each person is finished before you say som et hing " .
fe008 [ s] : So it is possible t o lessen if we want ed t o .
fe008 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but t hese ot her fact ors are fine .
fe008 [ s] : I just want ed t o raise t he issue .
fe041 [ s.%−−] : Well , t he reason why I didn’t want t o is be why I
personally didn’t want t o [ com m ent ] is because I want ed it t o be
[ pause] as , uh , unint rusive as possi
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

fe008 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
fe041 [ s^ e] : as y ou could be wit h t hese t hings hanging on you .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Oh , y eah .
fe008 [ s^ na] : Yeah , I t hink t hat ’s always desired .
fe008 [ s] : I just want t o be sure we don’t [ disfm arker] t hat we ’re able
t o process , i u uh , you know , as m uch dat a as we can .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy ] : Did t hey discuss any of t hat in t he [ disfm arker] t he

m e013 [ qw.%−] : What [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qw.%−] : What [ disfm arker] what do t hey [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : And t here was a big division ,
fe016 [ s] : so Liberm an and ot hers [ pause] were int erest ed in a lot of

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : So t here ’s lot s of recordings t hat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : They ’re not close − t alk m ike ,
fe016 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and t here ’s lot s of t elevision , you know ,
st uff on , um , polit ical debat es and t hings like t hat ,
fe016 [ s] : congre congressional hearings .
fe016 [ s] : Boring st uff like t hat .
fe016 [ fh] : Um ,
fe016 [ s.%−−] : and t hen t he CMU folks and I were sort of on t he ot her

fe016 [ s^ df] : cuz t hey had collect ed a lot of m eet ings t hat were sort
of like t his
fe016 [ s] : and said t hat t hose are not hing like t hese m eet ings .
fe016 [ s] : Um , so t here ’re really t wo different kinds of dat a .
fe016 [ s] : And , I guess we just left it as [ disfm arker] @ @ [ com m ent ]
t hat [ pause] if t here ’s found dat a t hat can be t ransform ed for use in

fe016 [ s^ ba^ fe] : Rrrh !

fn043 [ b] : Hm m .
m e011 [ fg] : So , um ,
fe016 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker]

m e011 [ s.%−−] : I really liked t he idea of [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : what I t hought was int erest ing was t he com binat ion of t he
CrossPad and t he speech .
m e011 [ s] : Especially , um , t he int eract ion of t hem rat her t han just
not e − t aking .
m e011 [ qh] : So , can you [ pause] det erm ine t he int erest ing point s by
who ’s writ ing ?
m e011 [ qh^ e] : Can you do special gest ures and so on t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat have , uh , special m eaning t o t he corpora ?
m e011 [ s] : I really liked t hat .
fe008 [ s] : Well , I [ disfm arker] I just realized t here ’s anot her cat egory
of int erest ing t hings
fe008 [ s.%−−] : which is t hat , um ,
fe008 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I found t his discussion very , uh , i t his
[ disfm arker] t his quest ion of how you get at queries really int erest ing .
fe008 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and t he [ disfm arker] and I [ disfm arker]
and t he fact t hat it ’s sort of , uh , nebulous , what [ disfm arker] what
t hat [ disfm arker] what kind of query it would be
fe008 [ s^ df] : because it depends on what your purpose is .
fe008 [ s] : So I act ually found t hat whole process of [ disfm arker] of
t ry ing t o t hink of what t hat would involv e t o be int erest ing .
fe008 [ s] : But t hat ’s not really a specific fact .
fe008 [ s] : I just sort of t hought we [ disfm arker] we went around a nice
discussion of t he fact ors involved t here ,
fe008 [ s] : which I t hought was wort hwhile .
m e025 [ s] : I had a real revelat ion about t aking pict ures .
m e025 [ s^ no] : I don’t know why
m e025 [ s] : I didn’t do t his before and I regret it .

fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s.%−−] : Not t hat I [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s^ ng] : The boards aren’t really relat ed t o t his m eet ing .
m e025 [ s^ df] : I m ean , I will t ake pict ures of t hem ,
m e025 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s a good point .
fe041 [ s] : They ’re relat ed t o t his m orning ’s m eet ing .
m e025 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ 2|s^ na] : To t he pre previous m eet ing . That ’s right .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e025 [ s] : Well , t hat ’s why I ’ll t ake pict ures of t hem , t hen .
m e022 [ s] : I ’m gonna pass

m e025 [ s^ m ] : For t he m om ent .
fe016 [ s] : Pass .
fe041 [ s] : I t hink [ disfm arker] I t hink " pass " is socially accept able .
fe041 [ s.%−−] : But I will say [ disfm arker] uh , I will act ually [ disfm arker]
fe041 [ s] : uh , a spin on different [ disfm arker] slight ly different spin on
what y ou said ,
fe041 [ s.%−−] : t his issue of , uh , realizing t hat we could t ake m inut es ,
fe041 [ s] : and t hat act ually m ay be a goal .
fe041 [ s] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat m ay be kind of t he t est
[ disfm arker] in a sense , t est dat a ,
fe041 [ s^ e] : uh , t he [ disfm arker] t he t em plat e of what we want t o
t est against , generat ing a sum m ary .
fe041 [ s] : So t hat ’s an int erest ing new t wist on what we can do wit h
t his dat a .
fn043 [ s^ na] : I agree wit h Jane and Eric .
fn043 [ s] : I t hink t he quest ion of how t o generat e queries
aut om at ically was t he m ost int erest ing quest ion t hat cam e up ,
fn043 [ s] : and it ’s som et hing t hat , as you said , is a whole research
t opic in it self ,
fn043 [ s] : so I don’t t hink we ’ll be able t o do anyt hing on it
fn043 [ s^ df] : because we don’t have funding on it , uh , in t his project
.
fn043 [ fh|s] : But , um , [ vocalsound] it ’s definit ely som et hing I would
