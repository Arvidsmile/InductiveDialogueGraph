m e013 [ z] : That are [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ z] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ z] : Yeah .
m n007 [ z] : um .
m n007 [ z] : Yeah .
m n007 [ z] : Yeah , I ’m sorry for t he t able ,
m n007 [ z] : but as it grows in size , uh , it .
m e013 [ z] : Uh , so for t h t he last colum n we use our im aginat ion .
m e013 [ z] : OK .
fn002 [ z] : Ah , yeah .
m e013 [ z] : Ah .
m n007 [ z] : Uh , y eah .

m e006 [ z] : Yeah .
m e013 [ z] : Yeah .
m e006 [ z] : Chop !
m e013 [ z] : When you get older you have t hese different perspect ives .
m n007 [ z] : So
m e013 [ z] : I m ean , lowering t he word hour rat e is fine , but having big
font !
m n007 [ z] : Next t im e we will put colors or som et hing .
m e013 [ z] : That ’s what ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ z] : Yeah . It ’s m ost ly big font .
m n007 [ z] : Uh .
m e013 [ fg] : OK .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fg|s] : OK , s so t here is kind of sum m ary of what has been

m e013 [ s^ co] : Go ahead .
m n007 [ s] : It ’s t his .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh . OK .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Sum m ary of experim ent s since , well , since last week
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : and also since t he [ disfm arker] we ’ve st art ed t o run
[ disfm arker] work on t his .

m n007 [ fh|s] : Um . [ pause] So since last week we ’ve st art ed t o fill t he
colum n wit h um [ v ocalsound] uh feat ures w wit h net s t rained on PLP
wit h on − line norm alizat ion
m n007 [ s] : but wit h delt a also ,
m n007 [ s.%−−] : because t he colum n was not com plet ely [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m . Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : well , it ’s st ill not com plet ely filled ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : but [ pause] we have m ore result s t o com pare wit h
net work using wit hout PLP
m n007 [ s] : and [ pause] finally , hhh , [ com m ent ] um [ pause] ehhh
[ com m ent ] PL − uh delt a seem s very im port ant .
m n007 [ fh|s^ no] : Uh [ pause] I don’t know .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : If you t ake um , let ’s say , anyway Aurora − t wo − B ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : so , t he next [ disfm arker] t t he second , uh , part of t he
t able ,
m e013 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : uh [ pause] when we use t he large t raining set using
French , Spanish , and English , y ou have one hundred and six wit hout
delt a
m n007 [ s] : and eight y − nine wit h t he delt a .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : a And again all of t hese num bers are wit h a hundred
percent being , uh , t he baseline perform ance ,
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ s^ na] : on t he baseline , yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : but wit h a m el cepst ra syst em going st raight int o t he
HTK ?
m n007 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Yes .
m n007 [ s] : So now we see t hat t he gap bet ween t he different t raining
set is m uch [ pause] uh uh m uch sm aller
m e006 [ s] : It ’s out of t he way .
m n007 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : But , act ually , um , for English t raining on TIMIT is st ill
bet t er t han t he ot her languages .
m n007 [ %−−] : And
m n007 [ fh] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n007 [ b] : Mm m , [ pause] Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : And f also for It alian , act ually .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : If you t ake t he second set of experim ent for It alian ,
m n007 [ s] : so , t he m ism at ched condit ion ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : um [ pause] when we use t he t raining on TIMIT
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : so , it ’s m ult i − English ,

m n007 [ s] : we have a ninet y − one num ber ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : and t raining wit h ot her languages is a lit t le bit worse .
m e013 [ h|s^ bk] : Um [ disfm arker] Oh , I see .
m e013 [ s] : Down near t he bot t om of t his sheet .
m e013 [ b] : Uh , [ com m ent ] [ pause] yes .
m n007 [ fg] : So ,
m n007 [ b] : y eah .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m n007 [ s] : And , y eah , and here t he gap is st ill m ore im port ant
bet ween using delt a and not using delt a .
m e013 [ b] : Yes .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : If y if I t ake t he t raining s t he large t raining set , it ’s
[ disfm arker] we have one hundred and sev ent y − t wo ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : and one hundred and four when we use delt a .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh.x |s^ rt ] : Uh . [ pause] Even if t he cont ext s used is quit e t he
sam e ,
m n007 [ s] : because wit hout delt a we use sevent eent hs [ disfm arker]
sev ent een fram es .
m n007 [ fh] : Uh .
m n007 [ fh|s^ rt ] : Yeah , um , so t he second point is t hat we have no
single cross − language experim ent s , uh , t hat we did not have last
week .
m n007 [ fh|s] : Uh , so t his is t raining t he net on French only ,
m n007 [ s] : or on English only ,
m n007 [ s] : and t est ing on It alian .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : And t raining t he net on French only
m n007 [ s] : and Spanish only
m n007 [ s] : and t est ing on , uh TI − digit s .
m e013 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ %−−] : And ,
m n007 [ fh] : fff [ com m ent ] um ,
m n007 [ fh] : yeah .
m n007 [ s] : What we see is t hat t hese net s are not as good ,
m n007 [ s] : ex cept for t he m ult i − English , which is always one of t he
best .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ s^ rt .x ] : t hen we st art ed t o work on a large dat dat abase
cont aining , uh , sent ences from t he French , from t he Spanish , from
t he TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from [ com m ent ] uh English digit s , and from
It alian digit s .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : So t his is t he [ disfm arker] anot her line [ disfm arker]
anot her set of lines in t he t able .

m e013 [ b] : Ah , y es .
m n007 [ s.%] : Uh , @ @ wit h SPINE
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : and [ pause] uh , act ually we did t his before knowing t he
result of all t he dat a ,
m n007 [ s] : uh , so we have t o t o redo t he uh [ disfm arker] t he
ex perim ent t raining t he net wit h , uh PLP , but wit h delt a .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : But
m n007 [ s] : um t his [ disfm arker] t his net perform ed quit e well .
m n007 [ %−−] : Well ,
m n007 [ s] : it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s bet t er t han t he net using French ,
Spanish , and English only .
m n007 [ b] : Uh .
m n007 [ fg] : So ,
m n007 [ b] : uh , yeah .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : We have also st art ed feat ure com binat ion experim ent s
.
m n007 [ s] : Uh m any experim ent s using feat ures and net out put s
t oget her .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : And t his is [ disfm arker] The result s are on t he ot her
docum ent .
m n007 [ s^ cs] : Uh , we can discuss t his aft er , perhaps [ disfm arker]
well , just , @ @ .
m n007 [ s] : Yeah , so basically t here are four [ disfm arker] four kind of
sy st em s .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : The first one , yeah , is com bining , um , t wo feat ure
st ream s , uh using [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : and each feat ure st ream has it s own MPL .
m n007 [ s] : So it ’s t he [ disfm arker] kind of sim ilar t o t he t andem t hat
was proposed for t he first .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : The m ult i − st ream t andem for t he first proposal .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : The second is using feat ures and KLT t ransform ed MLP
out put s .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : And t he t hird one is t o u use a single KLT t rans
t ransform feat ures as well as MLP out put s .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ fh] : yeah .
m n007 [ b.%] : Mm m .
m n007 [ s^ cs] : You know you can [ disfm arker] you can com m ent t hese
result s ,
fn002 [ s^ aa.%−−] : Yes , I can s
fn002 [ s^ rt ] : I would like t o say t hat , for ex am ple , um , m m m , if we
doesn’t use t he delt a − delt a , uh we have an im prove when we use s
som e com binat ion .
fn002 [ %−] : But when

m n007 [ fg|s^ e] : Yeah , we ju just t o be clear , t he num bers here are
uh recognit ion accuracy .
fn002 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : w Yeah , t his [ disfm arker] Yeah , t his num ber
recognit ion acc
m n007 [ s] : So it ’s not t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] Again we swit ch
t o anot her [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s] : Yes , and t he baseline [ disfm arker] t he baseline have
[ disfm arker] i is eight y − t wo .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Baseline is eight y − t wo .
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah
m n007 [ s] : So it ’s experim ent only on t he It alian m ism at ched for t he
m om ent for t his .
m e013 [ fh|s^ bk^ m ] : Uh , t his is It alian m ism at ched .
fn002 [ s^ aa^ m ] : Yeah , by t he m om ent .
m n007 [ fg] : Um .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : OK .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ s^ rt ] : And first in t he experim ent − one I [ disfm arker] I do
[ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I use different MLP ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ s] : and is obviously t hat t he m ult i − English MLP is t he bet t er .
fn002 [ fh|s] : Um . for t he ne [ disfm arker] rest of experim ent I use m ult i
− English ,
fn002 [ s^ e] : only m ult i − English .
fn002 [ s] : And I t ry t o com bine different t ype of feat ure ,
fn002 [ s] : but t he result is t hat t he MSG − t hree feat ure doesn’t work
for t he It alian dat abase
fn002 [ s] : because never help t o increase t he accuracy .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Yeah , eh , act ually , if w we look at t he t able ,
m n007 [ s^ rt .%−−] : t he huge t able ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : um , we see t hat for TI − digit s MSG perform as well as
t he PLP ,
m n007 [ s] : but t his is not t he case for It alian what [ disfm arker] where
t he error rat e is c is alm ost uh t wice t he error rat e of PLP .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh|s] : So , um [ vocalsound] uh , well , I don’t t hink t his is a bug
m n007 [ s.%−−] : but t his [ disfm arker] t his is som et hing in [ disfm arker]
probably in t he MSG um process t hat
m n007 [ fh] : uh
m n007 [ s^ no] : I don’t know what exact ly .
m n007 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : Perhaps t he fact t hat t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t here ’s no low − pass filt er ,
m n007 [ %−−] : well ,
m n007 [ s^ cs] : or no pre − em p pre − em phasis filt er
m n007 [ s] : and t hat t here is som e DC offset in t he It alian ,

m n007 [ %−−] : or , well ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : som et hing sim ple like t hat .
m n007 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] t hat we need t o sort out if want t o uh get
im provem ent by com bining PLP and MSG
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ df] : because for t he m om ent MSG do doesn’t bring m uch
inform at ion .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : And as Carm en said , if we com bine t he t wo , we have t he
result , basically , of PLP .
m e013 [ %−] : I
m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : Um , t he uh , baseline syst em [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw] : when you said t he baseline syst em was uh , uh eight y −
t wo percent , t hat was t rained on what and t est ed on what ?
m e013 [ s] : That was , uh It alian m ism at ched d uh , uh , digit s , uh , is
t he t est ing ,
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : and t he t raining is It alian digit s ?
fn002 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So t he " m ism at ch " just refers t o t he noise and
[ disfm arker] and , uh m icrophone and so fort h ,
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m n007 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|qy ^ rt .%−−] : So , um did we have [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : So would t hat t hen correspond t o t he first line here of
where t he t raining is [ disfm arker] is t he uh It alian digit s ?
m e013 [ %] : The [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : The t rain t he t raining of t he HTK ?
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fn002 [ fg] : Ah y es !
fn002 [ s.%−−] : This h
fn002 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yes .
m e013 [ b] : Yes .
fn002 [ b] : Th − Yes .
m e013 [ s] : Training of t he net ,
m e013 [ b] : y eah .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : So , um [ disfm arker] So what t hat says is t hat in a
m at ched condit ion , [ vocalsound] we end up wit h a fair am ount worse
put t ing in t he uh PLP .
m e013 [ qy.%−−] : Now w would [ disfm arker] do we hav e a num ber , I
suppose for t he m at ched [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t m ean m at ched ,

m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : but uh use of It alian [ disfm arker] t raining in
It alian digit s for PLP only ?
fn002 [ h|s^ aa^ rt ] : Uh [ pause] y es ?
m n007 [ h|s^ aa] : Uh [ pause] yeah ,
m n007 [ s] : so t his is [ disfm arker] basically t his is in t he t able .
m n007 [ fh|s^ rt ] : Uh [ pause] so t he num ber is fift y − t wo ,
fn002 [ s^ 2] : Anot her t able .
m n007 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu^ m ] : Fift y − t wo percent .
m n007 [ s.%−] : Fift − So [ disfm arker] No , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s t he
[ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m |qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : No , fift y − t wo percent of eight y − t wo ?
m n007 [ s] : Of [ disfm arker] of [ disfm arker] of uh [ pause] eight een
[ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s] : Eight y .
fn002 [ s^ r] : Eight y .
m n007 [ s^ r] : of eight een .
m n007 [ s] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s error rat e , basically .
fn002 [ s^ rt ] : It ’s plus six .
m n007 [ s^ bsc] : It ’s er error rat e rat io .
m n007 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ fe] : Oh t his is accuracy !
m e013 [ b.%] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oy ! [ com m ent ] OK .
m n007 [ fg|s] : Uh , so we have nine [ disfm arker] nine [ disfm arker] let ’s
say ninet y percent .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Ninet y .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh|s] : Um [ com m ent ] which is uh [ com m ent ] what we have
also if use PLP and MSG t oget her ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : eight y − nine point sev en .
m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : OK , so even just PLP , uh , it is not , in t he m at ched
condit ion [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um I wonder if it ’s a difference bet ween PLP and m el
cepst ra , or whet her it ’s t hat t he net half , for som e reason , is not
helping .
m n007 [ b] : Uh .
m n007 [ s] : P − PLP and Mel cepst ra give t he sam e [ disfm arker] sam e
result s .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Sam e result pret t y m uch ?
m n007 [ s] : Well , we have t hese result s .
m n007 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .

m n007 [ s.%−−] : It ’s not [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|%−] : So , s
m n007 [ qy^ rt ^ t 3] : Do you hav e t his result wit h PLP alone , [ com m ent ]
j fee feeding HTK ?
m n007 [ s] : That [ disfm arker] That ’s what you m ean ?
fn002 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : Just PLP at t he input of HTK .
fn002 [ s^ bk] : yeah y eah yeah yeah ,
fn002 [ s.%−−] : at t he first [ disfm arker] and t he [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : So , PLP [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Eight y − eight point six .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : Um , so adding MSG
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s^ bu] : um [ disfm arker] Well , but t hat ’s [ disfm arker] yeah ,
t hat ’s wit hout t he neural net ,
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n007 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , t hat ’s wit hout t he neural net
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : and t hat ’s t he result basically t hat OGI has also wit h
t he MFCC wit h on − line norm alizat ion .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : But she had said eight y − t wo .
m n007 [ s] : This is t he [ disfm arker] w well , but t his is wit hout on − line
norm alizat ion .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s^ bk|qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Oh , t his [ disfm arker] t he eight y − t wo .
fn002 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : Eight y − t wo is t he [ disfm arker] it ’s t he Aurora baseline ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : so MFCC .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Then we can use [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : well , OGI , t hey use MFCC [ disfm arker] t h t he baseline
MFCC plus on − line norm alizat ion
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ fa] : Oh , I ’m sorry ,
m e013 [ s] : I k I keep get t ing confused
m e013 [ s^ df] : because t his is accuracy .
m n007 [ s^ bk|s^ fa] : Yeah , sorry .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK . Alright .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ df] : Alright . So t his is [ disfm arker] I was t hinking all
t his was worse .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ bs] : OK so t his is all bet t er
m e013 [ s] : because eight y − nine is bigger t han eight y − t wo .

fn002 [ s^ m ^ na] : Yes , bet t er .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ t c] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m all bet t er now .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ co] : OK , go ahead .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : So what happ what happens is t hat when we apply on −
line norm alizat ion we jum p t o alm ost ninet y percent .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Uh , when we apply a neural net work , is t he sam e .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : We j jum p t o ninet y percent .
fn002 [ s^ ng] : Nnn , we don’t know exact ly .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker] And um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : what ev er t he norm alizat ion , act ually .
m n007 [ s] : If we use n neural net work , even if t he feat ures are not
correct ly norm alized , we jum p t o ninet y percent .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So we go from eight y − si eight y − eight point six t o
[ disfm arker] t o ninet y , or som et hing .
m n007 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s.%−] : Well , ninet y [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ ar|s.%−−] : No , I [ disfm arker] I m ean ninet y
m n007 [ s] : It ’s around eight y − nine ,
m n007 [ s] : ninet y ,
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Eight y − nine .
m n007 [ s] : eight y − eight .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : Well , t here are m inor [ disfm arker] m inor differences .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : And t hen adding t he MSG does not hing , basically .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : No .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah . OK .
m n007 [ s^ e] : Uh For It alian , yeah .
m e013 [ s|s^ bk] : For t his case , right ?
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ b] : Alright .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : So , um [ disfm arker] So act ually , t he answer for
ex perim ent s wit h one is t hat adding MSG , if you [ disfm arker] uh does
not help in t hat case .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ s] : And t he m ult i − English , does
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]

eight een percent error rat e , roughly .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : Um [ pause] and [ pause] we uh alm ost , uh cut t hat in half
by um put t ing in t he on − line norm alizat ion and t he neural net .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah
m e013 [ s] : And t he MSG doesn’t however part icularly affect t hings .
m n007 [ b] : No .
m e013 [ s] : And we cut off , I guess about t went y − five percent of t he

m e013 [ fh|s^ t 1] : Uh [ pause] no , not quit e t hat ,
m e013 [ qy ^ g^ t 1] : is it .
m e013 [ s^ t 1] : Uh , t wo point six out of eight een .
m e013 [ s] : About , um [ pause] sixt een percent or som et hing of t he

m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : Yes , good .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK ?
m e013 [ s] : So t hen you ’re assum ing m ult i − English is closer t o t he

m e013 [ s^ df] : since you ’re not gonna have m at ching , uh , dat a for
t he [ disfm arker] uh for t he new [ disfm arker] for t he ot her languages
and so fort h .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um , one qu t hing is t hat ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : uh [ disfm arker] I t hink I asked you t his before ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : but I wanna double check .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : When you say " ME " in t hese ot her t est s , t hat ’s t he

m e013 [ s^ bu] : but it is not all of t he m ult i − English ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ s] : It is som e piece of [ disfm arker] part of it .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Or , one m illion fram es .

m e006 [ s] : Well St ephane was saying t hat t hey weren’t hand − labeled
,
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Yeah , it ’s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e006 [ s] : t he French and t he Spanish .
fn002 [ s^ 2] : The Spanish .
fn002 [ s] : Maybe for t hat .
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .

m e013 [ s] : It ’s st ill [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ co] : Alright , go ahead .
m e013 [ %−−] : And t hen [ disfm arker] t hen [ disfm arker]

t he sam e help not hing .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .

fn002 [ s] : And we have a l lit t le bit less result t han t he [ disfm arker]
t he [ disfm arker] t he baseline PLP wit h delt a and delt a − delt a .

m n007 [ fg|s.%−−] : Act ually , just t o be som e m ore [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %−−] : Do
m n007 [ s.%−] : This num ber , t his eight y − seven point one num ber ,

m e013 [ fg|s] : Yes , yeah , I m ean it can’t be com pared wit h t he ot her
m n007 [ qw] : Which num ber ?
m e013 [ s^ df] : cuz t his is , uh [ disfm arker] wit h m ult i − English , uh ,
t raining .
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So you have t o com pare it wit h t he one over t hat you ’ve

m e013 [ s] : which is t hat , uh t he eight y − four point six .
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m n007 [ fg] : Uh .
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fg|s] : Yeah , but I m ean in t his case for t he eight y − seven
point one we used MLP out put s for t he PLP net
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : and st raight feat ures wit h delt a − delt a .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : And st raight feat ures wit h delt a − delt a gives you what ’s
on t he first sheet .
m e013 [ s.%−] : Not t not
m n007 [ s] : It ’s eight eight y − eight point six .
m e013 [ s^ ar] : t r No . No . No .
fn002 [ s^ ar] : Yes .
m e013 [ s] : Not t rained wit h m ult i − English .
fn002 [ s^ ar|s^ df.%−] : No , but t hey [ disfm arker] t hey feat ure @ @
wit hout [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk|s^ df] : Uh , yeah , but t h t his is t he second configurat ion
.
m n007 [ s] : So we use feat ure out uh , net out put s t oget her wit h
feat ures .
m n007 [ fh] : So yeah ,
m n007 [ s^ ar] : t his is not [ disfm arker] perhaps not clear here

m n007 [ s] : but in t his t able , t he first colum n is for MLP and t he
second for t he feat ures .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Eh . [ com m ent ] Oh , I see .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : Ah . So you ’re say ing w so asking t he quest ion , "
What [ disfm arker] what has adding t he MLP done t o im prov e over t he ,
m n007 [ fg] : So , just [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fg] : Yeah
m n007 [ s] : so , act ually it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it decreased t he
[ disfm arker] t he accuracy .
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yes .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ s^ df^ rt ] : Because we hav e eight y − eight point six .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : And even t he MLP alone [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ qw^ rt ^ t 1] : What gives t he MLP alone ?
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Mult i − English PLP .
m n007 [ s^ bsc] : Oh no ,
m n007 [ s^ bsc] : it giv es eight y − t hree point six .
m n007 [ s] : So we have our eight y − t hree point six and now eight y −
eight y point six ,
fn002 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : t hat giv es eight y − seven point one .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Eight y − s
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I t hought it was eight y
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK ,
m e013 [ s] : eight y − t hree point six and eight y [ disfm arker] eight y −
eight point six .
m n007 [ s^ t 1] : Eight y − t hree point six .
m n007 [ s^ t 1.%−−] : Eight y [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t h is t hat right ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ?
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
fn002 [ fg|s^ rt ] : But [ disfm arker] I don’t know [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s] : but m ay be if we have t he neural net work t rained wit h t he
PLP [ pause] delt a and delt a − delt a , m aybe t ha t his can help .
m n007 [ s^ am ] : Perhaps , yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aap] : Well , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s one t hing ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but see t he ot her t hing is t hat ,
m e013 [ s^ ba] : um , I m ean it ’s good t o t ake t he difficult case ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : but let ’s [ disfm arker] let ’s consider what t hat m eans .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : What [ disfm arker] what we ’re saying is t hat one o one
of t he t hings t hat [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s] : I m ean m y int erpret at ion of your [ disfm arker] your s
original suggest ion is som et hing like t his , as m ot ivat ion .
m e013 [ s] : When we t rain on dat a t hat is in one sense or anot her ,
sim ilar t o t he t est ing dat a , t hen we get a win by having discrim inant
t raining .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : When we t rain on som et hing t hat ’s quit e different , we
have a pot ent ial t o have som e problem s .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And , um , if we get som et hing t hat helps us when it ’s
som ewhat sim ilar , and doesn’t hurt us t oo m uch when it [ disfm arker]
when it ’s quit e different , t hat ’s m ay be not so bad .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So t he quest ion is , if you t ook t he sam e com binat ion ,
and you t ried it out on , uh [ disfm arker] on say digit s ,
m n007 [ b.%] : Mm m .
m n007 [ qy^ 2^ bu] : On TI − digit s ?
m n007 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ f] : you know ,
m e013 [ qy^ rt ] : d Was t hat experim ent done ?
m n007 [ s^ ar] : No , not yet .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , OK .
m e013 [ qo] : Uh , t hen does t hat , eh [ disfm arker] you know m aybe
wit h sim ilar noise condit ions and so fort h , [ com m ent ] does it
[ disfm arker] does it t hen look m uch bet t er ?
m n007 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qo] : And so what is t he range over t hese different kinds of uh
[ disfm arker] of t est s ?
m e013 [ s^ t c] : So , an anyway .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ co] : OK , go ahead .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
fn002 [ s] : And , wit h t his t ype of configurat ion which I do on
ex perim ent using t he new neural net wit h nam e broad klat t s t went y −
sev en ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ s] : uh , d I have found m ore or less t he sam e result .
m n007 [ s^ ba] : So , it ’s slight ly bet t er ,
fn002 [ s] : Lit t le bit bet t er ?
m n007 [ b] : y eah .
m e013 [ s^ aa^ m ] : Slight ly bet t er .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
fn002 [ s^ aa^ m ] : Slight ly bet bet t er .
fn002 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yes , is bet t er .
m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and y ou know again m aybe if you use t he
, uh , delt a [ pause] t here , uh , you would bring it up t o where it was ,
uh y ou know at least about t he sam e for a difficult case .

fn002 [ fg|s^ am ] : Yeah , m aybe . Maybe . Maybe .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
fn002 [ s^ bk] : Oh , y eah .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
fn002 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Oh , yeah .
m n007 [ s^ t ^ t c] : Well , so perhaps let ’s [ disfm arker] let ’s jum p at t he
last ex perim ent .
m n007 [ s] : It ’s eit her less inform at ion from t he neural net work if we
use only t he silence out put .
fn002 [ %−] : i
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : It ’s again bet t er .
m n007 [ s] : So it ’s eight y − nine point [ disfm arker] point one .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah ,
fn002 [ s] : and we have only fort y [ disfm arker] fort y feat ure
m n007 [ fh] : So .
fn002 [ s] : because in t his sit uat ion we hav e one hundred and t hree
feat ure .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
fn002 [ s.%−−] : And t hen w wit h t he first configurat ion , I f I am found
t hat work , uh , doesn’t work [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fn002 [ s] : uh , well , work ,
fn002 [ s] : but is bet t er , t he second configurat ion .
fn002 [ s] : Because I [ disfm arker] for t he del Engli − PLP delt a and delt a
− delt a , here I have eight y − fiv e point t hree accuracy ,
fn002 [ s] : and wit h t he second configurat ion I have eight y − seven
point one .
m e013 [ fh|s^ t ^ t c] : Um , by t he way , t here is a anot her , uh ,
suggest ion t hat would apply , uh , t o t he second configurat ion ,
m e013 [ s] : um , which , uh , was m ade , uh , by , uh , Hari .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t hat was t hat , um , if you have [ disfm arker] uh
feed t wo st ream s int o HTK , um , and y ou , uh , change t he , uh
v ariances [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : if you scale t he variances associat ed wit h , uh t hese
st ream s um , you can effect ively scale [ pause] t he st ream s .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ fh|s] : So , um , you know , wit hout changing t he script s for
HTK ,
m e013 [ s] : which is t he rule here , uh , y ou can st ill change t he
v ariances
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n007 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ s] : which would effect ively change t he scale of t hese
[ disfm arker] t hese , uh , t wo st ream s t hat com e in .
m n007 [ b] : Uh , [ com m ent ] yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : And , um , so , um , if you do t hat , for inst ance it m ay
be t he case t hat , um , t he MLP should not be considered as st rongly ,
for inst ance .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : And , um , so t his is just set t ing t hem t o be ,
m e013 [ s^ fa] : excuse m e ,
m e013 [ s] : of equal [ disfm arker] equal weight .
m e013 [ s] : May be it shouldn’t be equal weight .
fn002 [ s^ am ] : May be .
m e013 [ s] : Right ? You know , I I ’m sorry t o say t hat gives m ore
ex perim ent s if we want ed t o look at t hat ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : but [ disfm arker] but , uh , um , you know on t he ot her
hand it ’s just experim ent s at t he level of t he HTK recognit ion .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s not even t he HTK ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh , uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah . Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Well , I guess you have t o do t he HTK t raining also .
fn002 [ s] : so t his is what we decided t o do .
m e013 [ fh|qy ^ rt ] : Uh , do you ?
m e013 [ h] : Let m e t hink .
m e013 [ s^ t 1] : Maybe you don’t .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , you have t o change t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ t 1.%−−] : No , you can just do it in [ disfm arker] as
[ disfm arker] once y ou ’ve done t he t raining [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s^ 2] : And t hen you can vary it .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , t he t raining is just com ing up wit h t he
v ariances
m e006 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : so I guess you could [ disfm arker] you could just scale
t hem all .
m n007 [ qy^ d^ m ] : Scale
m e013 [ s] : Variances .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ %−−] : But [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Is it [ disfm arker] i t h I m ean t he HTK m odels are diagonal
cov ariances ,
m n007 [ qy.%−] : so I d Is it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : That ’s uh , exact ly t he point , I t hink ,

m e013 [ s.%−−] : t hat if you change [ disfm arker] um , change what t hey
are [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s diagonal covariance m at rices ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : but you say what t hose variances are .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So , t hat [ disfm arker] you know , it ’s diagonal , but t he
diagonal m eans t h t hat t hen you ’re gonna [ disfm arker] it ’s gonna
[ disfm arker] it ’s gonna int ernally m ult iply it [ disfm arker] and
[ disfm arker] and uh , [ vocalsound] uh , i it im uh im plicit ly
ex ponent iat ed t o get probabilit ies , and so it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s gonna
[ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s going t o affect t he range of t hings if
y ou change t he [ disfm arker] change t he v ariances [ pause] of som e of
t he feat ures .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
fn002 [ %−] : do ?
m e013 [ s] : So , i it ’s precisely giv en t hat m odel you can very sim ply

m e013 [ s] : That was [ disfm arker] t hat was , uh , Hari ’s suggest ion .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah . Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So , um [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fg|s] : So it could just be t hat h t reat ing t hem equally , t ea
t reat ing t wo st ream s equally is just [ disfm arker] just not t he right t hing
t o do .
m e013 [ s] : Of course it ’s pot ent ially opening a can of worm s
m e013 [ s] : because , you know , m ay be it should be a different

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs^ t c] : So I guess t he ot her t hing is t o t ake [ disfm arker]
y ou know [ disfm arker] if one were t o t ake , uh , you know , a couple of

m n007 [ fg|s^ 2] : Yeah , and t est across ev eryt hing .

m n007 [ s] : Basically , t his is a TRAP syst em [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : kind of TRAP syst em , I m ean ,
m n007 [ s] : but where t he neural net work are replaced by LDA .
m n007 [ fh] : Hm m . [ vocalsound] Um , y eah ,
m n007 [ s] : and about m ult i − band ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : uh , I st art ed m ult i − band MLP t rainings ,
m n007 [ fh] : um
m n007 [ s] : m m h [ com m ent ] Act ually , I w I w hhh [ com m ent ] prefer t o
do exact ly what I did when I was in Belgium .
m n007 [ s] : So I t ake exact ly t he sam e configurat ions ,
m n007 [ s] : sev en bands wit h nine fram es of cont ext ,
m n007 [ s] : and we just t rain on TIMIT ,
m n007 [ s] : and on t he large dat abase ,
m n007 [ s] : so , wit h SPINE and everyt hing .
m n007 [ fh] : And ,
m n007 [ s] : m m m , I ’m st art ing t o t rain also , net works wit h larger
cont ext s .
m n007 [ s] : So , t his would [ disfm arker] would be som et hing bet ween
TRAPS and m ult i − band
m n007 [ s] : because we st ill have quit e large bands ,
m n007 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] but wit h a lot of cont ext also .
m n007 [ fh] : So Um
m n007 [ fg] : Yeah ,

m n007 [ s] : we st ill have t o work on Finnish ,
m n007 [ s] : um , basically , t o m ake a decision on which MLP can be
t he best across t he different languages .
m n007 [ s] : For t he m om ent it ’s t he TIMIT net work , and perhaps t he
net work t rained on everyt hing .
m n007 [ fh|s] : So . Now we can t est t hese t wo net works on
[ disfm arker] wit h [ disfm arker] wit h delt a and large net works .
m n007 [ s] : Well , t est t hem also on Finnish
fn002 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ s] : and see which one is t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he
best .
m n007 [ s] : Uh , well , t he next part of t he docum ent is , well , basically
, a kind of sum m ary of what [ disfm arker] everyt hing t hat has been
done .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : So . We have sevent y − nine M L Ps t rained on
m n007 [ s^ t 1] : one , t wo , t hree , four , uh , t hree , four , five , six ,
sev en
m n007 [ s] : t en [ disfm arker] on t en different dat abases .
m e013 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Uh ,
m n007 [ s^ ba] : t he num ber of fram es is bad also ,
m n007 [ s] : so we have one m illion and a half for som e ,
m n007 [ s] : t hree m illion for ot her ,
m n007 [ s] : and six m illion for t he last one .
m n007 [ fh] : Uh ,
m n007 [ fg|s] : yeah ! [ com m ent ] As we m ent ioned , TIMIT is t he only
t hat ’s hand − labeled ,
m n007 [ s] : and perhaps t his is what m akes t he difference .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s] : Yeah , t he ot her are just Vit erbi − aligned .
m n007 [ s] : So t hese sevent y − nine MLP differ on different t hings .
m n007 [ s] : First , um wit h respect t o t he on − line norm alizat ion ,
m n007 [ s] : t here are [ disfm arker] t hat use bad on − line norm alizat ion
,
m n007 [ s] : and ot her good on − line norm alizat ion .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s] : Wit h respect t o t he feat ures ,
m n007 [ s] : wit h respect t o t he use of delt a
m n007 [ s^ bsc] : or no ,
m n007 [ s^ bsc] : uh wit h respect t o t he hidden layer size and t o t he
t arget s .
m n007 [ s] : Uh , but of course we don’t have all t he com binat ion of
t hese different param et ers
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ qw] : s What ’s t his ?
m n007 [ s] : We only have t wo hundred eight y six different t est s

m n007 [ s] : And no not t wo t housand .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ s] : Ugh ! I was im pressed
m e013 [ s^ fe] : boy ,
m e013 [ s] : t wo t housand .
m n007 [ s] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fn002 [ b] : Ah , yes .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ j] : Alright , now I ’m just slight ly im pressed ,
fn002 [ s.%−−] : I say t his m orning t hat @ @ t hought it was t he
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m n007 [ fg] : Um .
m n007 [ fg|s] : Yeah , basically t he observat ion is what we discussed
already .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : The MSG problem ,
m n007 [ fh] : um ,
m n007 [ s] : t he fact t hat t he MLP t rained on t arget t ask decreased t he
error rat e .
m n007 [ s] : but when t he M − MLP is t rained on t he um [ disfm arker] is
not t rained on t he t arget t ask , it increased t he error rat e com pared
t o using st raight feat ures .
m n007 [ s] : Except if t he feat ures are bad [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh|s^ bsc] : uh , act ually except if t he feat ures are not correct ly
on − line norm alized .
m n007 [ s] : In t his case t he t andem is st ill bet t er
m n007 [ s] : ev en if it ’s t rained on [ disfm arker] not on t he t arget digit s
.
m e013 [ fg|s^ bs^ cs] : Yeah . So it sounds like [ vocalsound] yeah , t he
net correct s som e of t he problem s wit h som e poor norm alizat ion .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : But if y ou can do good norm alizat ion it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
uh [ disfm arker] OK .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Uh , so t he fourt h point is , yeah , t he TIMIT plus noise
seem s t o be t he t raining set t hat gives bet t er [ disfm arker] t he best
net work .
m e013 [ fg|s^ t c] : So So − Let m e [ disfm arker] bef before you go on t o
t he possible issues .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So , on t he MSG uh problem
m e013 [ s.%−−] : um , I t hink t hat in [ disfm arker] in t he [ disfm arker] um ,
in t he short [ pause] t im e [ pause] solut ion
m e013 [ s.%−−] : um , t hat is , um , t rying t o figure out what we can

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : uh , m uch as I said wit h JRASTA ,
m e013 [ s] : ev en t hough I really like JRASTA

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : And uh it m ight be [ disfm arker] if som eone ’s

m e013 [ s] : once we get out of t his part icular rush [ pause] uh for

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : But in t he short t erm , unless you have som e
[ disfm arker] som e s st rong idea of what ’s wrong ,
m n007 [ s^ no^ rt ] : I don’t know at all
m n007 [ s^ df] : but I ’ve [ disfm arker] perhaps [ disfm arker] I have t he

m n007 [ s^ bk|s^ no] : Yeah . [ pause] My [ disfm arker] But I don’t know .
m e013 [ s] : There ’s supposed t o [ disfm arker] well MSG is supposed t o

m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n007 [ s^ na] : It ’s [ disfm arker] There is , yeah , an AGC − kind of AGC
.
m n007 [ b] : Yeah . [ vocalsound] Yeah . Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah , but also t here ’s an on − line norm besides t he

m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ s^ aa] : y eah ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : t aking out m eans and variances and so fort h .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : In fac in fact t he on − line norm alizat ion t hat we ’re using

m e013 [ s.%−−] : so it ’s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ h] : Um .
m n007 [ s^ bk|%−−] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s] : If it ’s on t he t arget t ask t hen it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker]
it helps t o hav e t he MLP t ransform ing it .

m e013 [ s] : If it uh [ disfm arker] if it ’s not on t he t arget t ask , t hen ,
depending on how different it is , uh you can get uh , a reduct ion in

m n007 [ b] : Mm m .

when t here is som et hing like t he t raining dat a .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fg] : Um .
m n007 [ fg|s^ rt .%−−] : Yeah . So , [ pause] t he [ disfm arker] t he reason
[ disfm arker] Yeah , t he reason is t hat t he [ disfm arker] perhaps t he
t arget [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he t ask dependency [ disfm arker]
t he language dependency , [ vocalsound] and t he noise dependency

m e013 [ s^ bs^ rt ^ t ^ t c.%−−] : So you ’re saying t hat um , um , alt hough
from what we see ,

t he neural net is t rained on one of t hose and t est ed on som et hing

m n007 [ fh|%] : Uh , t raining
m n007 [ fh|s.%−−] : s Right . So [ disfm arker] Yeah , t he t raining t arget s
act ually ,
m n007 [ s] : t he t wo of t he m ain issues perhaps are st ill t he language
dependency [ v ocalsound] and t he noise dependency .
m n007 [ s^ cs] : And perhaps t o t ry t o reduce t he language

t arget s .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : And labeling s labeling seem s im port ant
m n007 [ s^ df] : uh , because of TIMIT result s .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Uh .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : For m om ent you use [ disfm arker] we use phonet ic
t arget s
m n007 [ s] : but we could also use art iculat ory t arget s , soft t arget s ,
m n007 [ s^ cs] : and perhaps even , um use net works t hat doesn’t do
classificat ion
m n007 [ s] : but just regression
m n007 [ s.%−−] : so uh , t rain t o have neural net works t hat
m n007 [ fh] : um , um , uh ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : does a regression
m n007 [ s^ cs] : and well , basically com com com put e feat ures and
noit not , nnn , feat ures wit hout noise . I m ean uh , t ransform t he fea
noisy feat ures [ v ocalsound] in ot her feat ures t hat are not noisy .
m n007 [ s^ cs] : But cont inuous feat ures .

m n007 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah , t hat [ pause] seem s like a good t hing t o do ,

m e013 [ fh] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ s] : not uh again a short − t erm sort of t hing .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean one of t he t hings about t hat is t hat um it ’s
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : e u t he ri I guess t he m ajor risk you have t here of being
[ disfm arker] is being dependent on [ disfm arker] very dependent on
t he kind of noise and [ disfm arker] and so fort h .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : f But , y eah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh . But it ’s anot her t hing t o t ry .
m n007 [ s] : So , t his is w w i wa wa t his is one t hing , t his [ disfm arker]
t his could be [ disfm arker] could help [ disfm arker] could help perhaps
t o reduce language dependency
m n007 [ s] : and for t he noise part um we could com bine t his wit h ot her
approaches , like , well , t he Kleinschm idt approach .
m n007 [ s] : So t he d t he idea of put t ing all t he noise t hat we can find
inside a dat abase .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n007 [ s] : I t hink Kleinschm idt was using m ore t han fift y different

m n007 [ s^ rt ] : and [ disfm arker] So t his is one [ vocalsound] approach
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : and t he ot her is m ult i − band [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] uh
, t hat I t hink is m ore robust t o t he noisy changes .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ am ] : So perhaps , I t hink som et hing like m ult i − band
t rained on a lot of noises wit h uh , feat ures − based t arget s could
[ disfm arker] could [ disfm arker] could help .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ ba] : Yeah , if y ou [ disfm arker] i i It ’s int erest ing
t hought
m e013 [ s.%−−] : m ay be if you just t rained up [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean w yeah , one [ disfm arker] one fant asy would be you
have som et hing like art iculat ory t arget s
m e013 [ s] : and y ou have [ pause] um som e reasonable dat abase ,
m e013 [ fh] : um
m e013 [ s] : but t hen [ disfm arker] which is um [ vocalsound] copied
ov er m any t im es wit h a range of different noises ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] If [ disfm arker] Cuz what
y ou ’re t ry ing t o [ pause] do is com e up wit h a [ disfm arker] a core ,

m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t hen um [ disfm arker] t hen see , [ pause] again ,
how [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : We know t hat t here ’s a m is t here ’s a uh [ disfm arker] a
[ disfm arker] a loss in perform ance when t he neural net is t rained on

t est on ,
m e013 [ qo] : but well , if you look over a range of t hese different t est s
um , how well do t hese different ways of com bining t he st raight

fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat seem s like t he
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he real quest ion .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And if you know t hat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So if y ou just t ake PLP wit h uh , t he double − delt as .
m e013 [ s] : Assum e t hat ’s t he p t he feat ure .
m e013 [ s] : look at t hese different ways of com bining it .
m e013 [ s] : And uh , t ake [ disfm arker] let ’s say , just t ake uh m ult i −

m e013 [ s^ df] : cause t hat works pret t y well for t he t raining .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And just look [ disfm arker] t ake t hat case and t hen look

m e013 [ qw] : How does t hat [ disfm arker] How does t hat com pare
bet ween t he [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : So all t he [ disfm arker] all t he t est set s you m ean ,
m n007 [ b] : yeah .

m e013 [ s^ m ^ na] : All t he different t est set s ,
m n007 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ qw.%−−] : Um . [ pause] How well do t hey st and up , over t he
[ disfm arker]
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ s] : And perhaps doing t his for [ disfm arker] cha changing t he

[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : That ’s anot her possibilit y if you have t im e ,
m e013 [ b] : yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n007 [ s] : Yeah , so t hi t his sh would be m ore working on t he MLP as

m n007 [ %−] : Cuz [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : Perhaps t he insert idea is kind of st range
m n007 [ s^ df^ rt ] : because nnn , t hey [ disfm arker] t hey m ake LDA

m e013 [ s^ aap|s^ ba] : Yeah . [ pause] It ’s a lit t le st range
m n007 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker] ?

m n007 [ fg] : And [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and

m n007 [ s^ df] : And because also perhaps we know t hat t he
[ disfm arker] when we have very good feat ures t he MLP doesn’t help .

m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : Um , t he ot her t hing , t hough , is t hat
m e013 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s^ bu] : So . Uh , we [ disfm arker] we wanna get t heir pat h

m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n007 [ s^ aa|s.%−] : Yeah , t he [ disfm arker] t he way we want t o do
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Cuz t hey ’re doing LDA [ pause] RASTA .
m n007 [ %−−] : The

m e013 [ s^ r] : They ’re doing LDA RASTA ,
m n007 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , t he way we want t o do it perhaps is t o
[ disfm arker] just t o get t he VAD labels and t he final feat ures .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : y eah ?
m n007 [ s] : So t hey will send us t he [ disfm arker] Well , provide us wit h

m e013 [ b] : I see .
m e013 [ b] : I see .
m n007 [ s] : and wit h VAD uh , binary labels
m n007 [ s] : so t hat we can uh , get our MLP feat ures

m e013 [ fg] : I see .
m n007 [ %−] : So .
m e013 [ s] : So we [ disfm arker] So . First t hing of course we ’d wanna

[ com m ent ] t hat
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : u Um , uh , when you ’re t alking about com bining
m ult iple feat ures ,
m e013 [ s:s] : um [ disfm arker] Suppose we said , " OK , we ’ve got
t hese different feat ures and so fort h ,
m e013 [ s^ ba:s] : but PLP seem s [ pause] pret t y good . "
m e013 [ s.%−−] : If we t ake t he approach t hat Mike did and have
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , one of t he sit uat ions we have is we have t hese

m e013 [ s] : We hav e different languages ,
m e013 [ s] : we hav e different [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] different

m e013 [ s^ cs] : Um [ pause] If we have som e drast ically different

m n007 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ s] : And put [ disfm arker] put t hem t oget her .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : What [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker] What Mike found ,
for t he rev erberat ion case at least , I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , who knows if it ’ll work for t hese ot her ones .
m e013 [ s] : That you did have nice int erpolat ive effect s .

m e013 [ s^ rt ] : That is , t hat yes , if you knew [ pause] what t he
rev erberat ion condit ion was gonna be and you t rained for t hat , t hen
y ou got t he best result s .
m e013 [ s] : But if you had , say , a heav ily − reverberat ion ca heav y −

m e013 [ s] : So it was sort of [ disfm arker] behaved reasonably .
m e013 [ qy .%−−] : Is t ha t hat a fair [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : So you [ disfm arker] you t hink it ’s perhaps bet t er t o

m n007 [ b] : Yeah
m n007 [ %−] : but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw] : It works bet t er if [ pause] what ?
m n007 [ %−] : Yea
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Well , see , i oc
m e013 [ s.%−−] : You were doing som e som et hing t hat was [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bd] : So m aybe t he analogy isn’t quit e right .
m e013 [ s] : You were doing som et hing t hat was in way a lit t le bet t er

m e013 [ s] : You had reverb for a single variable
m e013 [ s] : which was re uh , uh , reverberat ion .
m e013 [ s] : Here t he problem seem s t o be is t hat we don’t have a hug
a really huge net wit h a really huge am ount of t raining dat a .
m e013 [ s] : But we have s f [ pause] for t his kind of t ask , I would t hink ,
[ pause] sort of a m odest am ount .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , a m illion fram es act ually isn’t t hat m uch .
m e013 [ s] : We have a m odest am ount of [ disfm arker] of uh t raining
dat a from a couple different condit ions ,
m e013 [ s] : and t hen uh [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] yeah , t hat
[ disfm arker] and t he real sit uat ion is t hat t here ’s enorm ous variabilit y
t hat we ant icipat e in t he t est set in t erm s of language ,
m e013 [ s] : and noise t ype
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh , and uh , [ pause] uh , channel charact erist ic ,
m e013 [ s] : sort of all over t he m ap .
m e013 [ s] : A bunch of different dim ensions .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And so , I ’m just concerned t hat we don’t really have
[ pause] um , t he dat a t o t rain up [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean one of t he t hings t hat we were seeing is t hat when
we added in [ disfm arker] we st ill don’t have a good explanat ion for t his
,
m e013 [ s] : but we are seeing t hat we ’re adding in uh , a fe few
different dat abases

m e013 [ fh|s] : and uh t he perform ance is get t ing worse
m e013 [ fh|s] : and uh , when we just t ake one of t hose dat abases t hat
’s a pret t y good one , it act ually is [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] is
[ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] is bet t er .
m e013 [ fh|s] : And uh t hat says t o m e , y es , t hat , you know , t here
m ight be som e problem s wit h t he pronunciat ion m odels t hat som e of
t he dat abases we ’re adding in or som et hing like t hat .
m e013 [ s] : But one way or anot her [ pause] we don’t have uh ,

m e013 [ s.%−−] : So t hat I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m hoping
t hat
m e013 [ fh|s] : um , t his is anot her t ake on t he efficiency argum ent you

m e013 [ s] : which is I ’m hoping t hat wit h m oderat e size neural net s ,
uh , t hat uh if we [ disfm arker] if t hey look at m ore const rained

m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : If t he MLP does , we find , help us enough in som e

fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ fh] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So I guess t he way it would work is t hat you ’d get
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s:s] : There ’d be som e point where you say , " OK , t his is t heir
v ersion − one " or what ever ,
m e013 [ s] : and we get t hese VAD labels and feat ures and so fort h for
all t hese t est set s from t hem ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s] : and t hen um , uh , t hat ’s what we work wit h .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : We have a cert ain lev el we t ry t o im prove it wit h t his
ot her pat h
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : and t hen um , uh , when it get s t o be uh , January
m e013 [ s.%−−] : som e point
m e013 [ s:s] : uh , we say , " OK we [ disfm arker] we have shown t hat we

m e013 [ s^ cs:qo] : So now uh [ pause] um [ pause] what ’s your newest
v ersion ? "
m e013 [ s] : And t hen m aybe t hey ’ll have som et hing t hat ’s bet t er
m e013 [ s] : and t hen we [ disfm arker] we ’d com bine it .
m e013 [ s] : This is always hard .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I used t o work [ pause]
wit h uh folks who were t rying t o im prove a good uh , HMM syst em wit h
uh [ disfm arker] wit h a neural net syst em
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and uh , it was [ pause] a com m on problem t hat you ’d
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Oh , and t his [ disfm arker] Act ually , t his is t rue not just for
neural net s
m e013 [ s] : but just for [ disfm arker] in general if people were [ pause]
working wit h uh , rescoring uh , N − best list s or lat t ices t hat com e
[ disfm arker] cam e from uh , a m ainst ream recognizer .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , You get som et hing from t he [ disfm arker] t he ot her
sit e at one point and you work really hard on m aking it bet t er wit h
rescoring .
m e013 [ s] : But t hey ’re working really hard , t oo .
m e013 [ s] : So by t he t im e [ pause] y ou have uh , im proved t heir score
, t hey hav e also im proved t heir score
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : and now t here isn’t any difference ,

m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df.%−−] : because t he ot her [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So , um , I guess at som e point we ’ll have t o
m n007 [ s.%−−] : So it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] Uh ,
m e013 [ s^ bd^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re int egrat ed a lit t le m ore

m e013 [ s.%−−] : I t hink at t he m om ent t hey [ disfm arker] t hey say t hat
t hey have a bet t er t hing we can [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] e e
m e013 [ s] : What t akes all t he t im e here is t hat t h we ’re t rying so
m any t hings ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : presum ably uh , in a [ disfm arker] in a day we could t urn
around
m e013 [ s] : uh , t aking a new set of t hings from t hem and [ disfm arker]
and rescoring it ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ s^ aa|s^ am ] : Yeah . Yeah , perhaps we could .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Well , OK .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : No , t his is [ disfm arker] I t hink t his is good .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink t hat t he m ost wide open t hing is t he issues about

m e013 [ s^ f|s] : You know , da t raining t arget s and noises and so fort h
.
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : That ’s sort of wide open .
m n007 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : So we [ disfm arker] we can for [ disfm arker] we c we
can forget com bining m ult iple feat ures and MLG perhaps ,
m n007 [ qrr^ d] : or focus m ore on t he t arget s and on t he t raining dat a
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , I t hink for right now um , I t h I [ disfm arker] I
really liked MSG .
m e013 [ s] : And I t hink t hat , you know , one of t he t hings I liked about
it is has such different t em poral propert ies .
m e013 [ fh|s] : And um , I t hink t hat t here is ult im at ely a really good uh

m e013 [ fh] : Um , but um , uh ,
m e013 [ s] : we only have lim it ed t im e
m e013 [ s] : and t here ’s a lot of ot her t hings we have t o look at .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .

m e013 [ s] : And it seem s like m uch m ore core quest ions are issues
about t he t raining set
m e013 [ s] : and t he t raining t arget s ,
m e013 [ s] : and fit t ing in uh what we ’re doing wit h what t hey ’re doing
,
m e013 [ s] : and , you know , wit h lim it ed t im e .

m e013 [ s] : I t hink so ,
m e013 [ fh] : y eah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t hen , you know , once we [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Um , having gone t hrough t his [ pause] process and t rying

t o anot her sub − band .
m e006 [ s] : I wanna t ry having t he arrows go bot h ways .
m e006 [ fh|s] : And um , [ vocalsound] I ’m just gonna see if [ disfm arker]
if t hat [ disfm arker] t hat bet t er m odels [ pause] um , uh asynchrony in
