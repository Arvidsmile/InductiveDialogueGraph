m e013 [ s^ rt ] : So uh , he ’s not here ,
fn002 [ s.%−−] : So .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : so you get t o [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s] : Yeah , I will t ry t o ex plain t he t hing t hat I did t his
[ disfm arker] t his week [ disfm arker] during t his week .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fn002 [ s] : Well eh y ou know t hat I work [ disfm arker] I begin t o work
wit h a new feat ure t o det ect voice − unvoice .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ s^ rt ] : What I t rying t wo MLP t o [ disfm arker] t o t he [ disfm arker]
wit h t his new feat ure and t he fift een feat ure uh from t he eh bus base
sy st em
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : The [ disfm arker] t he m el cepst rum ?
fn002 [ s^ ar|s.%−−] : No , sat ly t he m es t he Mel Cepst rum ,
fn002 [ s] : t he new base syst em [ disfm arker] t he new base syst em .
m e018 [ s^ bk.%−−] : Oh t he [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
fn002 [ s^ aa|%−] : Yeah , we [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bc] : t he Aurora syst em .
fn002 [ s^ aa|s] : yeah t he Aurora syst em wit h t he new filt er , VAD or
som et hing like t hat .
m e018 [ b] : OK .
fn002 [ s] : And I ’m t rying t wo MLP , one one t hat only have t t hree
out put ,
fn002 [ s] : v oice , unvoice , and silence ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ s] : and ot her one t hat hav e fift y − six out put .
fn002 [ s] : The probabilit ies of t he allophone .
fn002 [ s^ rt ] : And I t ried t o do som e experim ent of recognit ion wit h
t hat
fn002 [ s] : and only have result wit h [ disfm arker] wit h t he MLP wit h t he
t hree out put .
fn002 [ s] : And I put t oget her t he fift een feat ures and t he t hree MLP
out put .
fn002 [ s] : And , well , t he result are li a lit t le bit bet t er , but m ore or
less sim ilar .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Uh , I [ disfm arker] I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m slight ly confused
.
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : What [ disfm arker] what feeds t he uh [ disfm arker] t he
t hree − out put net ?
fn002 [ s.%−] : Voice , unvoice , and si
m e013 [ s^ ar|qw^ r] : No no , what feeds it ?
m e013 [ qw] : What feat ures does it see ?
fn002 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : The feat ure [ disfm arker] t he input ?

fn002 [ s] : The input s are t he fift een [ disfm arker] t he fift een uh bases
feat ure .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fn002 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] wit h t he new code .
fn002 [ s] : And t he ot her t hree feat ures are R , t he variance of t he
difference bet ween t he t wo spect rum ,
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fn002 [ s] : t he variance of t he aut o − correlat ion funct ion , except t he
[ disfm arker] t he first point , because half t he height value is R − zero
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ s] : and also R − zero ,
fn002 [ s] : t he first coefficient of t he aut o − correlat ion funct ion .
fn002 [ s.%−−] : That is like t he energy wit h t hese t hree feat ure ,
m e013 [ b] : Right .
fn002 [ s] : also t hese t hree feat ure .
m e013 [ qr^ bu^ rt ] : You wouldn’t do like R − one over R − zero or
som et hing like t hat ?
m e013 [ s] : I m ean usually for voiced − unvoiced you ’d do [ disfm arker]
y eah , y ou ’d do som et hing [ disfm arker] you ’d do energy
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : but t hen you have som et hing like spect ral slope , which is
y ou get like R − one ov over R − zero or som et hing like t hat .
fn002 [ b] : Uh y eah .
m e018 [ qw] : What are t he R ’s ?
m e018 [ s^ df] : I ’m sorry I m issed it .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : R correlat ions .
fn002 [ s^ ar] : No ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
fn002 [ s^ ar] : R c No .
fn002 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Aut o − correlat ion ?
fn002 [ s^ aa|s] : Yes , yes , t he variance of t he aut o − correlat ion
funct ion t hat uses t hat
m e013 [ s^ aap] : Ye − Well t hat ’s t he variance ,
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : but if you just say " what is [ disfm arker] "
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , t o first order , um
m e013 [ fh|s] : yeah one of t he differences bet ween voiced , unvoiced
and silence is energy .
fn002 [ fg] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : Anot her one is [ disfm arker] but t he ot her one is t he
spect ral shape .
fn002 [ s.%−] : I I ’ll [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s^ m ] : The spect ral shape ,
fn002 [ s^ aa] : yeah .

m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : and so R − one over R − zero is what you t ypically use for
t hat .
fn002 [ s^ ar] : No ,
fn002 [ s] : I don’t use t hat [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s.%−−] : I can’t use [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No ,
m e013 [ s] : I ’m saying t hat ’s what people us t ypically use .
fn002 [ s^ ng] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s^ df:qr] : See , because it [ disfm arker] because t his is
[ disfm arker] t his is just like a single num ber t o t ell you um " does t he
spect rum look like t hat or does it look like t hat " .
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ b.%] : Oh . R [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s] : R [ disfm arker] R − zero .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So if it ’s [ disfm arker] if it ’s um [ disfm arker] if it ’s low
energy uh but t he [ disfm arker] but t he spect rum looks like t hat or like
t hat , it ’s probably silence .
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : Uh but if it ’s low energy and t he spect rum looks like t hat ,
it ’s probably unv oiced .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : So if you just [ disfm arker] if you just had t o pick t wo
feat ures t o det erm ine voiced − unvoiced , you ’d pick som et hing about
t he spect rum like uh R − one over R − zero , um and R − zero
fn002 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m ,
fn002 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : or i i you know you ’d have som e ot her energy m easure
m e013 [ %−−] : and
m e013 [ s] : like in t he old days people did like uh zero crossing count s
.
fn002 [ b] : Yeah , y eah .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right . S
m e013 [ %−] : S
fn002 [ fg|s] : Well , I can also t h use t his .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ h] : Um ,
fn002 [ s^ ba] : Bec − because t he result are a lit t le bit bet t er
fn002 [ s^ df] : but we have in a point t hat everyt hing is m ore or less
t he sim ilar [ disfm arker] m ore or less sim ilar .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : But um
fn002 [ s] : It ’s not quit e bet t er .

m e013 [ fg|s^ bk.%−−] : Right , but it seem ed t o m e t hat what you were
what y ou were get t ing at before was t hat t here is som et hing about t he
difference bet ween t he original signal or t he original FFT and wit h t he
filt er which is what [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : and t he variance was one t ake uh on it .
fn002 [ fg] : Yeah ,
fn002 [ s] : I used t his t oo .
m e013 [ fg] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : But it [ disfm arker] it could be som et hing else .
m e013 [ s^ df^ rt ] : Suppose you didn’t have anyt hing like t hat .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Then in t hat case , if you have t wo net s ,
m e013 [ s^ f|s.%−] : Alright , and t his one has t hree out put s , and t his
one has f
fn002 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : what ever ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : fift y − six , or som et hing ,
fn002 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : if y ou were t o sum up t he probabilit ies for t he voiced and
for t he unvoiced and for t he silence here , we ’ve found in t he past you
’ll do bet t er at voiced − unvoiced − silence t han you do wit h t his one .
m e013 [ s] : So just having t he t hree out put t hing doesn’t [ disfm arker]
doesn’t really buy you anyt hing .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : The issue is what you feed it .
fn002 [ fg] : Yeah ,
fn002 [ s.%−−] : I have [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ fh] : y eah .
m e013 [ fg] : So uh
m e018 [ s^ bu.%−−] : So you ’re saying t ake t he feat ures t hat go int o
t he v oiced − unv oiced − silence net and feed t hose int o t he ot her one ,
as addit ional input s , rat her t han having a separat e [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s^ ar.%−−] : No [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : w W well t hat ’s anot her way .
fn002 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : That wasn’t what I was saying
m e013 [ s^ ba] : but yeah t hat ’s cert ainly anot her t hing t o do .
m e013 [ qo] : No I was just t rying t o say if you b if you bring t his int o t he
pict ure ov er t his , what m ore does it buy you ?
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : And what I was saying is t hat t he only t hing I t hink t hat it
buy s y ou is um based on whet her you feed it som et hing different .
m e013 [ s] : And som et hing different in som e fundam ent al way .

m e013 [ s] : And so t he kind of t hing t hat [ disfm arker] t hat she was
t alking about before , was looking at som et hing uh ab um [ disfm arker]
som et hing uh about t he difference bet ween t he [ disfm arker] t he uh
um log FFT uh log power uh and t he log m agnit ude uh F F − spect rum
uh and t he um uh filt er bank .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : And so t he filt er bank is chosen in fact t o sort of
int egrat e out t he effect s of pit ch
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and she ’s saying
m e013 [ %−−] : y ou know t rying [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So t he part icular m easure t hat she chose was t he
v ariance of t his m of t his difference ,
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : but t hat m ight not be t he right num ber .
fn002 [ s^ am ] : May be .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s^ df] : I m ean m aybe t here ’s som et hing about t he variance
t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s not enough
m e013 [ s^ df] : or m aybe t here ’s som et hing else t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat one could use ,
m e013 [ s] : but I t hink t hat , for m e , t he t hing t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
st ruck m e was t hat uh you wanna get som et hing back here ,
m e013 [ s] : so here ’s [ disfm arker] here ’s an idea .
m e013 [ qw^ cs] : uh What about it you skip all t he [ disfm arker] all t he
really clev er t hings , and just fed t he log m agnit ude spect rum int o t his
?
fn002 [ s^ br] : Ah [ disfm arker] I ’m sorry .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : This is f
m e013 [ s] : You have t he log m agnit ude spect rum , and you were
looking at t hat and t he difference bet ween t he filt er bank and
[ disfm arker] and c c com put ing t he variance .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : That ’s a clever t hing t o do .
m e013 [ qw] : What if you st opped being clever ?
fn002 [ s^ fe] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And y ou just t ook t his t hing in here because it ’s a neural
net and neural net s are wonderful
m e013 [ s] : and figure out what t hey can [ disfm arker] what t hey m ost
need from t hings , and I m ean t hat ’s what t hey ’re good at .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So I m ean you ’re [ disfm arker] you ’re [ disfm arker] you ’re
t ry ing t o be clever and say what ’s t he st at ist ic t hat should
[ disfm arker] we should get about t his difference

m e013 [ s^ cs] : but uh in fact , you know m aybe just feeding t his in or
[ disfm arker] or feeding bot h of t hem in
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : y ou know , anot her way , saying let it figure out what ’s
t he [ disfm arker] what is t he int eract ion ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : especially if you do t his over m ult iple fram es ?
fn002 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : Then you have t his over t im e , and [ disfm arker] and bot h
kinds of m easures
m e013 [ s] : and uh you m ight get uh som et hing bet t er .
fn002 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ h] : Um .
m e018 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so don’t uh [ disfm arker] don’t do t he
div ision ,
m e018 [ s] : but let t he net hav e everyt hing .
m e013 [ s] : That ’s anot her t hing you could do
m e013 [ b] : yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , it seem s t o m e , if you have exact ly t he right t hing
t hen it ’s bet t er t o do it wit hout t he net
m e013 [ s^ df] : because ot herwise you ’re asking t he net t o learn t his
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : you know , say if you want ed t o learn how t o do
m ult iplicat ion .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean you could feed it a bunch of s you could feed t wo
num bers t hat you want ed t o m ult iply int o a net
m e013 [ s] : and have a bunch of nonlinearit ies in t he m iddle
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : and t rain it t o get t he product of t he out put and it
would work .
m e013 [ s] : But , it ’s kind of crazy ,
m e013 [ s] : cuz we know how t o m ult iply
m e013 [ s] : and you [ disfm arker] you ’d be you know m uch lower error
usually [ v ocalsound] if you just m ult iplied it out .
m e013 [ s] : But suppose you don’t really know what t he right t hing is .
m e013 [ s] : And t hat ’s what t hese sort of dum b m achine learning
m et hods are good at .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fg] : Um .
m e013 [ s^ t c] : Anyway .
m e013 [ s^ bd] : It ’s just a t hought .
m e018 [ qw] : How long does it t ake , Carm en , t o t rain up one of t hese

m e018 [ s^ bk] : Hm m .

m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , so t he uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , t he issue is whet her people m ake a decision now
based on what t hey ’ve already seen , or t hey m ake it lat er .

m e013 [ s] : And one of t he argum ent s for m aking it lat er is let ’s m ake
sure t hat what ever t echniques t hat we ’re using work for som et hing
m ore t han [ disfm arker] t han connect ed digit s .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ qw] : When are t hey planning [ disfm arker] When would t hey do
t hat ?
m e013 [ h|s] : Mm m , I t hink lat e [ disfm arker] uh I t hink in t he sum m er
som et im e .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK , t hanks .
fn002 [ s] : This is t he work t hat I did during t his dat e
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fn002 [ s^ rt ] : and also m m m I [ disfm arker] H Hynek last week say t hat
if I have t im e I can t o begin t o [ disfm arker] t o st udy
fn002 [ s^ rt .%−−] : well seriously t he France Telecom proposal
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ s^ rt .%−−] : t o look at t he code
fn002 [ s^ rt ] : and som et hing like t hat
fn002 [ s.%−−] : t o know exact ly what t hey are doing
fn002 [ s] : because m aybe t hat we can have som e ideas
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ s] : but not only t o read t he proposal .
fn002 [ s] : Look insi look i carefully what t hey are doing wit h t he
program @ @ and
fn002 [ s^ rt ^ t c] : I begin t o [ disfm arker] t o work also in t hat .
fn002 [ s.%−−] : But t he first t hing t hat I don’t underst and is t hat t hey
are using R − t he uh log energy t hat t his quit e [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s^ no] : I don’t know why t hey have som e const ant in t he
ex pression of t he lower energy .
fn002 [ s^ no] : I don’t know what t hat m eans .
m e018 [ qy ^ br^ d^ rt ] : They have a const ant in t here , you said ?
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Oh , at t he front it say s uh " log energy is equal t o t he
rounded v ersion of sixt een over t he log of t wo "
fn002 [ %−] : This [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
fn002 [ s] : Then m aybe I can underst and .
m e013 [ %−−] : uh t im es t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : Well , t his is nat ural log ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and m aybe it has som et hing t o do wit h t he fact t hat
t his is [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t hat som e kind of base conversion ,
m e013 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I hav e no idea .

m e018 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , t hat ’s what I was t hinking ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : but [ disfm arker] but um , t hen t here ’s t he sixt y − four ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : Uh , [ vocalsound] I don’t know .
fn002 [ s.%−−] : Because m aybe t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t he t hreshold t hat
t hey are using on t he basis of t his v alue [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : Ex perim ent al result s .
m e006 [ s^ j] : Mc − McDonald ’s const ant .
fn002 [ s^ bd^ no] : I don’t know exact ly ,
fn002 [ s^ df] : because well t h I t hought m aybe t hey have a m eaning .
fn002 [ s^ no] : But I don’t know what is t he m eaning of t ake exact ly
t his v alue .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : Yeah , it ’s pret t y funny looking .
m e018 [ s] : So t hey ’re t aking t he num ber inside t he log and raising it
t o six t een over log base t wo .
m e013 [ s] : I don’t know .
m e013 [ fg|%−−] : Yeah , I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s^ bk] : um Right .
m e013 [ s] : Six t een over [ com m ent ] t wo .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Does it have t o do wit h t hose sixt y − fours ,
m e018 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : If we ignore t he sixt een , t he nat ural log of t one over
t he nat ural log of t wo t im es t he nat u
m e013 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m e018 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ s] : Well , m aybe som ebody ’ll t hink of som et hing ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but t his is uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : It m ay just be t hat t hey [ disfm arker] t hey want t o have
[ disfm arker] for v ery sm all energies ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : t hey want t o have som e kind of a [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , t he e The effect I don’t [ disfm arker] @ @ I can
underst and t he effect of t his ,
fn002 [ qy^ d^ g] : no ?
fn002 [ s] : because it ’s t o [ disfm arker] t o do som et hing like t hat .
fn002 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : No ?
m e013 [ s] : Well , it says , since you ’re t aking a nat ural log , it says
t hat when [ disfm arker] when y ou get down t o essent ially zero energy ,
t his is gonna be t he nat ural log of one , which is zero .
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So it ’ll go down t o uh t o [ nonvocalsound] t he nat ural
log being [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So t he lowest value for t his would be zero .
m e013 [ s] : So y y ou ’re rest rict ed t o being posit ive .
m e013 [ s] : And t his sort of sm oot hs it for very sm all energies .

m e013 [ s^ am ^ cs] : Uh , why t hey chose sixt y − four and som et hing
else , t hat was probably just experim ent al .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ no] : And t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he const ant in

m e013 [ fh] : um
fn002 [ fg|qo^ cc] : Well . I [ disfm arker] I will look t o t ry if I m ove t his
param et er in t heir code what happens ,
fn002 [ s^ am ] : m aybe everyt hing is [ disfm arker] Maybe t hey t res hole
are on basis of t his .
m e013 [ s^ am ] : uh [ disfm arker] I m ean [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] t hey [ disfm arker] t hey probably have som e fi part icular s
fixed point arit hm et ic t hat t hey ’re using ,
fn002 [ s^ am ] : I don’t know .
m e018 [ fg|s^ cs] : Yeah , I was just gonna say m aybe it has som et hing
t o do wit h hardware ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and t hen it just [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ e] : som et hing t hey were doing .
m e013 [ s^ am ] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ am ^ r] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : I m ean t hat [ disfm arker] t hey ’re s probably working wit h
fixed point or int eger or som et hing .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink y ou ’re supposed t o on t his st uff anyway ,
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and so m aybe t hat put s it in t he right
realm som ewhere .
m e018 [ s] : Well it just , yeah , put s it in t he right range ,
m e018 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink , given at t he level you ’re doing t hings in float ing
point on t he com put er , I don’t t hink it m at t ers , would be m y guess ,
fn002 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : but .
fn002 [ s.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] t his m ore or less anyt hing
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|qw^ rt ] : OK , and wh when did St ephane t ake off ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : He t ook off [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s] : I t hink t hat St ephane will arriv e t oday or t om orrow .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ bu] : Oh , he was gone t hese first few days ,
m e013 [ s^ bu] : and t hen he ’s here for a couple days before he goes
t o Salt Lake Cit y .
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fn002 [ s] : He ’s [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat he is in Las Vegas or
som et hing like t hat .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s] : So he ’s [ disfm arker] he ’s going t o ICASSP which is good .
m e013 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know if t here are m any people
who are going t o ICASSP
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : so [ disfm arker] so I t hought , m ake sure som ebody go .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy ] : Do [ disfm arker] hav e [ disfm arker] Have people sort of
st opped going t o ICASSP in recent years ?
m e013 [ h|s] : Um , people are less consist ent about going t o ICASSP
m e013 [ s^ ba] : and I t hink it ’s st ill [ disfm arker] it ’s st ill a reasonable
forum for st udent s t o [ disfm arker] t o present t hings .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Uh , it ’s [ disfm arker] I t hink for engineering st udent s
of any kind , I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s if you haven’t been t here
m uch , it ’s good t o go t o ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : uh t o get a feel for t hings , a range of t hings ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : not just speech .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m e013 [ s] : But I t hink for [ disfm arker] for sort of dyed − in − t he − wool
speech people , um I t hink t hat ICSLP and Eurospeech are m uch m ore
t arget ed .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen t here ’s t hese ot her m eet ings , like HLT and
[ disfm arker] and uh ASRU [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ s] : so t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s act ually plent y of m eet ings
t hat are really relevant t o [ disfm arker] t o uh com put at ional uh speech
processing of one sort or anot her .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ fh] : Um . So .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , I m ost ly just ignored it because I was t oo busy and
[ v ocalsound] didn’t get t o it .
m e013 [ fh] : So uh
m e013 [ qy^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : Wanna t alk a lit t le bit about what we were
t alking about t his m orning ?
m e006 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Oh !
m e013 [ qr^ rt ] : Just briefly , or [ pause] Or any t hing else ?
m e006 [ fh|s^ aa] : um [ pause] uh [ pause] Yeah .
m e006 [ s] : So . I [ disfm arker] I guess som e of t he progress , I
[ disfm arker] I ’v e been get t ing a [ disfm arker] get t ing m y com m it t ee
m em bers for t he quals .
m e006 [ s] : And um so far I have Morgan and Hynek , [ vocalsound]
Mike Jordan ,
m e006 [ s] : and I asked John Ohala and he agreed .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Cool .

m e006 [ b] : Yeah . Yeah .
m e006 [ s] : So I ’m [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I just need t o ask um
Malek .
m e006 [ s] : One m ore .
m e006 [ fh] : Um . Tsk .
m e006 [ s] : Then uh I t alked a lit t le bit about [ vocalsound] um
cont inuing wit h t hese dynam ic ev um acoust ic event s ,
m e006 [ s] : and um [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] we ’re [ disfm arker] we
’re [ disfm arker] we ’re [ vocalsound] t hinking about a way t o t est t he
com plet eness of a [ disfm arker] a set of um dynam ic uh event s .
m e006 [ qo] : Uh , com plet eness in t he [ disfm arker] in t he sense t hat
[ v ocalsound] um if we [ disfm arker] if we pick t hese X num ber of
acoust ic event s , [ vocalsound] do t hey provide sufficient coverage
[ v ocalsound] for t he phones t hat we ’re t rying t o recognize
[ v ocalsound] or [ disfm arker] or t he f t he words t hat we ’re gonna t ry t o
recognize lat er on .
m e006 [ s] : And so Morgan and I were uh discussing [ vocalsound] um
s uh s a form of a cheat ing experim ent [ vocalsound] where we get
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] um we hav e uh [ vocalsound] um a chosen
set of feat ures , or acoust ic event s ,
m e006 [ s] : and we t rain up a hybrid [ vocalsound] um syst em t o do
phone recognit ion on TIMIT .
m e006 [ s] : So i i t he idea is if we get good phone recognit ion result s ,
[ v ocalsound] using um t hese set of acoust ic event s , [ vocalsound]
t hen [ v ocalsound] um t hat [ disfm arker] t hat says t hat t hese acoust ic
ev ent s are g sufficient t o cover [ vocalsound] a set of phones ,
m e006 [ s^ e] : at least found in TIMIT .
m e006 [ qo] : Um so i it would be a [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] a
m easure of " are we on t he right t rack wit h [ disfm arker] wit h t he
[ disfm arker] t he choices of our acoust ic event s " .
m e006 [ fh|s] : Um , [ v ocalsound] So t hat ’s going on .
m e006 [ s] : And [ v ocalsound] also , just uh working on m y
[ v ocalsound] uh final project for Jordan ’s class ,
m e006 [ s^ e.%−] : uh which is [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Act ually , let m e [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ co] : Hold t hat t hought .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Let m e back up while we ’re st ill on it .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : OK , sure .
m e013 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he ot her t hing I was suggest ing , t hough
, is t hat given t hat y ou ’re t alking about binary feat ures , uh , m aybe
t he first t hing t o do is just t o count
m e013 [ fh|s] : and uh count co − occurrences and get probabilit ies for
a discret e HMM
m e013 [ s] : cuz t hat ’d be pret t y sim ple

m e013 [ s] : because it ’s just [ disfm arker] Say , if you had t en
[ disfm arker] t en ev ent s , uh t hat you were count ing , uh each fram e
would only have a t housand possible values for t hese t en bit s ,
m e013 [ fh|s^ rt ] : and uh so you could m ake a t able t hat would
[ disfm arker] say , if you had t hirt y − nine phone cat egories , t hat would
be a t housand by t hirt y − nine ,
m e013 [ s] : and just count t he co − occurrences and divide t hem by
t he [ disfm arker] t he uh [ disfm arker] uh uh occ uh count t he co −
occurrences bet ween t he event and t he phone and divide t hem by t he
num ber of occurrences of t he phone ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : and t hat would give you t he likelihood of t he
[ disfm arker] of t he event given t he phone .
m e013 [ s] : And um t hen just use t hat in a very sim ple HMM
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and uh you could uh do phone recognit ion t hen and uh
wouldn’t hav e any of t he issues of t he uh t raining of t he net or
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ df] : I m ean , it ’d be on t he sim ple side ,
m e013 [ %−−] : but
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ h] : uh um
m e013 [ s] : y ou know , if [ disfm arker] uh uh t he exam ple I was giving
was t hat if [ disfm arker] if you had um onset of voicing and [ disfm arker]
and end of voicing as being t wo kinds of event s , t hen if you had t hose
a all m arked correct ly , and you count ed co − occurrences , you should
get it com plet ely right .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fh|s] : um [ disfm arker] But you ’d get all t he ot her dist inct ions ,
y ou know , random ly wrong .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean t here ’d be not hing t o t ell you t hat .
m e013 [ fh] : So um [ vocalsound] uh
m e013 [ s] : If you just do t his by count ing , t hen you should be able t o
find out in a pret t y st raight forward way whet her you have a sufficient
uh set of ev ent s t o [ disfm arker] t o do t he kind of level of [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] of uh classificat ion of phones t hat you ’d like .
m e013 [ s^ t c] : So t hat was [ disfm arker] t hat was t he idea .
m e013 [ qo^ t c] : And t hen t he ot her t hing t hat we were discussing was
[ disfm arker] was um [ vocalsound] OK , how do you get t he [ disfm arker]
y our t raining dat a .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : Cuz uh t he [ vocalsound] Swit chboard t ranscript ion
project uh uh you know was half a dozen people , or so working off and
on over a couple y ears ,
m e013 [ %−−] : and
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh sim ilar [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] sim ilar am ount of
dat a [ v ocalsound] t o what you ’re t alking about wit h TIMIT t raining .

m e013 [ s] : So , it seem s t o m e t hat t he only reasonable st art ing point
is uh t o aut om at ically t ranslat e t he uh current TIMIT m arkings int o t he
m arkings y ou want .
m e013 [ s] : And uh [ v ocalsound] it won’t have t he kind of
charact erist ic t hat you ’d like , of cat ching funny kind of t hings t hat
m ay be aren’t t here from t hese aut om at ic m arkings ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker] but
m e013 [ fh] : uh it ’s uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ ba] : It ’s probably a good place t o st art .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah and a short [ disfm arker] short am ount of t im e ,
m e013 [ s] : just t o [ disfm arker] again , just t o see if t hat inform at ion is
sufficient t o uh det erm ine t he phones .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ fg|s^ cs] : Yeah , you could even t hen [ disfm arker] t o
[ disfm arker] t o get an idea about how different it is , you could m aybe
t ake som e subset and you know , go t hrough a few sent ences , m ark
t hem by hand
m e018 [ s^ cs] : and t hen see how different it is from you know , t he
canonical ones ,
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s] : just t o get an idea [ disfm arker] a rough idea of h if it really
ev en m akes a difference .
m e013 [ s^ na] : You can get a lit t le feeling for it t hat way ,
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : y eah t hat is probably right .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean uh m y [ disfm arker] m y guess would be t hat t his is
[ disfm arker] since TIMIT ’s read speech t hat t his would be less of a big
deal ,
m e018 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : if you went and looked at spont aneous speech it ’d be
m ore [ disfm arker] m ore of one .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t he ot her t hing would be , say , if you had t hese
t en ev ent s , y ou ’d wanna see , well what if you t ook t wo event s or four
ev ent s or t en event s or t
m e013 [ fh] : and y ou know , and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : and hopefully t here should be som e point at which
[ v ocalsound] hav ing m ore inform at ion doesn’t t ell you really all t hat
m uch m ore about what t he phones are .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e018 [ s.x ] : You could define ot her event s as being sequences of
t hese event s t oo .
m e013 [ fh|s^ aap^ rt ] : Uh , you could ,
m e013 [ s] : but t he t hing is , what he ’s t alking about here is a uh
[ disfm arker] a t ranslat ion t o a per − fram e feat ure vect or ,
m e013 [ s] : so t here ’s no sequence in t hat ,
m e013 [ s] : I t hink .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I t hink it ’s just a [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ arp.%−−] : Unless you did like a second pass over it or
som et hing aft er you ’ve got your [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ arp^ df.%−] : Yeah , but we ’re just t alking about
som et hing sim ple here , yeah , t o see if [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah , yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : I ’m adding com plexit y .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : Just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ f|qo^ bs] : You know . The idea is wit h a [ disfm arker] wit h a
v ery sim ple st at ist ical st ruct ure , could you [ disfm arker] could you uh
at least v erify t hat you ’ve chosen feat ures t hat [ vocalsound] are
sufficient .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|qo^ t .%−−] : OK , and y ou were saying som et hing [ disfm arker]
st art ing t o say som et hing else about your [ disfm arker] your class
project , or [ disfm arker] ?
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e006 [ h] : Yeah t h Um .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e006 [ h|s^ rt ] : So for m y class project I ’m [ vocalsound] um
[ v ocalsound] [ v ocalsound] I ’m t inkering wit h uh support vect or
m achines ?
m e006 [ s] : som et hing t hat we learned in class ,
m e006 [ fh|s] : and uh um basically just anot her m et hod for doing
classificat ion .
m e006 [ s] : And so I ’m gonna apply t hat t o [ vocalsound] um com pare
it wit h t he result s by um King and Taylor who did [ vocalsound] um
t hese
m e006 [ fh] : um
m e006 [ s] : using recurrent neural net s , t hey recognized [ vocalsound]
um [ v ocalsound] a set of phonological feat ures
m e006 [ fh] : um
m e006 [ s] : and m ade a m apping from t he MFCC ’s t o t hese
phonological feat ures ,
m e006 [ s] : so I ’m gonna [ vocalsound] do a sim ilar t hing wit h
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] wit h support vect or m achines

m e006 [ s.%−−] : and see if [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : So what ’s t he advant age of support vect or m achines
?
m e018 [ qw.%−−] : What [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ h|s] : Um . So , support v ect or m achines are [ disfm arker] are
good wit h dealing wit h a less am ount of dat a
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e006 [ fh|s] : and um so if you [ disfm arker] if you give it less dat a it
st ill does a reasonable job [ vocalsound] in learning t he [ disfm arker]
t he pat t erns .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e006 [ fh] : Um and [ vocalsound] um
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I guess it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : y eah ,
m e013 [ s] : t hey ’re sort of succinct ,
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and t hey [ vocalsound] uh
m e006 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Does t here som e kind of a dist ance m et ric t hat t hey
use
m e018 [ qw^ g] : or how do t hey [ disfm arker] for cla what do t hey do for
classificat ion ?
m e006 [ h] : Um .
m e006 [ h] : Right .
m e006 [ s] : So , [ v ocalsound] t he [ disfm arker] t he sim ple idea behind
a support vect or m achine is [ vocalsound] um , [ vocalsound] you have
[ disfm arker] you hav e t his feat ure space ,
m e006 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ s] : and t hen it finds t he opt im al separat ing plane , um
bet ween t hese t wo different um classes ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ fh] : and um [ vocalsound] and so [ vocalsound] um ,
m e006 [ s] : what it [ disfm arker] i at t he end of t he day , what it
act ually does is [ v ocalsound] it picks [ vocalsound] t hose exam ples of
t he feat ures t hat are closest t o t he separat ing boundary ,
m e006 [ s] : and rem em bers t hose
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] and uses t hem t o recreat e
t he boundary for t he t est set .

m e006 [ s] : So , giv en t hese [ vocalsound] um t hese feat ures , or
[ disfm arker] or t hese [ disfm arker] t hese exam ples , [ pause] um ,
[ pause] crit ical exam ples , [ vocalsound] which t hey call support f
support v ect ors , [ v ocalsound] t hen um [ vocalsound] given a new
ex am ple , [ vocalsound] if t he new exam ple falls [ vocalsound] um away
from t he boundary in one direct ion t hen it ’s classified as being a part
of t his part icular class
m e018 [ b^ rt ] : Oh .
m e006 [ s] : and ot herwise it ’s t he ot her class .
m e018 [ qw] : So why save t he exam ples ?
m e018 [ qw^ g] : Why not just sav e what t he boundary it self is ?
m e006 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ h] : Um . Hm m .
m e006 [ h] : Let ’s see .
m e006 [ h] : Uh .
m e006 [ s^ no] : Yeah , t hat ’s a good quest ion .
m e006 [ %−−] : I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : That ’s anot her way of doing it .
m e006 [ b] : yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ fg|s.%−] : Right ? So [ disfm arker] so it [ disfm arker] I m ean I
[ disfm arker] I guess it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ 2] : Sort of an equivalent .
m e013 [ s] : You know , it [ disfm arker] it goes back t o nearest −
neighbor [ vocalsound] sort of t hing ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : right ?
m e013 [ fh] : Um , i i if [ disfm arker] is it eh w
m e013 [ qw] : When is nearest − neighbor good ?
m e013 [ s] : Well , nearest − neighbor good [ disfm arker] is good if you
have lot s and lot s of exam ples .
m e013 [ s] : Um but of course if you have lot s and lot s of exam ples ,
t hen it can t ake a while t o [ disfm arker] t o use nearest − neighbor .
m e013 [ s] : There ’s lot s of look ups .
m e013 [ s] : So a long t im e ago people t alked about t hings where you
would have uh a condensed nearest − neighbor ,
m e013 [ s] : where y ou would [ disfm arker] you would [ disfm arker] you
would pick out uh som e represent at ive exam ples which would uh be
sufficient t o represent [ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker] t o correct ly classify
ev ery t hing t hat cam e in .
m e018 [ b] : Oh .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink s I t hink support vect or st uff sort of
goes back t o [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t o t hat kind of t hing .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ b] : Um .

m e018 [ s^ bs] : So rat her t han doing nearest neighbor where you
com pare t o ev ery single one , y ou just pick a few crit ical ones ,
m e018 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t h t he
m e013 [ s] : You know , um neural net approach uh or Gaussian
m ix t ures for t hat m at t er are sort of [ disfm arker] fairly brut e force kinds
of t hings , where y ou sort of [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] you predefine
t hat t here is t his big bunch of param et ers
m e013 [ s] : and t hen you [ disfm arker] you place t hem as you best can
t o define t he boundaries ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and in fact , as you know , [ vocalsound] t hese t hings
do t ake a lot of param et ers
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and uh [ vocalsound] if you have uh only a
m odest am ount of dat a , you have t rouble [ vocalsound] uh learning
t hem .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , so I [ disfm arker] I guess t he idea t o t his is t hat it
[ disfm arker] it is reput ed t o uh be som ewhat bet t er in t hat regard .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ fg] : Right .
m e006 [ s] : I it can be a [ disfm arker] a reduced um [ vocalsound]
param et erizat ion of [ disfm arker] of t he [ disfm arker] t he m odel by just
keeping [ vocalsound] cert ain select ed exam ples .
m e018 [ b.%] : Hm m .
m e006 [ b] : Yeah .
m e006 [ %−−] : So .
m e013 [ s^ no] : But I don’t know if people have done sort of careful
com parisons of t his on large t asks or anyt hing .
m e013 [ s^ df] : May be [ disfm arker] m aybe t hey have .
m e013 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m e006 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , I don’t know eit her .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e026 [ qy^ rt ] : S do you get som e kind of num ber bet ween zero and
one at t he out put ?
m e006 [ s] : Act ually you don’t get a [ disfm arker] you don’t get a nice
num ber bet ween zero and one .
m e006 [ s^ e] : You get [ disfm arker] you get eit her a zero or a one .
m e006 [ h] : Um , uh
m e006 [ s.%−−] : t here are [ disfm arker] t here are pap
m e006 [ s] : Well , basically , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s um [ vocalsound] you
[ disfm arker] you get a dist ance m easure at t he end of t he day ,
m e006 [ s] : and t hen t hat dist ance m easure is [ disfm arker] is um
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] is t ranslat ed t o a zero or one .
m e006 [ fh] : Um .

m e013 [ s^ bu^ ng] : But t hat ’s looking at it for [ disfm arker] for
classificat ion [ disfm arker] for binary classificat ion ,
m e006 [ s^ aa^ m ] : That ’s for classificat ion ,
m e018 [ s^ bu] : And you get t hat for each class , you get a zero or a
one .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e006 [ b] : right .
m e006 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : But y ou have t he dist ances t o work wit h .
m e006 [ s^ aa^ m ] : You have t he dist ances t o work wit h ,
m e013 [ s] : Cuz act ually Mississippi St at e people did use support
v ect or m achines for uh uh speech recognit ion and t hey were using it
t o est im at e probabilit ies .
m e006 [ b] : y eah .
m e006 [ b] : Yeah .
m e006 [ fg|s] : Yeah , t hey [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t hey had a
[ disfm arker] had a way t o t ranslat e t he dist ances int o [ disfm arker] int o
probabilit ies wit h t he [ disfm arker] wit h t he sim ple [ vocalsound] um
[ v ocalsound] uh sigm oidal funct ion .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ qr^ bu] : and d did t hey use sigm oid or a soft m ax t ype t hing ?
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ g^ rt ] : And didn’t t hey like exponent iat e or som et hing
m e006 [ h|s^ aa] : Um [ pause] [ v ocalsound] Yeah ,
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ g] : and t hen [ vocalsound] divide by t he sum of
t hem ,
m e006 [ s] : t here ’s som e [ disfm arker] t here ’s like one over one plus
t he ex ponent ial or som et hing like t hat .
m e013 [ %−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s^ bk|%−−] : Oh it [ disfm arker] i
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , so it is a sigm oidal .
m e006 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Alright .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Did t he [ disfm arker] did t hey get good result s wit h
t hat ?
m e013 [ s^ ba] : I m ean , t hey ’re OK ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t [ disfm arker] I don’t t hink t hey were
eart h [ disfm arker] eart h shat t ering ,
m e013 [ s] : but I t hink t hat [ vocalsound] uh t his was a couple years
ago ,
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s] : I rem em ber t hem doing it at som e m eet ing ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : and [ disfm arker] and um I don’t t hink people were very
crit ical because it was int erest ing just t o [ disfm arker] t o t ry t his
m e013 [ s^ df] : and you know , it was t he first t im e t hey t ried it ,

m e013 [ s^ ba] : so [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] so t he [ disfm arker] you
know , t he num bers were not incredibly good
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s] : but t here ’s you know , it was t h reasonable .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t rem em ber anym ore .
m e013 [ s^ no] : I don’t even rem em ber what t he t ask was ,
m e013 [ s] : it [ com m ent ] was Broadcast News , or [ vocalsound]
som et hing .
m e013 [ s^ no^ r] : I don’t know .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e006 [ b] : Right .
m e026 [ qw^ t ^ t c] : Uh s So Barry , if y ou just hav e zero and ones , how
are y ou doing t he speech recognit ion ?
m e006 [ s^ fe] : Oh
m e006 [ s] : I ’m not do I ’m not planning on doing speech recognit ion
wit h it .
m e006 [ s] : I ’m just doing [ vocalsound] det ect ion of phonological
feat ures .
m e026 [ s^ bk] : Oh . OK .
m e006 [ s] : So uh for exam ple , [ vocalsound] t his [ disfm arker] t his uh
feat ure set called t he uh sound pat t erns of English [ vocalsound] um is
just a bunch of [ v ocalsound] um [ v ocalsound] binary valued feat ures .
m e006 [ qo] : Let ’s say , is t his v oicing , or is t his not voicing ,
m e006 [ qo] : is t his [ vocalsound] sonorant s , not sonorant s ,
m e006 [ s] : and [ vocalsound] st uff like t hat .
m e026 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : OK .
m e006 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Did y ou find any m ore m ist akes in t heir t ables ?
m e006 [ s^ fe.%] : Oh !
m e006 [ h|s] : Uh I haven’t gone t hrough t he ent ire t able , [ pause] yet .
m e006 [ fh] : Yeah ,
m e006 [ s] : y est erday I brought Chuck [ vocalsound] t he t able
m e006 [ s:qy ] : and I was like , " wait , t his [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] Is
t he m apping from N t o [ disfm arker] t o t his phonological feat ure called
um " coronal " ,
m e006 [ s:qy ] : is [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] should it be [ disfm arker]
shouldn’t it be a one ?
m e006 [ s:qy] : or should it [ disfm arker] should it be you know coronal
inst ead of not coronal as it was labelled in t he paper ? "
m e006 [ s] : So I ha haven’t hunt ed down all t he [ disfm arker] all t he
m ist akes yet ,
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e006 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : But a as I was saying , people do get probabilit ies from
t hese t hings ,

m e026 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and uh we were just t rying t o rem em ber
how t hey do ,
m e013 [ s] : but people have used it for speech recognit ion , and t hey
have got t en probabilit ies .
m e013 [ s] : So t hey have som e conversion from t hese dist ances t o
probabilit ies .
m e026 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : OK .
m e006 [ b] : Right , y eah .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : There ’s [ disfm arker] you have [ disfm arker] you have
t he paper ,
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : The Mississippi St at e paper ?
m e006 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Yeah , if you ’re int erest ed y you could look ,
m e026 [ %−−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s^ bk] : OK . OK .
m e006 [ fg] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ fg] : y eah .
m e006 [ s.%−−] : I can [ disfm arker] I can show you [ disfm arker] I
[ disfm arker]
m e006 [ b] : y eah ,
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So in your [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in t he
t hing t hat y ou ’re doing , uh you hav e a v ect or of ones and zeros for
each phone ?
m e006 [ %−−] : our [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ qy^ rt ] : Uh , is t his t he class project ,
m e006 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e006 [ h] : um
m e018 [ qy .%−−] : Is t hat what y ou ’re [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Right , [ com m ent ] Right , right
m e006 [ s] : f so for every phone t here is [ disfm arker] t here is a um
[ disfm arker] a v ect or of ones and zeros [ v ocalsound] f uh
corresponding t o whet her it exhibit s a part icular phonological feat ure
or not .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ %−−] : And so when you do your
m e018 [ qw] : wh I ’m [ disfm arker] what is t he t ask for t he class project
?
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : To com e up wit h t he phones ?
m e006 [ h] : Um

m e018 [ qrr^ d^ g^ rt ] : or t o com e up wit h t hese vect ors t o see how
closely t hey m at ch t he phones ,
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e006 [ h] : Right ,
m e006 [ h|s] : um t o com e up wit h a m apping from um MFCC ’s or s
som e feat ure set , [ vocalsound] um t o [ vocalsound] uh w t o whet her
t here ’s ex ist ence of a part icular phonological feat ure .
m e018 [ qrr^ g.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e018 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ fh] : And um
m e006 [ fh] : y eah ,
m e006 [ s] : basically it ’s t o learn a m apping [ vocalsound] from
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] from t he MFCC ’s t o [ vocalsound] uh
phonological feat ures .
m e006 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is it [ disfm arker] did t hat answer your quest ion ?
m e018 [ s^ am ] : I t hink so .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ no] : I guess [ disfm arker] I m ean , uh [ disfm arker] I ’m not
sure what y ou [ disfm arker] what you ’re [ disfm arker] what you get out
of y our sy st em .
m e006 [ %−−] : C
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Do you get out a uh [ disfm arker] a vect or of t hese
ones and zeros and t hen t ry t o find t he closest m at ching phonem e t o
t hat v ect or ,
m e006 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ qrr^ g.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e006 [ s^ ar] : No , no .
m e006 [ s^ nd] : I ’m not [ disfm arker] I ’m not planning t o do any
[ disfm arker] any phonem e m apping yet .
m e006 [ s] : Just [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
basically [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s really sim ple , basically a
det ect ion [ v ocalsound] of phonological feat ures .
m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e006 [ b] : Yeah ,
m e006 [ %−−] : and um [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] cuz t he uh
[ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s] : So King and [ disfm arker] and Taylor [ vocalsound] um did
t his wit h uh recurrent neural net s ,
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ s] : and t his i t heir [ disfm arker] t heir idea was t o first find
[ v ocalsound] a m apping from MFCC ’s t o [ vocalsound] uh phonological
feat ures

m e006 [ s] : and t hen lat er on , once y ou have t hese [ vocalsound]
phonological feat ures , [ vocalsound] t hen uh m ap t hat t o phones .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ s] : So I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m sort of reproducing phase one of
t heir st uff .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So t hey had one recurrent net for each
part icular feat ure ?
m e006 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e006 [ b] : Right . Right . Right .
m e018 [ b] : I see .
m e018 [ qo] : I wo did t hey com pare t hat [ disfm arker] I m ean , what if
y ou just did phone recognit ion and did t he reverse lookup .
m e006 [ h] : Uh .
m e018 [ s^ e] : So you recognize a phone and which ever phone was
recognized , you spit out it ’s vect or of ones and zeros .
m e006 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : I ex pect you could do t hat .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : I m ean uh [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ b] : Uh .
m e013 [ s] : That ’s probably not what he ’s going t o do on his class
project .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : No .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt .%−−] : So um have y ou had a chance t o do t his um t hing
we t alked about y et wit h t he uh [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ h] : um
m e018 [ qy^ 2^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Insert ion penalt y ?
m e013 [ s^ ar|s.%−−] : Uh . No act ually I was going a different
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : That ’s a good quest ion , t oo ,
m e013 [ s] : but I was gonna ask about t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
t he um [ v ocalsound] changes t o t he dat a in com paring PLP and m el
cepst rum for t he SRI syst em .
m e018 [ h] : Uh .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : Well what I ’ve been [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ m ^ t 1] : " Changes t o t he dat a " ,
m e018 [ s.%−−] : I ’m not sure I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : So we t alked on t he phone about t his , t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat t here was st ill a difference of a [ disfm arker] of a few
percent
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Right .

m e013 [ s] : and [ vocalsound] you t old m e t hat t here was a difference
in how t he norm alizat ion was done .
m e013 [ s] : And I was asking if you were going t o do [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] redo it uh for PLP wit h t he norm alizat ion done as it had
been done for t he m el cepst rum .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ h|s^ bk] : Uh right ,
m e018 [ s^ ar|s^ df^ nd] : no I haven’t had a chance t o do t hat .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : What I ’ve been doing is [ v ocalsound] uh [ vocalsound]
t ry ing t o figure out [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : it just seem s t o m e like t here ’s a um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : well it seem s like t here ’s a bug ,
m e018 [ s] : because t he difference in perform ance is [ disfm arker] it ’s
not gigant ic
m e018 [ s] : but it ’s big enough t hat it [ disfm arker] it seem s wrong .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s^ aap] : I agree ,
m e018 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ng^ rt ] : but I t hought t hat t he norm alizat ion difference was
one of t he possibilit ies ,
m e018 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , but I don’t [ disfm arker] I ’m not [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : I guess I don’t t hink t hat t he norm alizat ion difference is
gonna account for everyt hing .
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : So what I was working on is um just going t hrough and
checking t he headers of t he wavefiles ,
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m e018 [ s] : t o see if m aybe t here was a um [ disfm arker] a cert ain t ype
of com pression or som et hing t hat was done t hat m y script wasn’t
cat ching .
m e018 [ s] : So t hat for som e subset of t he t raining dat a , uh t he
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he feat ures I was com put ing were junk .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m e018 [ s] : Which would you know cause it t o perform OK ,
m e018 [ s] : but uh , you know , t he [ disfm arker] t he m odels would be
all m essed up .
m e018 [ s] : So I was going t hrough and just double − checking t hat
kind of t hink first , t o see if t here was just som e kind of obvious bug in
t he way t hat I was com put ing t he feat ures .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : I see .
m e013 [ b] : OK .

m e018 [ s] : Looking at all t he sam pling rat es t o m ake sure all t he
sam pling rat es were what [ disfm arker] eight K , what I was assum ing
t hey were ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ h] : um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Yeah , t hat m akes sense , t o check all t hat .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : So I was doing t hat first , before I did t hese ot her
t hings , just t o m ake sure t here wasn’t som et hing [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Alt hough really , uh uh , a couple t hree percent uh
difference in word error rat e uh [ com m ent ] could easily com e from
som e difference in norm alizat ion , I would t hink .
m e013 [ %−] : But
m e018 [ fg] : Yeah ,
m e018 [ s] : and I t hink , hhh [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] I ’m t rying t o
rem em ber but I t hink I recall t hat Andreas was saying t hat he was
gonna run sort of t he reverse experim ent .
m e018 [ fh|s] : Uh which is t o t ry t o em ulat e t he norm alizat ion t hat we
did
m e018 [ s] : but wit h t he m el cepst ral feat ures .
m e018 [ s] : Sort of , you know , back up from t he syst em t hat he had .
m e018 [ %−−] : I t hought he said he was gonna [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : I have t o look back t hrough m y [ disfm arker] m y em ail from
him .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah , he ’s probably off at [ disfm arker] at uh his
m eet ing now ,
m e018 [ fg] : Yeah ,
m e018 [ s^ m ] : he ’s gone now .
m e018 [ fg] : Um .
m e013 [ b] : yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : But
m e013 [ b.%] : yeah
m e013 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] I sh t hink t hey should be [ vocalsound]
roughly equiv alent ,
m e018 [ %−−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : um
m e013 [ s] : I m ean again t he Cam bridge folk found t he PLP act ually t o
be a lit t le bet t er .
m e018 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : Right .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh So it ’s [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] um
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean t he ot her t hing I wonder about was whet her
t here was som et hing just in t he [ disfm arker] t he boot st rapping of t heir
sy st em which was based on [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−] : but m aybe not , since t hey [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah see one t hing t hat ’s a lit t le bit um [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ s] : I was looking [ disfm arker] I ’ve been st udying and going
t hrough t he logs for t he syst em t hat um Andreas creat ed .
m e018 [ s] : And um his uh [ disfm arker] t he way t hat t he [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] [ com m ent ] S R I syst em looks like it works is t hat it reads
t he wav efiles direct ly ,
m e018 [ fh|s] : uh and does all of t he cepst ral com put at ion st uff on t he
fly .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s] : And , so t here ’s no place where t hese [ disfm arker] where
t he cepst ral files are st ored , anywhere t hat I can go look at and
com pare t o t he PLP ones ,
m e018 [ s] : so whereas wit h our feat ures , he ’s act ually st oring t he
cepst rum on disk , and he reads t hose in .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : But it looked like he had t o give it [ disfm arker] uh
m e018 [ s] : ev en t hough t he cepst rum is already com put ed , he has t o
giv e it uh a front − end param et er file .
m e018 [ s] : Which t alks about t he kind of uh com com put at ion t hat his
m el cepst rum t hing does ,
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ s] : so i I [ disfm arker] I don’t know if t hat [ disfm arker] it
probably doesn’t m ess it up ,
m e018 [ s] : it probably just ignores it if it det erm ines t hat it ’s already
in t he right form at or som et hing
m e018 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he t wo
processes t hat happen are a lit t le different .
m e018 [ %−−] : So .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ t ^ t c] : So anyway , t here ’s st uff t here t o sort out .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : So ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ t ^ t c] : Let ’s go back t o what y ou t hought I was asking you .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah
m e018 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : no and I didn’t hav e a chance t o do t hat .
m e013 [ s^ fe.x] : Ha !
m e013 [ s^ fe.x ] : Oh !
m e013 [ s] : You had t he sa sam e answer anyway .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fg|s] : Yeah . I ’ve been um , [ disfm arker] I ’ve been working
wit h um Jerem y on his project
m e018 [ s] : and t hen I ’ve been t ry ing t o t rack down t his bug in uh t he
ICSI front − end feat ures .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .

m e018 [ s] : So one t hing t hat I did not ice , yest erday I was st udying
t he um [ disfm arker] t he uh RASTA code
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ s] : and it looks like we don’t hav e any way t o um cont rol t he
frequency range t hat we use in our analy sis .
m e018 [ s] : We basically [ disfm arker] it looks t o m e like we do t he FFT ,
um and t hen we just t ake all t he bins
m e018 [ s] : and we use everyt hing .
m e018 [ s:s] : We don’t have any set of param et ers where we can say
y ou know , " only process from you know a hundred and t en hert z t o
t hirt y − seven − fift y " .
m e013 [ h] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ df] : At least I couldn’t see any kind of cont rol for t hat .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ na] : Yeah , I don’t t hink it ’s in t here ,
m e013 [ s] : I t hink it ’s in t he uh uh uh t he filt ers .
m e013 [ s] : So , t he F F T is on everyt hing ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but t he filt ers
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ s] : for inst ance , ignore t he [ disfm arker] t he lowest bins and
t he highest bins .
m e013 [ s.%−] : And what it does is it [ disfm arker] it copies
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : The [ disfm arker] t he filt ers ?
m e018 [ qw^ g^ rt ] : Which filt ers ?
m e013 [ h] : um
m e013 [ s] : The filt er bank which is creat ed by int egrat ing over F F T
bins .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : um
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : When y ou get t he m el [ disfm arker] When you
go t o t he m el scale .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : it ’s bark scale ,
m e013 [ s] : and it ’s [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it um [ disfm arker] it
act ually copies t he uh um [ disfm arker] t he second filt ers over t o t he
first .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So t he first filt ers are always [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : and y ou can s you can specify a different num ber of
[ v ocalsound] uh feat ures [ disfm arker] different num ber of filt ers ,
m e013 [ s] : I t hink ,
m e013 [ s] : as I recall .
m e013 [ s] : So you can specify a different num ber of filt ers , and
what ev er [ vocalsound] um uh you specify , t he last ones are gonna be
ignored .
m e013 [ s] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a way t hat you sort of change
what t he [ disfm arker] what t he bandwidt h is .

m e013 [ s] : Y you can’t do it wit hout I t hink changing t he num ber of
filt ers ,
m e018 [ s] : I saw som et hing about uh [ disfm arker] t hat looked like it
was doing som et hing like t hat , but I didn’t quit e underst and it .
m e013 [ %−] : but [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s.%−] : So m aybe [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah , so t he idea is t hat t he very lowest frequencies
and [ disfm arker] and t ypically t he veriest [ com m ent ] highest
frequencies are kind of junk .
m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ fh] : And so um
m e013 [ s] : y ou just [ disfm arker] for cont inuit y you just approxim at e
t hem by [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] by t he second t o highest and
second t o lowest .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s just a sim ple t hing we put in .
m e013 [ s.%−] : And [ disfm arker] and so if you h
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : But [ disfm arker] so t he [ disfm arker] but t hat ’s
a fix ed uh t hing ?
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ d^ g.%−−] : There ’s not hing t hat let s you [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ m ] : Yeah , [ com m ent ] I t hink t hat ’s a fixed t hing .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : But see [ disfm arker] see m y point ?
m e013 [ s] : If you had [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] If you had t en filt ers ,
[ v ocalsound] t hen y ou would be t hrowing away a lot at t he t wo ends .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And if y ou had [ disfm arker] if you had fift y filt ers , you ’d be
t hrowing away hardly anyt hing .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s:s] : Um , I don’t rem em ber t here being an independent way
of say ing " we ’re just gonna m ake t hem from here t o here " .
m e018 [ s^ 2] : Use t his analysis bandwidt h or som et hing .
m e013 [ s^ no] : But I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I don’t know ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : it ’s act ually been awhile since I ’ve looked at it .
m e018 [ fg|s] : Yeah , I went t hrough t he Feacalc code and t hen looked
at you know just calling t he RASTA libs [ com m ent ] and t hing like t hat .
m e018 [ s] : And I didn’t [ disfm arker] I couldn’t see any wh place where
t hat kind of t hing was done .
m e018 [ s] : But um I didn’t quit e underst and everyt hing t hat I saw ,
m e013 [ fg|s^ no] : Yeah , see I don’t know Feacalc at all .
m e018 [ %−] : so [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : But it calls RASTA wit h som e opt ions ,
m e013 [ fh] : and um
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But I [ disfm arker] I t hink in [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .

m e013 [ s^ rt ] : I guess for som e part icular dat abase you m ight find
t hat y ou could t une t hat and t weak t hat t o get t hat a lit t le bet t er ,
m e013 [ s] : but I t hink t hat [ vocalsound] in general it ’s not t hat crit ical
.
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean t here ’s [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : You can [ disfm arker] You can t hrow away st uff below a
hundred hert z or so
m e013 [ s] : and it ’s just not going t o affect phonet ic classificat ion at
all .
m e018 [ qy ^ t c.%−−] : Anot her t hing I was t hinking about was um is t here
a [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : I was wondering if t here ’s m aybe um [ vocalsound] cert ain
set t ings of t he param et ers when you com put e PLP which would
basically cause it t o out put m el cepst rum .
m e018 [ s] : So t hat , in effect , what I could do is use our code
m e018 [ s] : but produce m el cepst rum
m e018 [ s.%−−] : and com pare t hat direct ly t o [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ng] : Well , it ’s not precisely .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean ,
m e013 [ fh] : um , [ v ocalsound] um
m e013 [ s] : what you can do is um you can definit ely change t he
[ disfm arker] t he filt er bank from being uh a uh t rapezoidal int egrat ion
t o a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a t riangular one ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : which is what t he t ypical m el [ disfm arker] m el cepst ral uh
filt er bank does .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ df] : And som e people have claim ed t hat t hey got som e
bet t er perform ance doing t hat ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : so y ou cert ainly could do t hat easily .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But t he fundam ent al difference ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , t here ’s ot her sm all differences [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ 2^ bu] : There ’s a cubic root t hat happens ,
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s^ arp] : but , you know , as opposed t o t he log in t he ot her
case .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean [ vocalsound] t he fundam ent al d d difference t hat
we ’v e seen any kind of difference from before , which is act ually an
advant age for t he P L P i uh , I t hink , is t hat t he [ disfm arker] t he
sm oot hing at t he end is aut o − regressive inst ead of being cepst ral
[ disfm arker] uh , [ com m ent ] from cepst ral t runcat ion .
m e013 [ s^ df] : So um it ’s a lit t le m ore noise robust .

m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s] : Um , and t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s why when people
st art ed get t ing dat abases t hat had a lit t le m ore noise in it , like
[ disfm arker] like uh um Broadcast News and so on ,
m e013 [ s] : t hat ’s why c Cam bridge swit ched t o PLP I t hink .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So um
m e013 [ s] : That ’s a difference t hat I don’t [ vocalsound] t hink we put
any way t o get around ,
m e013 [ s] : since it was an advant age .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : um [ v ocalsound] uh
m e013 [ s] : but we did [ disfm arker] eh we did hear t his com m ent from
people at som e point , t hat [ vocalsound] um it uh t hey got som e
bet t er result s wit h t he t riangular filt ers rat her t han t he t rapezoidal .
m e013 [ s] : So t hat is an opt ion in RASTA .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s] : Uh and you can cert ainly play wit h t hat .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : But I t hink you ’re probably doing t he right t hing t o
look for bugs first .
m e018 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah just [ disfm arker] it just seem s like t his kind of
behav ior could be caused by y ou know s som e of t he t raining dat a
being m essed up .
m e013 [ s^ no.%] : I don’t know .
m e013 [ s^ am ] : Could be .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : You know , you ’re sort of get t ing m ost of t he way t here
, but t here ’s a [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s.%−−] : So I st art ed going t hrough and looking [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : One of t he t hings t hat I did not ice was t hat t he um log
likelihoods com ing out of t he log recognizer from t he PLP dat a were
m uch lower , m uch sm aller ,
m e018 [ s] : t han for t he m el cepst ral st uff , and t hat t he average
am ount of pruning t hat was happening was t herefore a lit t le bit higher
for t he PLP feat ures .
m e013 [ s^ fe] : Oh − huh !
m e018 [ s] : So , since he used t he sam e exact pruning t hresholds for
bot h , I was wondering if it could be t hat we ’re get t ing m ore pruning .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Oh !
m e013 [ s.%−−] : He [ disfm arker] he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] He used
t he ident ical pruning t hresholds even t hough t he s t he range of p of
t he likeli
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Oh well t hat ’s [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] That ’s a
pret t y good [ com m ent ] point right t here .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ b] : Right .

m e013 [ b^ rt ] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah ,
m e018 [ %−−] : so [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I would t hink t hat y ou m ight wanna do som et hing like uh
y ou know , look at a few point s t o see where you are st art ing t o get
significant search errors .
m e018 [ %−−] : That ’s [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s] : Well , what I was gonna do is I was gonna t ake um a
couple of t he ut t erances t hat he had run t hrough ,
m e018 [ s] : t hen run t hem t hrough again
m e018 [ s] : but m odify t he pruning t hreshold and see if it you know ,
affect s t he score .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ %−−] : So .
m e013 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : But I m ean you could [ disfm arker] uh if [ disfm arker]
if [ disfm arker] if t hat looks prom ising you could , you know , r uh run
[ v ocalsound] t he ov erall t est set wit h a [ disfm arker] wit h a few
different uh pruning t hresholds for bot h ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : and presum ably he ’s running at som e pruning t hreshold
t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s uh , you know [ disfm arker] get s very few
search errors
m e013 [ s] : but is [ disfm arker] is relat ively fast
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ fg|s^ df] : Right . I m ean , yeah , generally in t hese t hings you
[ disfm arker] you t urn back pruning really far ,
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : so I [ disfm arker] I didn’t t hink it would be t hat big a deal
m e018 [ s.%−] : because I was figuring well you have it t urned back so
far t hat y ou know it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : But y ou m ay be in t he wrong range for t he P L P
feat ures for som e reason .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : And t he uh t he [ disfm arker] t he run t im e of t he recognizer
on t he PLP feat ures is longer
m e018 [ s] : which sort of im plies t hat t he net works are bushier ,
m e018 [ s] : y ou know , t here ’s m ore t hings it ’s considering
m e018 [ s] : which goes along wit h t he fact t hat t he m at ches aren’t as

m e018 [ s] : So uh , y ou know , it could be t hat we ’re just pruning t oo
m uch .

m e018 [ %−] : So .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah , m aybe just be different kind of dist ribut ions
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : y eah

m e018 [ s] : Try ing t o t rack it down .

m e013 [ s^ ba^ t ] : I guess t his was a lit t le bit off t opic , I guess ,
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah
m e013 [ s^ df] : because I was [ disfm arker] I was t hinking in t erm s of t h

m e018 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m e026 [ s^ df] : And t hat [ disfm arker] t hat was um [ vocalsound] t rained
on clean speech only ,
m e026 [ s] : which I ’m guessing is t he reason why t he baseline was so
bad .
m e026 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : That ’s ac act ually a lit t le side point is I t hink t hat ’s t he
first result s t hat we have uh uh uh of any sort on t he far field uh
[ disfm arker] on [ disfm arker] on t he far field dat a uh for [ disfm arker]
recorded in [ disfm arker] in m eet ings .
m e026 [ fg|s^ bc] : Oh um act ually um Adam ran t he SRI recognizer .
m e013 [ qh^ rt ] : Did he ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : On t he near field , on t he ne
m e026 [ s^ aap] : On t he far field also .
m e026 [ s^ df] : He did one PZM channel and one PDA channel .
m e013 [ s^ bk|qh^ m ^ rt ] : Oh did he ?
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh !
m e013 [ s^ bd^ df] : I didn’t recall t hat .
m e013 [ qw] : What kind of num bers was he get t ing wit h t hat ?

m e026 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] I ’m not sure ,
m e026 [ s] : I t hink it was about five percent error for t he PZM channel .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Five .
m e026 [ s^ am ^ r] : f I t hink .
m e026 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : So why were you get t ing fort y − one here ?
m e013 [ qy .%−−] : Is t his [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ h] : Um .
m e026 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I ’m g I ’m guessing it was t he [ disfm arker]
t he t raining dat a .
m e026 [ s^ df] : Uh , clean TI − digit s is , like , pret t y prist ine
[ v ocalsound] t raining dat a ,
m e026 [ s.%−−] : and if t hey t rained [ vocalsound] t he SRI syst em on t his
TV broadcast t ype st uff ,
m e026 [ s] : I t hink it ’s a m uch wider range of channels
m e026 [ %−] : and it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No ,
m e013 [ s^ co] : but wait a m inut e .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I t h [ disfm arker] I t hink he
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qo^ t 1] : What am I saying here ?
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s^ t 1] : so t hat was t he SRI syst em .
m e013 [ s^ am ] : May be you ’re right .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df] : Cuz it was get t ing like one percent [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] So it ’s st ill t his kind of rat io .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : It was [ disfm arker] it was get t ing one percent or
som et hing on t he near field .
m e013 [ qy^ g^ rt ] : Wasn’t it ?
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m ,
m e018 [ s] : or it wa a it was around one .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s^ na] : Yeah . I t hink it was get t ing around one percent for
t he near [ disfm arker] for t he n for t he close m ike .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e026 [ b] : Huh ?
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ rt ] : So it was like one t o five [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s st ill t his kind of rat io .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : It ’s just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : it ’s a lot m ore t raining dat a .
m e013 [ fh] : So

m e013 [ s] : So probably it should be som et hing we should t ry t hen is
t o [ disfm arker] is t o see if [ disfm arker] is [ v ocalsound] at som e point
just t o t ake [ disfm arker] i t o t ransform t he dat a
m e013 [ s] : and t hen [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] and t hen uh use t h
use it for t he SRI syst em .
m e026 [ qy^ d.%−] : b You m e you m ean um t a
m e013 [ s] : So you ’re [ disfm arker] so you have a syst em which for one
reason or anot her is relat ively poor ,
m e026 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and uh you have som et hing like fort y −
one percent error
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh and t hen you t ransform it t o eight by doing
[ disfm arker] doing t his [ disfm arker] t his work .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ s] : So here ’s t his ot her syst em , which is a lot bet t er ,
m e013 [ s] : but t here ’s st ill t his kind of rat io .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s som et hing like five percent error [ vocalsound] wit h t he
[ disfm arker] t he dist ant m ike ,
m e013 [ s] : and one percent wit h t he close m ike .
m e026 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ qw] : So t he quest ion is [ vocalsound] how close t o t hat one
can you get [ v ocalsound] if you t ransform t he dat a using t hat syst em .
m e026 [ h|s] : r Right , so [ disfm arker] so I guess t his SRI syst em is
t rained on a lot of s Broadcast News or Swit chboard dat a .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e026 [ qy^ g^ rt ] : Is t hat right ?
m e026 [ qy^ rt ] : Do y ou know which one it is ?
m e018 [ s] : It ’s t rained on a lot of different t hings .
m e018 [ h] : Um .
m e018 [ s] : It ’s t rained on uh a lot of Swit chboard , Call Hom e ,
m e026 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ fh|s] : um a bunch of different sources ,
m e018 [ s] : som e digit s ,
m e018 [ s] : t here ’s som e digit s t raining in t here .
m e026 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e026 [ s] : O one t hing I ’m wondering about is what t his m ean
subt ract ion m et hod [ vocalsound] um will do if it ’s faced wit h addit ive
noise .
m e006 [ b] : Hm m .
m e026 [ s^ df] : Cuz I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] it ’s cuz I don’t know
what log m agnit ude spect ral subt ract ion is gonna do t o addit ive noise
.
m e013 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : well , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not exact ly t he right t hing
m e026 [ %−] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ b] : Uh − huh .

m e013 [ s] : but [ v ocalsound] uh [ vocalsound] but you ’ve already seen
t hat cuz t here is added noise here .
m e026 [ s^ bk] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s [ disfm arker] Yeah , t hat ’s
t rue .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e026 [ s^ ba] : That ’s a good point .
m e013 [ fh] : So um [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s^ bk^ rt |s^ bu] : OK , so it ’s t hen [ disfm arker] t hen it ’s
[ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s reasonable t o expect it would be
helpful if we used it wit h t he SRI syst em
m e026 [ fh] : and
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , as helpful [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−−] : I m ean ,
m e013 [ s] : so t hat ’s t he quest ion .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah , w we ’re oft en asked t his when we work wit h a
sy st em t hat [ disfm arker] t hat isn’t [ disfm arker] isn’t sort of indust ry
[ disfm arker] indust ry st andard great ,
m e026 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : uh and we see som e reduct ion in error using som e clever
m et hod ,
m e013 [ qy ] : t hen , you know , will it work on a [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] on a [ disfm arker] on a good syst em .
m e013 [ fh] : So uh
m e013 [ s^ ba] : y ou know , t his ot her one ’s [ disfm arker] it was a
pret t y good sy st em .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : I t hink , you know , one [ disfm arker] one percent word
error rat e on digit s is [ disfm arker] uh digit st rings is not [ vocalsound]
uh y ou know st ellar ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but [ disfm arker] but giv en t hat t his is real [ vocalsound]
digit s , as opposed t o uh sort of laborat ory [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ %−] : Well .
m e018 [ s] : And it wasn’t t rained on t his t ask eit her .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m ] : And it wasn’t t rained on t his t ask .
m e013 [ s] : Act ually one percent is sort of [ disfm arker] you know , sort
of in a reasonable range .
m e013 [ s] : People would say " yeah , I could [ disfm arker] I can im agine
get t ing t hat " .
m e026 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : And uh so t he [ disfm arker] t he four or five percent or
som et hing is [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] is quit e poor .
m e026 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ e] : Uh , you know , if you ’re doing a uh [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] a sixt een digit uh credit card num ber you ’ll basically get
it wrong alm ost all t he t im e .

m e013 [ fh] : So . So . Uh , [ vocalsound] um
m e026 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : a significant reduct ion in t he error for t hat would be
great .
m e026 [ s^ bk] : Huh , OK .
m e013 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker] and t hen , uh
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Cool .
m e026 [ s^ ba^ rt ^ t c] : Sounds good .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ t ] : Alright , um , I act ually have t o run .
m e013 [ s^ t ] : So I don’t t hink I can do t he digit s ,
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : but um , [ vocalsound] I guess I ’ll leave m y
m icrophone on ?
m e018 [ h|s^ aa] : Uh , yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ft ] : Thank you .
m e018 [ b] : Yep .
m e018 [ z] : Yeah .
m e018 [ z] : That ’ll work .
m e013 [ z] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ z] : I can be out of here quickly . [ com m ent ] [ com m ent ]
[ v ocalsound] [ v ocalsound] That ’s
m e013 [ z] : I just hav e t o run for anot her appoint m ent . OK ,
m e013 [ z] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ z] : I t Yeah . I left it on .
m e013 [ z] : OK .
