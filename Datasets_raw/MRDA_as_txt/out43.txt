fe016 [ z] : You were saying t hat we were wait ing for Chuck ,
fe016 [ z] : so I just [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ z] : Well , and t hen , uh [ disfm arker] t hen Morgan said " why

m e013 [ z] : Well [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ z] : OK .
m e011 [ z] : and I said " O K " .
m e013 [ z] : So t he com prom ise is we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re st art ing
but we ’re leaving t he door open .
fe016 [ z] : OK .
m e013 [ z] : So we ’ll have a lit t le m ore background noise
m e013 [ z] : and [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] Uh .
m e011 [ z] : Or we can close t he door and m ake Chuck knock
[ com m ent ] when he com es .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well , I t end t o [ disfm arker]

fe008 [ s^ rt ] : t h t here ’re a couple m eet ings where t here are a lot of

m e011 [ s] : But he didn’t shut t he door .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : I got it
m e011 [ %−] : since [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s^ t ^ t c] : Yeah . So I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] @ @ Adam

m e013 [ fg] : So .
m e013 [ fg|s^ t ^ t c] : So , uh , you didn’t [ disfm arker] you didn’t get an

m e013 [ s.%−] : I guess . We ’ve got t he usual [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ df] : Well , because no one [ disfm arker] no one ever rep

m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So I hav e [ pause] a couple of m inor ones .
m e011 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e011 [ s] : our [ pause] norm al t ranscript ion st at us ,
m e011 [ s] : just so t hat we can m ake som e [ disfm arker] som e plans .
m e011 [ qw^ rt ] : So wha what ’s up wit h IBM , Chuck ?
m e011 [ qy ] : Do you know ?
m e018 [ h|s] : Um , I t hink Brian is on vacat ion now
m e018 [ s] : but , uh , before he left we gave him , uh , anot her set of

m e018 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw] : How m any ?
m e018 [ h|qw^ t 1] : Uh , what is it ?
m e011 [ qy^ rt ] : Is [ disfm arker] is yours working t here , Chuck ?
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : Four ?
m n014 [ s] : Four .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e018 [ s.%] : Four .
m e011 [ %−] : Can y ou [ disfm arker] ?
m e011 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : You ’re b y ou ’re B ?

m e018 [ qw] : What am I ?
fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is it t urned on ?
m e011 [ s] : There ’s no on .
m e018 [ s] : Test .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : Oh . It ’s just [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ t 1] : Channel B .
m e011 [ s^ cc] : I ’ll [ disfm arker] Let m e raise t he gain on t hat a lit t le bit
m e018 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ r^ t 1] : Channel B .
m e011 [ s^ df] : since it ’s so far from your m out h .
m e011 [ s^ fa] : Sorry .

m e013 [ fg|s.%−] : OK . [ vocalsound] So we sent t hem [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : So we gave t hem four m eet ings before he left
m e018 [ fh] : and , um ,
m e018 [ s^ t c] : t hat ’s it .
m e018 [ s] : So , um , I don’t t hink we ’ll hear from him before he get s
back .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ %−] : And t he
fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : Do t hey know about your pie chart ?
m e018 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ no^ r] : I don’t know .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : What pie chart ?
m e011 [ qy ^ br^ j^ rt ] : Pie ?
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
fe008 [ s] : He has a nice pie chart on t he , uh , s t he current st at us

fe016 [ s^ m ] : Pie .
fe008 [ s] : which shows t he am ount of t ransc am ount of dat a t hat had
been t ranscribed
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−] : and t he am ount [ disfm arker] out of t he ent ire
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bu] : and [ vocalsound] at t his point it ’s not quit e half .
fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : Wouldn’t [ disfm arker] Is t hat what you ’d say , wit h t he
pie chart ?
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : And t hen of t hat , t here ’s , uh , a lit t le sliver [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I could t ry and draw it
fe008 [ s] : but it ’s probably bet t er t o describe .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Half t he dat a t hat ’s been recorded has been
t ranscribed ?
fe008 [ s^ na] : So [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] Roughly . Alm ost .
fe008 [ s^ aap] : Not quit e .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Wow ! That ’s get t ing pret t y good .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And I haven’t act ually caught up wit h , uh [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ df] : since I got back so recent ly from m y vacat ion .
fe008 [ s] : Um , I know t hat t he t ranscribers finished , um , uh , several
m eet ings while I was gone .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
fe008 [ s] : And I hav en’t t old y ou
fe008 [ s^ df] : cuz I haven’t [ disfm arker] I haven’t figured out which

m e018 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : But when t hat happens , t hen t hat pie will get even closer
t o t he m idline .

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : It ’s not quit e [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] not quit e fift y
percent
fe008 [ s^ ba] : but [ pause] really get t ing close .
m e013 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
fe008 [ s] : I t hink it will be .
m e011 [ fg|s^ t ^ t c.%−] : OK . So also , um [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ j^ rt ] : You m ean , pi will be close t o one half ?
fe008 [ s] : Well , [ vocalsound] not m at hem at ically .
m n017 [ s^ ba] : That ’s new .
m e011 [ s^ ba^ j.%−] : Now , t hat ’s a st range [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Well , if we can have t hree point one four t im es as m uch t r
t ranscribed as we recorded , we really would be doing well .
fe008 [ %−] : n
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : But it ’s a nice [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] I
recom m end his [ disfm arker] his [ disfm arker] his graphic ,
m e011 [ fg] : Um . So [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−] : You know , t his [ disfm arker] t his raises som e
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba^ df] : cuz it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s a really nice graphic .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ qw.%−] : How m uch [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ qw] : How do you t ranscribe t hat ?
m e011 [ qw] : How m uch do we need t ranscribed before it ’s wort h
doing som e t rainings ?
m n017 [ h] : Oh . B uh [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ h] : Mm m .
m e011 [ s^ bu] : I m ean , it seem s like probably we have enough now .
m n017 [ %−] : We can [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e011 [ s^ bu^ df] : Because , like [ disfm arker] like Macrophone wasn’t
t hat m uch dat a .
fe016 [ %−] : You m ean [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e011 [ s] : And it helped .
m n017 [ s] : Well , we already use it for digit t raining .
fe016 [ s^ ng] : But [ disfm arker] but t hat was read speech .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : You only used t hat for digit s ?
m n017 [ %−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : Well , we did do som e t raining on digit s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk] : That ’s right .
m n017 [ s^ bsc] : uh , rat her adapt at ion on digit s [ disfm arker] digit s .

m n017 [ s^ e] : I m ean , supervised adapt at ion .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ fh] : So .
m n017 [ %−] : Yeah . I m ean , uh [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ cs] : Maybe like t went y hours . We could t ry ,
fe016 [ s^ cs] : but [ disfm arker] Maybe not count ing t he non − nat ive
speech ,
fe016 [ s^ ba^ df] : cuz if [ disfm arker] That [ disfm arker] t hat just
doesn’t t ranslat e v ery well .
m n017 [ %−] : Well ,
m n017 [ s.%−−] : I would [ disfm arker] I would love t o do som e , um
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : you know , wit h adapt at ion y ou can use fairly sm all am ount
of dat a t o im prove y our perform ance .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n017 [ fh] : Um , and
m n017 [ s] : n you know , it ’s just basically ,
m n017 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker] uh
m n017 [ s] : You know , I [ disfm arker] I don’t have t o t im e t o
[ disfm arker] t o do t oo m uch t hese days
m n017 [ s] : except what I ’m already doing .
m n017 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s^ cs] : um , but if t here ’s som e [ disfm arker] som eone has
som e free t im e , I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’ll be happy t o show t hem how it
works
m n017 [ s^ cs^ e] : and [ pause] you can play wit h it .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Cool .
m e011 [ fg] : Um .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , I t hought you [ disfm arker] you were already using
adapt at ion w on t he t est set .
m n017 [ s^ ar|s] : No , supervised adapt at ion .
m e011 [ s] : Supervised .
m n017 [ s] : So , we ’re doing s unsupervised speaker adapt at ion .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n017 [ s^ cs] : But [ vocalsound] you could [ pause] build a t est set
which y ou sort of t ake your m odels and ada do supervised adapt at ion .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Got it .
m n017 [ s] : And t hen you st art wit h t he speaker adapt at ion from sort
of channel − adapt ed
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ s^ e] : or room − adapt ed
m n017 [ s^ e] : or what ever .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , yeah . Yeah , what ever t his is .

m e011 [ qw] : H how would you im agine doing a t est set on t his corpus
?
m e011 [ s^ e] : A t est set , t raining set division ?
m e011 [ s^ ba] : I m ean , it it ’s really weird .
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e011 [ s^ df] : Because it ’s [ disfm arker] it would be hard t o get
speaker disjoint set s .
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e011 [ qy^ rt ] : Do y do we just give up on t hat ?
fe016 [ fg|s] : Right . And act ually t he [ disfm arker] I was t hinking about
t his
fe016 [ s.%−−] : t he original applicat ion doesn’t really appl
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , if you ’re using t his ov er and over again , you ’re
gonna be t est ing on t he sam e [ disfm arker] t he sam e speakers .
m e011 [ s^ ng] : Well , but t hen you hav e t he supervised versus
unsupervised quest ion .
fe016 [ s] : I just m ean t hat it ’s not a t errible t hing t o assum e t hat you
don’t [ disfm arker] t hat you don’t have disjoint set s ,
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ fg] : So .
fe016 [ s^ e] : for t his part icular kind of [ pause] applicat ion .
fe016 [ %−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Right . [ v ocalsound] Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , you could have som e part s of it t hat are disjoint
and som e t hat aren’t ,
m n017 [ s] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s sort of like in , um , Broadcast News
m e013 [ s] : and see what t he difference is , you know , on t he ot hers .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : because you have t hose people who re − occur over and
ov er .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , t he anchor speakers t end t ypically .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ fg] : So ,
m n017 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker] m m m m
m n017 [ fg|s] : Yeah . As long as you ’re aware t hat you ’re doing t hat ,
t hat ’s [ disfm arker] I don’t see t hat as a problem .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−] : You can separat e it out and see how [ disfm arker] if
t hey ’re [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : And t hen s s sim ilarly wit h subject m at t er .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .

m e011 [ s] : That , y ou know , if you ’re t raining your language m odel on
t his m eet ing only and t est ing on t his m eet ing only , you ’re gonna do a
lot bet t er t han if you st art crossing t hem .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ aap|s.%−] : Som ewhat . Alt hough what ’s int erest ing is t hat
t he m ajorit y of t he words in t he language m odel are act ually
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Are t he sam e .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah . They ’re act ually t hese , like , funct ion words
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Sure .
fe016 [ s:s] : and " Yeah ! " and s st uff like t hat .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : And t here t here ’s a lot of speaker dependence t here .
fe016 [ s] : Ev en t he t ranscribers will say t hey know who t he speaker is
aft er a while just from t heir backchannels
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Just from word choice ?
fe016 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe016 [ s] : So y So , I don’t t hink you ’re t alking t he way you writ e , in
[ disfm arker] in ot her words .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ cs] : Most cert ainly . So it ’s just , uh , if we ’re gonna
do t hat we should [ pause] give som e t hought t o how we wanna divide
it up .
m e013 [ fg|s^ cs] : Yeah . Yeah , so , you know , m aybe som eone else
would do [ pause] a lot of t he work where probably [ pause] your adv ice
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : Yeah . And sim ilarly wit h digit s . We now have a lot of
digit s
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : would be helpful .
m e011 [ s] : but m ost of t hem aren’t t ranscribed .
m e011 [ s] : So if we want ed t o do a forced alignm ent on t hem , we
could st art collect ing ourselves up a fairly large digit corpus .
m e013 [ s^ bk|%−] : Yeah . Well , we ’d [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : And so , sam e issue .
m e011 [ s] : You know we just need t o get som eone who ’s int erest ed
in t hat t o st art looking at it .
m e013 [ s] : We want t hat for sure .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ qw] : So who ’s working on digit s current ly ?
m e013 [ s] : Uh , Dave Gelbart .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , m aybe I ’ll t alk t o him and see if he ’s int erest ed
.
m e013 [ s^ arp] : Not [ pause] right away .

m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , cert ainly .
m e013 [ s^ df] : He ’s got prelim s
m e011 [ s] : He want s t o pass t he prelim s .
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ fg|s] : Um , [ v ocalsound] one t hing , uh , uh , just a e uh , uh ,
an announcem ent of sort s is t hat , um , [ vocalsound] Chuck is gonna
be going t o a m eet ing at NIST ,
m e013 [ s] : in , uh , about a m ont h and a half , I guess .
m e013 [ s] : They ’re st ill working out t he dat e .
m e013 [ s^ df] : cuz t hey want t o gat her t oget her sort of one person
from each sit e who is involved in t he m eet ing st uff
m e013 [ s^ df] : since t hey ’re going t o be doing [ vocalsound] a bunch
of m eet ing recordings t here .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : And so , uh .
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is , uh [ disfm arker] ? Are t he CMU folks gonna be t here
?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Som ebody [ disfm arker] you know , it ’s like one person
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : at t he m om ent it ’s one person from each sit e .
m e013 [ s^ e] : So t here ’ll be som ebody from t he CMU , and som ebody
from here , and som ebody from , [ vocalsound] uh , a [ disfm arker] a

m e013 [ s] : Yeah , it ’s possible t hey ’ll open it up t o m ore people .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But [ disfm arker] but I t hink , you know , t he m ain t hing

m e013 [ s] : uh [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] uh , it ’s

m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s just connect ing wit h t hem .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Um . So , t hen if t hey st art a bunch of recordings t hen

m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] and all t hat [ disfm arker] all
t hat st uff ,
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−] : But .
m n017 [ s^ ba] : But it would be int erest ing t o hear what t hey int end t o
do about t he speaker overlap , for inst ance .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

fe016 [ qy ^ rt ] : What ’s t he plan if [ disfm arker] were we st ill going t o be
like a [ pause] cent er for t ranscribing dat a ?
fe016 [ qw] : What happens if t h t hey don’t deliver t hings unt il [ pause]
next y ear or som et hing when we [ pause] have less [ pause] resources
m e013 [ %−] : I
fe016 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s] : Well , again t he hope is [ v ocalsound] t hat , uh [ disfm arker]
I m ean , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s looking [ disfm arker] I m ean , I have t o
ask t hese folks
m e013 [ s] : but , uh , m y im pression is t hat t he , um , IBM pat h is
looking , y ou know , m ore prom ising .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : It [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] pret t y good .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And if t hat ’s t he case and if it t urns out t hat , uh , it ’s
really a relat iv ely sm all am ount of t im e
m e013 [ s] : for our t ranscribers t o process t hings before and aft er ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : if t hey really have t aken out enough of t he [ disfm arker]
of t he , uh , uh , work t hat [ disfm arker] t hat it ’s f feasible , t hen m aybe
we can do it wit h a sm aller st aff next y ear .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , [ vocalsound] next [ disfm arker] next year , uh , in
which he ’s [ disfm arker] you ’re referring t o is , uh , next year we
[ disfm arker] we don’t have a whole lot of guarant eed funding for t his
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] t his work .
m e013 [ s] : Um , ot her funding m ay com e .
m e013 [ s] : You know t hat ’s [ disfm arker] But [ disfm arker] but if we
wanna just count on , uh , [ vocalsound] uh , what we know about , it ’s
[ disfm arker] it ’s m ore m odest t han t his y ear .
m e013 [ s^ df] : Uh , it ’s st ill [ disfm arker] t here ’ll st ill be m oney ,
m e013 [ s] : but it ’s just m ore m odest .
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s^ rt ] : um , so I would see us as probably not doing m ore
recordings
m e013 [ s] : at least for [ disfm arker] for [ disfm arker] for m eet ings or
[ disfm arker] or digit s or anyt hing .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : But , uh , if [ disfm arker] if we feel t hat we need t o ,
probably st ill doing som e recordings for Sm art Kom or som et hing .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , but ot herwise just , y ou know , st op t hat
m e013 [ s] : and just [ pause] t ake what ever com es from t he ot her
places ,
m e013 [ %−−] : which ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ s] : I guess we have an u unknown rat e .

m e013 [ s^ cs] : If it [ disfm arker] if it st art s being [ disfm arker] if t hey ’re
generat ing t his huge am ount and we can’t handle it t hen , you know ,
we ’ll t ell t hem .
m e013 [ fh] : But .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Uh , alt hough it would have been nice if t hat
[ disfm arker] t heir st uff had com e earlier ,
m e013 [ s^ ba] : it it ’s in som e ways a good t hing ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : because we ’ve been [ vocalsound] ironing out t his
[ pause] pat h .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ fg|s] : Um . Well , I got a em ail from one of t he UW guys .
m e011 [ s] : They want t o record t he m eet ings at higher , uh , sam pling
rat e t han six t een [ pause] kilohert z .
m e011 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e011 [ s] : I didn’t ask why .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : But it seem s t o m e [ pause] t hat really doesn’t m at t er .
m e011 [ s] : If t hey have t he disk space t o do it , it seem s t hat t hat
[ pause] is not a big deal .
m e011 [ s] : I was just wondering if anyone had [ pause] an opinion
about m ism at ched [ pause] rat es .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Well , it ’s just if t hat t hey ’re sending it t o us , t hen we
have t o have t he disk space t o do it t oo .
fe008 [ qw^ rt ] : Can’t we downsam ple
fe008 [ s^ e^ rt ] : and , uh , t ranscribe on t hat basis ?
m e013 [ s^ am ] : That would be t he hope .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : d Are t hey [ pause] doing som e nice int eger m ult iple
m e013 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e011 [ qw^ br] : Excuse m e ?
m e013 [ qy^ rt ] : Are t hey doing som e nice int eger m ult iple of t h of

m e011 [ s^ ar] : No .
fe016 [ qy ] : Are t hey [ disfm arker] t hey ’re doing , like , t went y − t wo
m e011 [ s^ ar|s] : No . No , no , it was like fort y som et hing .
fe016 [ %−] : or s ?
fe016 [ %−] : Could [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bu] : Fort y − eight ?
fe016 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Fort y [ disfm arker] fort y − four ?
m e011 [ s] : Fort y − four ,
m e018 [ %−] : F
m e011 [ s] : fort y − t wo .
m e018 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : So , CD .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : CD − ROM .
m n014 [ s] : CD .

m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh , fort y − four point one .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : Fort y − four .
m e018 [ s] : Fort y − four one .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ %−] : S
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Som et hing like t hat .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : Oh , so t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s] : Well , you know , we record here at for at fort y − eight or
som et hing
m e011 [ s^ 2|s^ aa] : And t hen we downsam ple . Yep .
m e013 [ s] : and t hen we downsam ple .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : But fort y − eight ’s a nice m ult iple of [ pause] eight .
fe016 [ s^ nd] : But [ disfm arker] but it [ disfm arker] but fort y − four and
six t een are not easy ?
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bd^ nd] : Well you can do it .
m e018 [ s^ am ^ nd] : You can do it , I t hink .
fe016 [ qy ^ bh] : Yeah ?
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ na^ r] : Oh , absolut ely you can do it .
fe016 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : It ’s not lossy ?
m e013 [ s] : Yeah . You can do [ disfm arker] you can go from anyt hing
t o any t hing else .
m e018 [ %−] : You c y
m e013 [ s^ bd] : But [ disfm arker] but it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s just
[ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s just a lit t le m ore com plicat ed .
m e011 [ s] : You get aliasing .
fe016 [ s.%−] : As long as you ’re [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ df] : As long as you ’re not doing t he processing on t he
[ pause] downsam pled [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s.%−] : There ’s probably som e [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bu] : I m ean [ disfm arker] Just for t ranscribing it , you m ean ?
m e013 [ s.%−] : It ’s just like [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : So [ disfm arker] u u u
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Yeah . I m ean , it ’s just slight ly m ore com plicat ed ,
m e013 [ s] : but it ’s [ disfm arker] but i y ou can [ disfm arker] you can go
from any frequency t o anyt h any ot her frequency .
m e013 [ %−] : So it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qh] : Well , t he [ disfm arker] t he only t hought was if we ’re
gonna do a com bined corpus , does it really m at t er if som e ’s sam pled
at one rat e and som e ’s sam pled at t he ot her ?

m e011 [ s] : My feeling is no , it doesn’t .
m e011 [ s] : Your audio , u t hese days audio t ools t end t o t ake care of
all of t hat .
m e011 [ s^ df:s] : But I just want ed t o double check wit h ot her people
before I t old t hem " yeah , no problem " .
fe008 [ s.%−] : Also seem s like t he corpus could all be st andardized on
s on t his [ disfm arker] t he , uh [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ na] : That ’s what I was say ing .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : Why are [ disfm arker] why are t hey asking us ?
m e011 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker] so [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m e011 [ qw^ m ^ rt ] : Why are t hey asking us ?
m e011 [ s^ df] : Because , you know , we ’re sort of doing t he corpus ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : so t hey want t o be as sim ilar as possible .
m e013 [ s.%−] : A and , so I gue
m e011 [ s:s] : So . But I t hink t he answer is , if [ disfm arker] if we t ell him
" no , t hat ’s not alright " , what he ’ll probably say is " well , we ’re
gonna do it anyway " .
m n017 [ s^ ba] : It could be int erest ing .
m e018 [ s] : Well t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s why I ’m asking .
m e011 [ %−] : But , uh ,
m n017 [ s^ ba] : Well , it will be int erest ing t o find out why t hey are
choosing a higher sam pling [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ %−] : Uh .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e018 [ s.%−] : It ’s kind of a s
m e013 [ s^ am ^ cs] : Well , I would suspect it ’s because it ’s what t he
hardware does .
fe016 [ %−] : For [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ bu] : Oh , and t hey just don’t want t o downsam ple ?
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : Well , som eone ’s gonna have t o downsam ple .
m n017 [ s] : But t hen t hey ’re just [ disfm arker] t hey ’re just [ disfm arker]
t here ’s just deferring t he problem t o lat er
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : and t hey m ight sav e t hem selves a lot of disk space
problem s by doing it right away .
fe016 [ s] : They ’re t aking up m ore disk space .
m e018 [ fg|%−] : Yeah . It [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I [ vocalsound] I t hink it ’s t he sort of t hing
t hat ’s deserv ing of discussion wit h t hem .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m e013 [ s] : I d I don’t t hink it ’s like , i uh , t hey ’ll ask us , we ’ll give a

m e013 [ s] : and com e back .
m e013 [ s] : It needs som e back and fort h
m n017 [ %−] : I m ean t hat ’s wha
m e013 [ s^ ba] : because it ’s [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] it it ’s a lit t le

m e013 [ s.%−−] : And it ’s ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ aap^ t 3] : Depends what you save .
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ %−−] : i
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : You know , part of t he argum ent s for t he higher
sam pling rat e is t hat m aybe t here ’s som et hing , you know , say , in six
t o t en kilohert z t hat [ vocalsound] you m ight use for [ disfm arker] for

m e013 [ s.%−−] : If people are doing a wide range of t hings ,

uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : And t hey are gonna be using up a lot of disk ,
m e013 [ s] : bot h for t h t hem and for us when we ’re pr processing
t heir st uff ,
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s^ cs] : We should warn t hem t hat t hese disk space issues
[ pause] are gonna creep up on t hem very fast .
m e013 [ %−] : uh , if t hey
m e011 [ b] : Yep . Yep .
fe016 [ s] : They ’ll have t o st art kicking people out of t he m eet ings ,
m e013 [ s] : Well , i w wa if [ disfm arker] if t hey ’re going at fort y − four ,
t hey won’t even creep .
m e011 [ %−] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker]

fe016 [ %−] : like [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

[ disfm arker] only one person or t wo people at m ost are act ually t alking
all t he t im e .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
fe016 [ s^ ba^ fe] : Wow .
m n017 [ s^ cs^ j] : We should just t alk less .
fe016 [ s^ cs^ fe^ j] : Have short er m eet ings !
m e011 [ s] : Well , if you t alk less it does in fact use less m e d m dat a .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s.%−] : So , t he channels [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Hey , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s t he first t im e I ’ve ever heard
y ou ask for less dat a .
m e011 [ b.%] : Hm m .
m e011 [ s] : It ’s act ually one way t o t ell if a m icrophone is dead in a
m eet ing is if t he short ened file is t oo short .
fe016 [ s^ ft ] : Sorry . [ vocalsound] [ nonvocalsound] Thanks , Morgan .
m n014 [ s^ ba|s^ aa] : It ’s really short , y eah . Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Then you can be pret t y sure t hat t he m ike was off .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Uh , OK .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : And , t he t unfort unat ely t he t ablet op ones
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ba] : t he six t ablet op which we record all t he t im e no m at t er
how m any people are t here , uh , don’t com press nearly as well
m e011 [ s^ df] : because t hey ’re alm ost always have signal on t hem .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , t hat ’s probably a lot of it .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And t hey ’re gonna hav e m ikes like t hat t oo .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e013 [ s.%−] : In fact , t heir array [ disfm arker] t heir array will be
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aap] : Most of t hem .
m e018 [ s] : All of t hem are like t hat .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s] : Yep . So t hey won’t short en nearly as well .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ ba^ fe] : Wow .
m e011 [ s] : And I assum e t hey ’re gonna do it lossless .
fe016 [ fg|s^ ba.%−] : Yeah . So [ disfm arker] so t hey ’re really going t o
have a huge [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−] : So f so for dis
m n017 [ s^ cs] : for dist ribut ion purposes it m ight m ake sense t o split it
by channel , uh , rat her t han by m eet ings .

m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ cs] : So , you could dist ribut e , like , only t he near − field
signals , uh , uh , uh , t oget her for a bunch of m eet ings
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep . Absolut ely .
m n017 [ s^ cs^ e] : and t hen have a second row .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : And t hen m aybe one far − field .
m e011 [ s^ f] : You know ?
m e011 [ s^ cs] : It ’s t hings [ disfm arker] or t he m ixed channel .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Yeah , I t hink t here are a lot of way s t o do it ,
m e011 [ s^ co^ t c] : but [ disfm arker] Let ’s not worry about t hat now .
m n017 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah .
m e011 [ qw^ t ^ t c] : How are we on disk space , Chuck ?
m e018 [ s] : Um , we ’re OK .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : We ’ve got [ disfm arker] for t he , uh , com pressed
m eet ings we ’v e st ill got about ,
m e018 [ s] : I t hink it was four gigs , uh , on t he one disk t hat we ’re
using .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : And we ’ve got several [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : we ’ v we ’ve st ill got , uh , quit e a bit of space on t he , uh ,
un − backed − up .
m e018 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Good .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : But I [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s probably [ disfm arker] we
should st art t hinking about where t o go next ,
m e018 [ s] : especially on t he backed − up disk space .
m e013 [ s] : Now we bought [ disfm arker] a lit t le [ disfm arker] not all
t hat long ago we brought t hree [ pause] uh , t hirt y − six gigabyt e disks .
m e018 [ s] : That ’s t he un − backed − up .
m e018 [ s.%−] : Yeah . Those are t he u
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah , we ’re using t hose for t he [ disfm arker] for t he
ex panded .
m e018 [ s] : So , for exam ple , t he , uh [ disfm arker] Guent er ’s Wall
St reet Journal dat a went ont o one of t hose ,
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ s] : uh , som e ot her experim ent t hings t hat people are doing
are on t here ,
m e018 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : So . [ vocalsound] If y ou put it t here people will use it .
m e018 [ fh] : Yeah . So .
m e013 [ s^ bu^ cs] : So I t hink aft er t hat we need anot her , uh , rack or
som et hing .

m e018 [ s^ cs] : Hav e t o change servers , act ually .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ qw^ br^ m ] : Change servers ?
m e018 [ s] : Well , we could [ disfm arker] we could [ disfm arker] There
are a bunch of disks t hat we have , uh , t hat are s s sm aller .
m e018 [ s] : And t hey ’re , like , sev ent een .
m e018 [ s] : We could go t o t hirt y − five .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : So we could [ v ocalsound] get som e ext ra space out of
t hat .
m e018 [ s^ bd^ df] : But t he s right now t he server ’s full .
m e018 [ s] : We couldn’t add any m ore disks .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : We could [ pause] change a sm aller disk for a larger
one .
m e013 [ s] : We should probably do t hat while [ pause] we have t he
space left on t he [ disfm arker] on t he t h t he exist ing t hirt y − sixes ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : so t hat we can
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah . The problem wit h t hat for backed − up m edia is ,
uh , t he sy sadm ins wanna keep t hem at eight een m eg [ disfm arker]
eight een gig part it ions
m e013 [ s] : shuffle it around .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ df] : because t hat t akes about a day t o get off back − up
t ape .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e018 [ s] : Well , t hen t here ’s t he ot her issue is t hat t o g t o g add
m ore disk now , um , David says we really need t o go t o new servers .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ s] : But he want s t o go t o new servers not just for us
m e018 [ s] : but for ot her groups t oo .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : For u t he whole inst it ut e .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : So t here ’s t his sort of coordinat ion issue ,
m e018 [ fh] : and
m e018 [ s^ cs.%−] : I guess I need t o t alk t o him m ore about
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.%−−] : Act ually , going t o bigger disks we can do even ,
m e011 [ s] : and just m aint ain t he eight een gig part it ions .
m e011 [ s] : You just part it ion t hem int o m ult iple .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So t hat ’s probably t he next st ep ,
m e013 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right .

m e011 [ s^ cs^ e] : is t o get t he eight y or ninet y gig drives t o replace
t he t hirt y gig or an eight een gig t hat we have now .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : There are eight y gig drives now t hat you can
get for t hat ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : See , and t hat ’s probably what we should send around for

fe016 [ s^ df] : because [ vocalsound] t here ’s less dat a point s .
m e013 [ qh^ cs.%−] : Well , why don’t we d we [ disfm arker] we

m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s:s] : I ’ll [ disfm arker] I ’ll [ disfm arker] I ’ll keep saying " uh − huh

m e013 [ s] : This is absolut ely nat ural m eet ings .
m e013 [ s] : We have [ vocalsound] absolut ely no effect from our

m n017 [ s.%−] : So , we had [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] t he t ranscribers [ com m ent ] have t rouble

m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ ba] : I don’t like t he backchannels at all ,
m n014 [ s^ df] : as t hat ’s [ pause] really a problem wit h t he speech −
nonspeech det ect ion .
m e018 [ s^ aa|s^ cs^ j] : Yeah . Let ’s get rid of t hem .
m n014 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ %−] : That ’s a [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ] : Well , has anybody done anyt hing ?
m e013 [ s] : Com e on .
m e013 [ qw] : What are we doing ?
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , I ’ll st art if you want .
m e011 [ s] : I ’v e been , uh , m ost recent ly rewrit ing Transcriber in Java
for no part icular reason .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Well , for speed .
m e011 [ fh] : Uh .
m e011 [ s] : Well , I m ean , Trans − What happened was t hat Transcriber
’s very slow t o load .
m e011 [ s] : So when you have a big m eet ing it c uh , especially on a
slower m achine , it can t ake five m inut es before you can st art doing
anyt hing .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : And so I was t hinking about why t hat was
m e011 [ s^ e] : and t he dat a st ruct ures I would use ,
m e011 [ s] : and I found m yself unable not t o sit down and code it .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ e] : So I did .
m e011 [ s] : And so I have a big chunk of Transcriber now writ t en in
Jav a
m e011 [ s] : and it com es up , y ou know , in a couple of seconds .
m e011 [ fh] : Um .
m n017 [ qy ^ rt ] : u Do you t ake [ disfm arker] do you t ake feat ure

m e018 [ s^ ba] : Cool .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : Great . Great .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s^ cs] : Y y yeah . W we should t alk t o you off − line about
som et hing .
m e013 [ s^ co] : Well , wait a m inut e ,

m e011 [ s^ ba] : I [ disfm arker] It ’s not really [ disfm arker] probably not
wort h doing .
m e013 [ %−] : what [ disfm arker] ?
m n017 [ %−] : That would [ disfm arker] t h w
m n017 [ %−] : s
m n017 [ s^ ba^ nd] : Well , act ually , I t hink it is wort h doing
m e011 [ s^ bd^ df] : But we can t alk about it .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : because here ’s t he t hing . We ’re sort of [ disfm arker] we
’re st art ing t o m ove from t ranscript ion t o annot at ion .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s^ ba] : And [ pause] t he Transcriber int erface is fine [ pause] if
essent ially what y ou ’re doing is st ringing words t oget her t o p t o m ake
t ranscript s .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Annot at ing .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m n017 [ s] : But , um , in [ disfm arker] for inst ance , what we ’re doing
now w wit h , uh , Com m unicat or dat a , but which we would like t o do
wit h Meet ing dat a , is t o act ually label ut t erances , or words , or
what ev er unit s you want [ vocalsound] wit h , uh , you know , basically
doing a m ult iple choice t ype of labelling .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s^ ba] : And for t hose t ype of t asks , it wou it ’s m uch m ore
efficient t o present , [ vocalsound] uh , t he [ disfm arker] t h p present a
bunch of , uh , clickable but t ons or what ev er
m e011 [ b] : Dialogue . [ com m ent ] Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : But t ons .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ fh] : and , um [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : But it has t o be m ult i − st ream .
fe016 [ %−−] : Th − t hey [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ df] : In ot her words , t he beginning of som et hing could be
one [ pause] speaker
fe016 [ s^ df^ e] : and t he end of t hat unit , like quest ion − answer pair ,
could be a different speaker .
fe016 [ s] : That ’s why we can’t [ pause] just annot at e t he t ranscript s ,
uh , one [ disfm arker] list ening t o one at a t im e .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so t hat ’s why t he Transcriber ’s nice for
sort of list ening t o it ,
m n017 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : but y ou can’t act ually encode , um [ disfm arker] encode
som et h
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah . I un I underst and t he problem .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , exact ly .
m e011 [ fh] : So .

fe016 [ fh] : So .
m n017 [ s^ ba] : And [ disfm arker] and t h t hat ’s act ually a good m odel ,
which is what t his current t ool t hat we ’re using has , is t o at t a t o
associat e t hese [ vocalsound] labels wit h , um , at t ribut es of SGML t ags
.
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : So , you know , you have , say , a t ag for [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ no] : I don’t know [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ qh] : what t ype of ut t erance ,
m n017 [ s] : whet her it ’s a quest ion or a st at em ent or what ever .
m n017 [ s] : And t hen [ vocalsound] you have an , uh [ disfm arker] you
know , an [ disfm arker] a t ag at t ribut e
m n017 [ s] : and t he value of t hat encodes t he choice .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : So what I don’t have wit h it so far is it doesn’t play
wav efiles
m e011 [ s] : and it display wavefiles .
m e011 [ s] : I just hav en’t done t hat
m e011 [ s.%−] : since t hat [ disfm arker] t hat part wasn’t [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ bk|s^ bu] : Oh , you m ean display as in showing t he
wav eform ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e011 [ s] : And , uh [ disfm arker] and t hen also a lot of t he fancy user

m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ df] : But it works .
m e013 [ qw] : What ’s , uh , t he original Transcriber writ t en in ?
m e011 [ s] : Tcl − TK .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ qy .%−] : Are you using [ disfm arker] ?
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Which is nice and flexible
m e011 [ s^ ba^ df] : but very , v ery slow in com parison .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah . Right .
m e018 [ qy .%−] : Are you using t he [ disfm arker] ?
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , you [ disfm arker] oh , you are .
m e018 [ s^ df] : We already t alked about t hat .
m e018 [ s^ df.%−] : The XML [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] Reading
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yep , SAX .
m e018 [ s^ bk^ m ] : SAX . Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ df] : Cuz it ’s m uch fast er t han DOM and uses less m em ory .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Right . Right .

m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ s^ t c.%−−] : And t hen , uh ,
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : preparing for quals .
m e011 [ fh|s] : Uh , hopefully second week of Sept em ber if I can ever

m e011 [ s] : I probably shouldn’t say t hat on t he t ape .
m e013 [ s] : Beep .

m e011 [ s] : I got t a rem em ber t o beep t hat out .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : Who was t hat ?
m e011 [ s.%−−] : No
m e011 [ fg|s] : So anyway . So I ’ve been preparing for t hat .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ g] : Not answering your calls , huh ?
m e011 [ fh] : And , uh ,
m e011 [ s^ cs] : act ually , I want ed t o say off − line wit h you about any

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ df] : Keep m e busy .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ ba:s] : It ’s act ually not a bad idea t o say " beep " as a word
fe016 [ s^ df] : because you can search t he t ranscript s , y you know ,
for [ disfm arker] for t hat , t o find t hese places .
m e011 [ s^ 2:s] : For " beep " .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : That ’s a good idea .
fe016 [ s^ ar|s^ df] : No , I ’m s I ’m t ot ally serious . To have one word ,
like " beep " ,
m e011 [ s^ aa] : No , absolut ely . I agree .
fe016 [ s^ df] : especially wit h a really long " eee " [ com m ent ] like t hat .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s^ cs] : I ’ll [ disfm arker] I ’ll t ake t hat role anyt im e you want .
m e013 [ s^ df] : I like saying it .

m n014 [ s] : but [ pause] it ’s not yet finished .
m n014 [ s^ e] : It ’s [ pause] work in progress .
m e013 [ s^ bk|qw.%−] : OK . Any sense about how [ disfm arker] how it

m n014 [ fg|s] : Yeah . For , uh [ disfm arker] for [ disfm arker] for t he

, evaluat e t he qualit y of t he speech − nonspeech det ect ion by [ pause]

m e013 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : Right , but I was just asking if you had a sense

m e013 [ s^ bd] : m aybe you already did t his experim ent ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : where t here ’s t his quest ion of [ disfm arker] of how

m n017 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , but we didn’t hav e t he exact com parison .
m n014 [ %−] : It [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−−] : But [ disfm arker] you know , t here were [ disfm arker] i i
m n017 [ s] : t he ex perim ent s were based on different segm ent at ions
and different t ranscript s .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : So we weren’t quit e sure which [ disfm arker] whet her t he
difference cam e from different [ pause] t ranscript s , for inst ance .
m n017 [ s.%−] : And so [ vocalsound] Thilo ’s [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ fg|s^ ba] : So , it hurt s com pared t o t he ideal segm ent at ion ,
when y ou hav e t he [ disfm arker] t he m anual segm ent at ions ,
m n014 [ s^ rt ] : where you have exact boundaries for each s ut t erances

m e011 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n014 [ s] : And so I ’m just in [ disfm arker] in progress of , yeah , t rying
t o feed t he recognizer wit h un − segm ent ed dat a
m n014 [ s^ e] : and t o see how m uch worse t hat is .
m n014 [ s] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat I have t hree t hings .

and t he [ disfm arker] t he ideal one .

m e011 [ s^ ft ^ t 3] : Thank you .
fe016 [ s] : and we don [ vocalsound] you know , we ’ll do t he , uh ,
prosodic side .
fe016 [ s] : And so t his is supposed t o be a project t hat we could
act ually [ pause] int egrat e t he post eriors t hat t hey get from t heir
language m odel for every word boundary or every fram e boundary ,
fe016 [ s] : and t hen t rain up t he classifiers .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e018 [ b] : Cool .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ fh] : So .
m n017 [ fg|s] : Um , on t he recognit ion side , act ually , um , I t hink t he
m ain person doing t hat is , uh , Harriet from [ disfm arker] Harriet Nock
from , uh [ disfm arker] form erly of Cam bridge .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : Um , [ v ocalsound] and apparent ly t hey get reasonable
result s
m n017 [ s] : ex cept in som e port ions t hey get very high insert ion rat es
[ disfm arker]

m n017 [ s] : ev en higher t han we get wit h [ disfm arker] wit h t he , um
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] like even , you know , on lapel m ikes wit h ,
uh , [ v ocalsound] background speech .
m n017 [ s] : And so t hey were t rying t o t rack t hat down ,
m n017 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ am ^ ba] : It could be t hat our recognizer ’s act ually doing
relat iv ely well
m n017 [ s^ df] : because it has a reject m odel for , you know ,
m ism at ched speech , essent ially ,
m n017 [ s] : or for unspecified speech .
m n017 [ fh] : And , um , so [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Oh !
m n017 [ s] : so , uh , t hey ’ll [ disfm arker] I sent t hem our recognit ion
out put
m n017 [ s] : so t hey can sort of do a [ pause] line − by − line com parison
m n017 [ s] : and see if [ disfm arker] if t hey , um [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] you know , t heir insert ions correspond t o our reject s and
st uff like t hat .
m n017 [ s^ rt ] : So , um , we ’ll see what t hat , uh , leads t o .
m n017 [ fh] : Um .
m n017 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah . Ot her t han t hat , uh ,
m n017 [ s^ t ] : we ’re [ disfm arker] Well , t hat ’s pret t y m pret t y m uch it
as far as m eet ings are concerned .
m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , I m ean we ’re doing , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So I should m ent ion , Dave and I have sort of been [ pause]
pushing t hrough [ disfm arker] t hinking in t erm s of an ASRU paper .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But I ’m st ill [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink early next week we ’ll decide whet her we ’ll
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] we ’ll do one or not .
m e013 [ s^ df.%−−] : Um . But [ disfm arker] because , you know , t he
result s are [ disfm arker] are st ill confusing enough t hat [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] t hat , um ,
m e011 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ s^ df] : we we got t a be convinced we underst and what ’s going
on .
m e013 [ s] : But it ’s st art ing t o look like it [ disfm arker] it ’s alm ost t he
opposit e of t he usual t h sit uat ion [ v ocalsound] where , um ,
[ v ocalsound] you get som e really nice result wit h , uh [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] wit h digit s , say ,
m e013 [ s] : and t hen you go t o a large corpus and t he result goes
away .
m e013 [ s] : Um , we had what looked like a good result in digit s but t h
but t hen when we went t o m ore t raining dat a t hat kind of went away .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So , uh , t he digit s result right now is kind of equivocal .

m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : Um , but t he conversat ional speech one , while not huge ,
is in sort of Hub − five or Meet ing kind of t erm s ,
m e013 [ s^ ba] : act ually it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not bad
.
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : You know ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] So it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
[ disfm arker] you know , it ’s like ,
m e013 [ fh] : i i w
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : aft er he did som e adjust m ent s , m ore like a percent or so
t hat [ disfm arker] t hat i t h absolut e , t hat it goes [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] goes down
m e011 [ fg|s^ ba^ rt ] : Yeah . It ’s a P H
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ qy ] : But is it st ill t rue t hat basically t he s speaker adapt at ion ,
um , sort of negat es m uch of t he adv ant age ?
m e013 [ s^ am ] : Som et im es . Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ar|s] : No , I ’m t alking about wit h t he adapt at ion .
m n017 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Wit h it .
m e013 [ s] : Wit hout t he adapt wit hout t he adapt at ion is a m uch bigger
effect .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : So it so it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s v ery reasonable t o t hink of as
an alt ernat ive way [ pause] of get t ing t his kind o kind of im provem ent .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But I t hink what w ult im at ely what we have t o face wit h
it is t hat , um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , he get s incredibly good result s [ vocalsound] if you
art ificially reverberat e clean [ disfm arker] you know , close [ disfm arker]
close − m iked dat a .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : So I t hink t he t hing we really have t o face is t hat our
m odel [ vocalsound] for what ’s going on is [ disfm arker] is wrong
m e011 [ qy ^ 2^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Is it wrong ?
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : or incom plet e ,
m e013 [ s] : and t hat in t his sit uat ion in part icular t here ’s a lot of
noise .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : And noise plus rev erberat ion is not at all t he sam e as just

subt ract s it out .
m e013 [ s] : In fact [ disfm arker] in fact you can run it in sort of
enhancem ent m ode where you get speech out
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and , uh , t hen just run
it t hrough t he rest of your recognizer .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker] So , uh [ pause] um .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Neat .

m e013 [ b] : OK .
fe016 [ qw] : But if y ou have a cert ain speaker [ vocalsound] and you
wanna sort of get a bunch of dat a from t hat speaker but com pare it ,
y ou know , direct ly on a feat ure t o [ disfm arker] t o like a decision t ree
t hat won’t norm alize anyt hing for y ou once you feed it t he feat ures ,
how do y ou sort of norm alize over a part icular speaker ?
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ qw] : What kinds of [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker] what m akes
sense t o do wit h t hat feat ure ?
m e013 [ s] : Well , I ’ll have t o hear what he ’s using , f given different
suggest ions he ’s got t en .
fe016 [ fh] : So .
fe016 [ b] : i Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : But t hat ’s som et hing we [ pause] would [ pause] be [ pause]
glad t o [ pause] hav e help on .

m e013 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s^ co^ t ^ t c] : So . Go ahead , Jerem y .
m e051 [ fg|s] : Right . So I ’ve been looking at spect ral t ilt
m e051 [ s] : and [ pause] different way s of [ pause] perhaps generat ing
it .
m e051 [ s] : And , um , I basically have t hree ways right now t hat we ’re
looking at for , uh [ disfm arker] we ’re gonna look at for feat ures .
m e051 [ s^ rt ] : Uh , one is just looking at , um , t he first cepst ral
coefficient
m e051 [ s] : and , uh , using t hat .
m e051 [ s] : Um , anot her is looking at t he log ener t he difference of
log energies bet ween , um , t he high [ disfm arker] like a high −
frequency band and a low − frequency band .
m e051 [ s] : And t he t hird is just , um , t aking a slope , um , of t he
linear fit of t he spect rum [ pause] and using t hat .
m e051 [ s] : So , t hose are t he t hree [ disfm arker] t hree ways I have
right now for generat ing t hese spect ral t ilt num bers .
m e051 [ fh] : And , [ vocalsound] um ,
m e051 [ s] : hopefully soon we can look at som e of t he labelled st uff
m e051 [ s] : and look at , uh , t hese num bers and see [ disfm arker] see
which ones w seem t o be working well . And t hings like t hat .
m e051 [ s^ rt ] : Um , I also recent ly wrot e a script , um , [ vocalsound]
t hat , uh , generat es t he kappa st at ist ic ,
m e051 [ s] : um , which is a [ disfm arker] for labeller agreem ent .
m e051 [ fh|s] : Um , so , [ vocalsound] [ nonvocalsound] been looking at
t hat as well .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : I m ean , wh what [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
specifically , what you wanna do is rem ove t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he average , uh , speaker [ pause] t ilt in
som e sense ?
fe016 [ s.%−−] : The t hing i
fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah . We [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] you wanna use
spect ral t ilt t o t ry t o get at t he s n t he voice qualit y of t hese
ut t erances .
fe016 [ s:s^ fe] : So you could have som et hing like " no " versus " no ! "
fe016 [ s] : and t hese m ight differ in t hat way .
fe016 [ s] : But t he problem is we don’t know [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
t h we don’t [ disfm arker] we don’t know whet her t he " no " is frust rat ed
or not .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m .%−] : You don’t know it .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah . Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
fe016 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right . [ vocalsound] Exact ly .

fe016 [ s] : And t hen you also have t he different speakers .
fe016 [ qr.%−−] : And so , t he sort of quest ion is , [ vocalsound] do you
wanna av erage all t he dat a t oget her or do you [ disfm arker] do you
[ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : You wanna capt ure t he change in voice qualit y wit hin a
speaker ,
fe016 [ s^ cs^ e] : wit hout having t o know ahead of t im e w which is
which ,
fe016 [ s^ df] : cuz t hat would be circular .
m e013 [ fg] : I m ean ,
fe016 [ fh] : So ,
m e013 [ s^ bd^ df] : m m aybe [ disfm arker] m aybe t his is t oo obvious t o
be right ,
fe016 [ %−] : u t his is [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ cs] : but I m ean , t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t he norm al t hing for C − one would be t o [ disfm arker] t o ,
uh , get rid of t he m ean and t h and t he v ariance .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
fe008 [ qw^ br^ rt ] : To get rid of what ?
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Does t hat [ disfm arker] ? [ vocalsound] The m ean and
v ariance . Have it be zero m ean and unit y variance .
m e011 [ s] : Mean and variance .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ qy] : But do you do t his , say , just in t he vowel regions ,
m e013 [ %−] : And t hen [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ qy .%−−] : and do you [ disfm arker] ?
fe016 [ s] : a There ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s a whole bunch of , um , sort
of unknowns .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : And we can t ry all of t hem
fe016 [ s^ cs] : and just put t hem int o t he t ree as feat ures ,
m e013 [ s^ na] : Well , t he answer ’s yeah .
m e013 [ s^ na] : I m ean , you want [ disfm arker] you want it for every
place t hat ’s v oiced .
fe016 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ nd.%−] : But [ disfm arker] but you can’t do it [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ nd] : I m ean you can’t just norm alize it based on t he
ut t erance
m n017 [ s^ df] : because t hen you ’re gonna have zero everywhere .
m n017 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m n017 [ s^ cs.%−] : So you ’d have t o norm alize it based on [ pause] t he
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ar|s] : No , ev everyt hing for t hat speaker .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , OK . But t hat ’s not really feasible

fe016 [ s^ 2^ cs] : Ev eryt hing up t o t hat point .
m n017 [ s^ df] : because you ’re hav ing a sys you have a syst em , a
dialogue syst em , where you only have access t o t he [ disfm arker] what
t he speaker said before .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah ?
m n017 [ s^ cs] : So it ’d have t o be sort of a causal , uh , version of @
@.
fe016 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : Oh , yeah . That ’s OK .
fe016 [ s] : That [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he sort of [ disfm arker] w we keep
[ disfm arker] you keep , uh , it erat you keep updat ing t hose num bers
for fut ure ut t erances .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : Th − That [ disfm arker] t hat would work .
m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah . I m ean , but [ disfm arker] but t he m ain
[ disfm arker] I t hink t he m ain t hing is t hat [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ %−] : Or you c u
m e013 [ s^ bd|s] : t he [ disfm arker] You ’re right . I m ean , t he m ain
dist inct ion is whet her it ’s voiced or [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker] voiced
or not .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : If it ’s [ disfm arker] if it ’s [ disfm arker] if it ’s silence or
[ disfm arker] or unv oiced regions , t hen you [ disfm arker] you
[ disfm arker] you don’t really want t hat in t here , uh , if you can help it .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : But act ually , I m ean , just t o first order , [ com m ent ]
suppose y ou just didn’t do any t hing sm art at all
m e013 [ s^ ba] : and just did [ disfm arker] you know , did t hat , it
wouldn’t be t hat bad .
m e013 [ s^ df.%−] : Because you ’d get som e num ber t hat would be
skewed by [ disfm arker] be skewed by t hat [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bu] : So y ou m ean , you ’re just [ pause] using a m ean and
t he v arian and a v ariance ?
m e013 [ s|s^ aa] : You know , uh , uh , X − X [ disfm arker] X [ disfm arker]
X − X [ disfm arker] X m inus m u over sigm a . Yeah .
fe016 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : You m ean just a [ disfm arker] a Z − square ,
fe016 [ %−] : like ?
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Right , right . Right . OK .
fe016 [ s|s^ bk] : So it is dist ribut ed [ pause] in a way t hat you can do
t his . Yeah . OK .
m n017 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : It [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s sort of
t he first − order t hing t o do .
m e013 [ s] : There ’s , uh , you know , uh , obviously m uch [ disfm arker]
m uch m ore arcane t hings t o do and com plicat ed t hings t o do .
fe016 [ fg|s] : OK . So , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] so [ disfm arker] t hat was our
sort of [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : But t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t h t hat ’s t he first t hing t o do .

fe016 [ s] : m aybe t his will work ,
fe016 [ s^ bd^ no] : I don’t know .
m e013 [ s:s] : And t hen [ disfm arker] you know , t hen [ vocalsound] t he
next t hing is , " well , let ’s just look at t he voiced regions " ,
fe016 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : y ou know , and t hat would be a reasonable t hing t o do .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t hen if it ’s really [ disfm arker] when you look at
what y i i i
m e013 [ s^ ba^ cs] : Since you ’re looking at som et hing t hat ’s sort of in
log dom ain , cepst ral is like log d linearly t ransform ed of a log dom ain ,
[ com m ent ] [ v ocalsound] it ’s probably not t hat t errible an assum pt ion
t o pret end it ’s Gaussian anyway .
m e013 [ s] : And so t he ot her t hings t hat get m ore [ disfm arker] m ore
t ricky are , [ vocalsound] uh , t o handle t he fact t hat it ’s not
[ disfm arker] not really Gaussian .
m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and y you m ay [ disfm arker] you m ay not
really need t hat for t his .
fe016 [ s|s^ aa] : Well , we probably won’t get t hat far . Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s^ cs] : Yeah . So I t hink t hat would be [ disfm arker] t hat
would be t he obvious t hing t o do .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ b] : OK .
m n017 [ s^ bu] : Well , we ’re not gonna build a param et ric m odel of t he
[ disfm arker] o o of t he [ disfm arker] of t he feat ure .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ qy^ d^ g] : Right ?
m n017 [ s] : We ’re just gonna [ disfm arker] we we ’re gonna use
[ v ocalsound] like t hresholding or som et hing .
m e013 [ s^ ar|s] : No , I underst and .
m e013 [ s.%−] : It ’s just [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ cs] : No , it ’s m ore t hat [ disfm arker] t hat if you felt
som et hing wasn’t Gaussian and you were t rying t o [ pause] norm alize
for som e kind of , uh , bias of som e sort , you m ight use a non −
param et ric [ vocalsound] m easure ,
m n017 [ b] : Right , right . OK .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : like you m ight use a m edian ,
fe016 [ s^ 2|s^ aa] : m Median , yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ f] : you know ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : and rank st at ist ics , and all t hat sort of st uff .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : We could just plot [ disfm arker] plot t hese for a speaker
,
m e013 [ s^ co] : But I m ean , you shouldn’t bot her wit h it if it ’s roughly
Gaussian .
fe016 [ fh] : and
fe016 [ s^ cs^ e] : get a bunch of hist ogram s .

m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ %−−] : Just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : OK .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ b] : Uh , y eah .
fe016 [ s^ ft ] : Thanks .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Sure .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Uh , and I already [ disfm arker] I already said what
[ pause] I was doing ,
m e013 [ s] : which is [ pause] m ost ly t rying t o give advice t o Dave when
he [ disfm arker] he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] he act ually does t he real
[ v ocalsound] work on t his , uh , reverberat ion t hing .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : But I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s a real
, uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] it ’s a real learning experience for bot h
of us .
m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and , uh , I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s a
problem [ pause] ar [ com m ent ] problem area t hat people really haven’t
dealt wit h t hat m uch , as we know .
m e013 [ s] : So , [ v ocalsound] uh , w h he kind of did [ disfm arker] he
st art ed off wit h what was [ vocalsound] in som e sense sort of t he first
obvious t hing t o do ,
m e013 [ s] : alt hough [ pause] hardly anybody had done it yet .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : And , uh , it [ disfm arker] it does work very well under
som e condit ions
m e013 [ s] : and ot her condit ions it doesn’t .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And now we ’re underst anding [ disfm arker] t rying t o
underst and what t hose are .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : It − it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s fun .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Do you want t o add som e anyt hing ? [ disfm arker] t o
say anyt hing ?
m e011 [ s] : She just got back .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : How was y Did you cat ch fish ,
m e013 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
fe008 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m |s^ bk] : No . [ vocalsound] No fish . OK .
fe008 [ s^ aa^ m ] : No .
m e013 [ s] : You know , when Bush cat ches fish
m e013 [ s] : t hey act ually put a bunch of fish in t he lake for him .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
fe016 [ s^ 2^ j] : Really s really hungry fish .
m e018 [ s] : It ’s [ pause] part of t he budget .
m e013 [ s] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m not kidding .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : Really . They just [ disfm arker] t hey [ disfm arker] t hey

m e013 [ s^ r] : I ’m really not kidding .
m e018 [ %−] : How t hey [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ d^ j^ rt ] : They got , like , scuba gear on and , like ,

fe016 [ s] : It ’s already dead .
m e013 [ fg|s^ rt ] : Yeah . [ vocalsound] So we ’re [ pause] ready t o
increase our federal funding .
m e011 [ s^ t ^ t c] : I t hink we ’re done .
m e011 [ qy^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : Should we do , uh , sim ult aneous digit s so t hat
we act ually hav e t im e for t ea ?
m e013 [ qh.%−−] : Why [ disfm arker] why don’t we ?
m n017 [ b] : OK .
