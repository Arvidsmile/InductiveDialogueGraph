by next [ disfm arker] next Tuesday or so .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e013 [ s] : So he ’s [ disfm arker] he ’s going t o be here for about
t hree weeks ,
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Oh !
m n052 [ s^ ba] : That ’s nice .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : Just for a visit ?
m e013 [ fh] : and ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ h|s^ am ] : Uh , we ’ll see .
m e013 [ s^ df] : We m ight [ disfm arker] m ight end up wit h som e longer
collaborat ion or som et hing .
m e018 [ b] : Huh .
m e013 [ s] : So he ’s gonna look in on everyt hing we ’re doing
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Cool .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : and giv e us his [ disfm arker] his t hought s .
m e013 [ s] : And so it ’ll be anot her [ disfm arker] anot her good person
looking at t hings .
m n052 [ b] : Oh .
m n052 [ b] : Hm m .
m e026 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : Th − t hat ’s his spect ral subt ract ion group ?
m e026 [ qy ] : Is t hat right ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e026 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e013 [ s^ aa^ r] : yeah .
m e026 [ qy^ cs^ d^ rt ] : So I guess I should probably t alk t o him a bit
t oo ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Oh , yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : No , he ’ll be around for t hree weeks .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : He ’s , uh , um , very , very , easygoing ,
m e013 [ s^ ba] : easy t o t alk t o ,
m e013 [ s^ ba] : and , uh , very int erest ed in everyt hing .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Really nice guy .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s^ aa^ r] : y eah .
m n052 [ fg|s] : Yeah , we m et him in Am st erdam .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : yeah , he ’s been here before .

m e013 [ s.%−] : I m ean , he ’s [ disfm arker] he ’s [ disfm arker] he ’s
[ disfm arker] he ’s [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n052 [ s] : I haven’t not iced him .
m e018 [ s] : Wh − Back when I was a grad st udent he was here for a ,
uh , uh [ disfm arker] a year or [ com m ent ] n six m ont hs .
m e013 [ s] : N nine m ont hs .
m e018 [ s] : Som et hing like t hat .
m e013 [ s] : Som et hing like t hat .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : He ’s [ disfm arker] he ’s done a couple st ays here .
m n052 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fg|s^ t c] : So , um , [ vocalsound] [ com m ent ] I guess we got
lot s t o cat ch up on .
m e018 [ s^ df] : And we haven’t m et for a couple of weeks .
m e018 [ s] : We didn’t m eet last week , Morgan .
m e018 [ fh|s] : Um , I went around and t alked t o everybody ,
m e018 [ s] : and it seem ed like t hey [ disfm arker] t hey had som e new
result s
m e018 [ s] : but rat her t han t hem com ing up and t elling m e I figured we
should just wait a week and t hey can t ell bot h [ disfm arker] you know ,
all of us .
m e018 [ fh] : So , um ,
m e018 [ qw^ co] : why don’t we [ disfm arker] why don’t we st art wit h you
, Dav e ,
m e026 [ s^ aa] : Oh , OK .
m e018 [ s^ co] : and t hen , um , we can go on .
m e018 [ fh] : So .
m e026 [ fg|s] : So , um , since we ’re looking at put t ing t his , um
[ disfm arker] m ean log m m agnit ude spect ral subt ract ion , um , int o t he
Sm art Kom sy st em , I I did a t est seeing if , um , it would work using
past only [ com m ent ] and plus t he present t o calculat e t he m ean .
m e026 [ s] : So , I did a t est , um , [ v ocalsound] where I used t welve
seconds from t he past and t he present fram e t o , um , calculat e t he
m ean .
m e026 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Twelve seconds [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu] : Twelve [ disfm arker] t welve seconds back from t he
current [ pause] fram e ,
m e026 [ h] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : is t hat what you m ean ?
m e026 [ s^ na] : Twelv e seconds , um , count ing back from t he end of
t he current fram e ,

m e026 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e026 [ s] : So it was , um , t wen I t hink it was t went y − one fram es
m e018 [ s^ bk^ r] : OK .
m e026 [ s] : and t hat worked out t o about t welve seconds .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e026 [ s^ rt ] : And com pared t o , um , do using a t welve second
cent ered window , I t hink t here was a drop in perform ance
m e026 [ s] : but it was just a slight drop .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Hm m !
m e026 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is [ disfm arker] is t hat right ?
m e013 [ h] : Um ,
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : yeah , I m ean , it was pret t y [ disfm arker] it was
pret t y t iny .
m e026 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e026 [ s] : So t hat was encouraging .
m e026 [ fh] : And , um ,
m e026 [ s^ e] : t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] um , t hat ’s
encouraging for [ disfm arker] for t he idea of using it in an int eract ive
sy st em like
m e026 [ fh|s] : And , um , anot her issue I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m t hinking
about is in t he Sm art Kom syst em .
m e026 [ s] : So say t we t welve seconds in t he earlier t est seem ed like a
good lengt h of t im e ,
m e026 [ qw] : but what happens if y ou hav e less t han t welve seconds ?
m e026 [ fh] : And , um [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s] : So I w bef before , um [ disfm arker] Back in May , I did som e
ex perim ent s using , say , t wo seconds , or four seconds , or six
seconds .
m e026 [ s] : In t hose I t rained t he m odels using m ean subt ract ion wit h
t he m eans calculat ed over t wo seconds , or four seconds , or six
seconds .
m e026 [ fh] : And , um ,
m e026 [ s] : here , I was curious , what if I t rained t he m odels using
t welve seconds
m e026 [ s] : but I f I gave it a sit uat ion where t he t est set I was
[ disfm arker] subt ract ed using t wo seconds , or four seconds , or six
seconds .
m e026 [ fh] : And , um [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s] : So I did t hat for about t hree different condit ions .
m e026 [ fh] : And , um [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , I t h I t hink it was , um , four se
m e026 [ s^ r] : I t hink [ disfm arker] I t hink it was , um , som et hing like
four seconds and , um , six seconds , and eight seconds .

m e026 [ s] : Som et hing like t hat .
m e026 [ s] : And it seem s like it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it hurt s
com pared t o if y ou act ually t rain t he m odels [ com m ent ] using t h t hat
sam e lengt h of t im e
m e026 [ s^ df] : but it [ disfm arker] it doesn’t hurt t hat m uch .
m e026 [ fh] : Um ,
m e026 [ s^ e] : u usually less t han point fiv e percent ,
m e026 [ s^ rt ] : alt hough I t hink I did see one where it was a point eight
percent or so rise in word error rat e .
m e026 [ s^ df] : But t his is , um , w where , um , even if I t rain on t he ,
uh , m odel , and m ean subt ract ed it wit h t he sam e lengt h of t im e as in
t he t est , it [ disfm arker] t he word error rat e is around , um , t en
percent or nine percent .
m e026 [ s^ df] : So it doesn’t seem like t hat big a d a difference .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : But it [ disfm arker] but looking at it t he ot her way , isn’t
it [ disfm arker] what you ’re say ing t hat it didn’t help you t o have t he
longer t im e for t raining ,
m e013 [ s^ e.%−−] : if you were going t o have a short t im e for
[ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s^ aa] : That [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t rue .
m e026 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ qw] : I m ean , why would you do it , if you knew t hat you were
going t o hav e short windows in t est ing .
m e026 [ %] : Wa
m e018 [ s] : Yeah , it seem s like for y our [ disfm arker] I m ean , in norm al
sit uat ions you would never get t welve seconds of speech ,
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n052 [ s|qy^ d^ g] : You need t welve seconds in t he past t o est im at e ,
right ?
m e018 [ %−] : I ’m not [ disfm arker] e u
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ qrr.%−−] : Or l or you ’re looking at six sec [ disfm arker] seconds
in fut ure and six in [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s.%−] : Um , t t welve s
m e026 [ s^ nd] : N n uh [ disfm arker] For t he t est it ’s just t welve
seconds in t he past .
m e013 [ s^ ar|s] : No , t ot al .
m n052 [ s] : No , it ’s all [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Is t his t welve seconds of [ disfm arker] uh , regardless
of speech or silence ?
m e018 [ qrr] : Or t welve seconds of speech ?
m e026 [ s] : Of [ disfm arker] of speech .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ s] : The ot her t hing , um , which m aybe relat es a lit t le bit t o
som et hing else we ’ve t alked about in t erm s of windowing and so on is
, t hat , um , I wonder if you t rained wit h t welve seconds , and t hen
when y ou were t wo seconds in you used t wo seconds ,
m e013 [ s] : and when you were four seconds in , you used four
seconds ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and when you were six [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : and y ou basically build up t o t he t welve seconds .
m e013 [ s] : So t hat if you have very long ut t erances you have t he best
,
m e026 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : but if y ou have short er ut t erances you use what you can .
m e026 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e026 [ s] : And t hat ’s act ually what we ’re planning t o do in
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m e026 [ %−−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e026 [ s] : s so I g So I guess t he que t he quest ion I was t rying t o get
at wit h t hose ex perim ent s is , " does it m at t er what m odels you use ?
m e026 [ s^ e] : Does it m at t er how m uch t im e y you use t o calculat e
t he m ean when you were , um , t ra doing t he t raining dat a ? "
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But I m ean t he ot her t hing is t hat t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , t he ot her way of looking at t his , going back t o ,
uh , m ean cepst ral subt ract ion versus RASTA kind of t hings , is t hat
y ou could look at m ean cepst ral subt ract ion ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : especially t he way you ’re doing it , uh , as being a kind
of filt er .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : And so , t he ot her t hing is just t o design a filt er .
m e013 [ s^ df] : You know , basically you ’re [ disfm arker] you ’re
[ disfm arker] you ’re doing a high − pass filt er or a band − pass filt er of
som e sort
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and just design a filt er .
m e013 [ s^ df] : And t hen , you know , a filt er will have a cert ain
behav ior
m e013 [ s^ df] : and y ou loo can look at t he st art up behavior when you
st art up wit h not hing .
m e026 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and , y ou know , it will , uh , if you hav e an
IIR filt er for inst ance , it will , um , uh , not behave in t he st eady − st at e
way t hat y ou would like it t o behav e unt il y ou get a long enough period
,
m e013 [ fh] : but , um ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,

m e013 [ s] : by just const raining y ourself t o have your filt er be only a
subt ract ion of t he m ean , you ’re kind of , you know , t ying your hands
behind your back
m e013 [ s^ df] : because t here ’s [ disfm arker] filt ers have all sort s of be
t em poral and spect ral behaviors .
m e026 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And t he only t hing , you know , consist ent t hat we know
about is t hat y ou want t o get rid of t he very low frequency com ponent .
m e026 [ b] : Hm m .
m n052 [ qy] : But do you really want t o calculat e t he m ean ?
m n052 [ qr^ d] : And you neglect all t he silence regions [ com m ent ] or
y ou just use ev ery t hing t hat ’s t welve seconds ,
m n052 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ h] : Um ,
m e026 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : you [ disfm arker] do you m ean in m y t est s so far ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Ye − yeah .
m e026 [ s] : Most of t he silence has been cut out .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e026 [ s] : Just [ disfm arker] There ’s just int er − word silences .
m n052 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : And t hey are , like , pret t y short .
m e026 [ s^ 2] : Pret t y short .
m n052 [ %−−] : Shor
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e026 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : So you really need a lot of speech t o est im at e t he m ean of
it .
m e026 [ h|s^ ng] : Well , if I only use six seconds , it st ill works pret t y
well .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e026 [ s^ df] : I saw in m y t est before .
m e026 [ s^ df] : I was t rying t welve seconds cuz t hat was t he best
[ pause] in m y t est before
m n052 [ b] : OK .
m e026 [ s^ df] : and t hat increasing past t welve seconds didn’t seem t o
help .
m n052 [ b] : Hm m .
m n052 [ b] : Huh .
m e026 [ fh] : t h um , yeah ,
m e026 [ s] : I guess it ’s som et hing I need t o play wit h m ore t o decide
how t o set t hat up for t he Sm art Kom syst em .

m e026 [ s^ cs^ e.%−−] : Like , m ay m aybe if I t rained on six seconds it
would work bet t er when I only had t wo seconds or four seconds , and
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : And , um [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : Yeah , and again , if you t ake t his filt ering
perspect ive and if you essent ially have it build up over t im e .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , if you com put ed m eans over t wo and t hen over
four , and over six , essent ially what y ou ’re get t ing at is a kind of , uh ,
ram p up of a filt er anyway .
m e013 [ s] : And so y ou m ay [ disfm arker] m ay just want t o t hink of it as
a filt er .
m e013 [ s] : But , uh , if you do t hat , t hen , um , in pract ice som ebody
using t he Sm art Kom syst em , one would t hink [ com m ent ] [ disfm arker]
if t hey ’re using it for a while , it m eans t hat t heir first ut t erance ,
inst ead of , you know , get t ing , uh , a fort y percent error rat e
reduct ion , t hey ’ll get a [ disfm arker] uh , over what , uh , you ’d get
wit hout t his , uh , um , policy , uh , you get t hirt y percent .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen t he second ut t erance t hat you give , t hey get
t he full [ disfm arker] you know , uh , full benefit of it if it ’s t his ongoing
t hing .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh ,
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : so you [ disfm arker] you cache t he ut t erances ?
m e018 [ s^ bu.%−−] : That ’s how you get your ,
m e018 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ %] : M
m e013 [ s^ na] : Well , I ’m saying in pract ice , yeah ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Ah .
m e013 [ s^ df] : t hat ’s [ disfm arker] If som ebody ’s using a syst em t o
ask for direct ions or som et hing ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ df] : you know , t hey ’ll say som et hing first .
m e013 [ s:qw] : And [ disfm arker] and t o begin wit h if it doesn’t get
t hem quit e right , m a m m aybe t hey ’ll com e back and say , " excuse
me ? "
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ %−−] : or som e [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean it should have som e policy like t hat anyway .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker] and , uh ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh , in any event t hey m ight ask a second quest ion .

m e013 [ s] : And it ’s not like what he ’s doing doesn’t , uh , im prove
t hings .
m e013 [ s] : It does im prove t hings ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : just not as m uch as he would like .
m e013 [ fh|s] : And so , uh , t here ’s a higher probabilit y of it m aking an
error , uh , in t he first ut t erance .
m e018 [ s^ cs.%−−] : What would be really cool is if you could have
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bd] : uh , t his probably [ disfm arker] users would never like
t his [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ cs] : but if you had [ disfm arker] could have a syst em where
, [ v ocalsound] before t hey began t o use it t hey had t o int roduce
t hem selves , verbally .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ fh] : You know .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s:s] : " Hi ,
m e018 [ s:s] : m y nam e is so − and − so ,
m e018 [ s:s] : I ’m from blah − blah − blah . "
m e018 [ s^ df] : And you could use t hat init ial speech t o do all t hese

m e026 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Oh , t he ot her t hing I guess which [ disfm arker] which ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ s^ no] : I don’t know m uch about [ disfm arker] as m uch as I
should about t he rest of t he syst em
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker] but , um ,
m e013 [ qy^ cs.%−−] : couldn’t y ou , uh , if you [ disfm arker] if you sort of
did a first pass
m e013 [ s^ no] : I don’t know what kind of , uh , uh , capabilit y we have
at t he m om ent for [ disfm arker] for doing second passes on
[ disfm arker] on , uh , uh , som e kind of lit t le [ disfm arker] sm all lat t ice ,
or a graph , or confusion net work , or som et hing .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But if you did first pass wit h , um , t he [ disfm arker] wit h
[ disfm arker] eit her wit hout t he m ean sub subt ract ion or wit h a
[ disfm arker] a v ery short t im e one ,
m e013 [ s] : and t hen , um , once you , uh , act ually had t he whole

based on everyt hing t hat you had , um , and t hen at t hat point only
used it t o dist inguish bet ween , y ou know , t op N , um , possible

m ight not t ake very m uch t im e .

m e013 [ s] : I m ean , I know in t he large v ocabulary st u uh , uh ,
sy st em s , people were evaluat ing on in t he past , som e people really
pushed every t hing in t o m ake it in one pass
m e013 [ s] : but ot her people didn’t and had m ult iple passes .
m e013 [ fh] : And , um ,
m e013 [ s:s] : t he argum ent , um , against m ult iple passes was u u has
oft en been " but we want t o t his t o be r you know [ disfm arker] have a

m e013 [ s:s^ bk] : And t he count erargum ent t o t hat which , say , uh ,
BBN I t hink had , [ com m ent ] was " yeah ,
m e013 [ s:s] : but our second responses are [ disfm arker] second , uh ,

m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|qh] : So , um , if [ disfm arker] if your second pass t akes a
m illisecond who cares ?
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e026 [ fg] : S so , um ,
m e026 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : t he [ disfm arker] t he idea of t he second pass
would be wait ing t ill y ou have m ore recorded speech ?
m e026 [ qrr.%−−] : Or [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : so if it t urned out t o be a problem , t hat you didn’t have
enough speech because you need a longer [ disfm arker] longer window
t o do t his processing , t hen , uh , one t act ic is [ disfm arker] you know ,
looking at t he larger syst em and not just at t he front − end st uff
[ com m ent ] [ disfm arker] is t o t ake in , um , t he speech wit h som e

m e013 [ s] : And t hen t he decoding of t hat is m uch , m uch fast er or
can be m uch , m uch fast er if it isn’t a big bushy net work .
m e013 [ s] : And you can decode t hat now wit h speech t hat you ’ve
act ually processed using t his longer t im e , uh , subt ract ion .
m e026 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s^ df] : So I m ean , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s com m on t hat people
do t his sort of t hing where t hey do m ore t hings t hat are m ore com plex
or require looking ov er m ore t im e , what ever , in som e kind of second
pass .
m e026 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e026 [ b] : OK .

m e013 [ fh|s] : um , and again , if t he second pass is really , really fast
[ disfm arker] Uh , anot her one I ’ve heard of is [ disfm arker] is in
[ disfm arker] in connect ed digit st uff , um , going back and l and
t hrough backt race and finding regions t hat are considered t o be a d a
digit , but , uh , which have very low energy .
m e026 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e026 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ fh|s] : So , uh [ disfm arker] I m ean , t here ’s lot s of t hings you
can do in second passes , at all sort s of lev els .
m e013 [ s] : Any way , I ’m t hrowing t oo m any t hings out .
m e013 [ fh] : But .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : So is t hat , uh [ disfm arker] t hat it ?
m e026 [ s^ na] : I guess t hat ’s it .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e018 [ fh|qy^ co^ rt ^ t c] : uh , do you wanna go , Sunil ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m n052 [ fh] : Um , so ,
m n052 [ s.%−−] : t he last t wo weeks was , like [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : So I ’ve been working on t hat Wiener filt ering .
m n052 [ fh] : And ,
m n052 [ fh] : uh ,
m n052 [ s] : found t hat , uh , s single [ disfm arker] like , I just do a s
norm al Wiener filt ering , like t he st andard m et hod of Wiener filt ering .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : And t hat doesn’t act ually give m e any im provem ent
ov er like [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : I m ean , uh , b it act ually im proves over t he baseline
m n052 [ s] : but it ’s not like [ disfm arker] it doesn’t m eet som et hing like
fift y percent or som et hing .
m n052 [ s.%−] : So , I ’ve been play ing wit h t he v
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Im proves over t he base line MFCC syst em ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yeah .
m n052 [ fh] : So , um [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker] The im provem ent is som ewhere
around , like , t hirt y percent over t he baseline .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t hat using [ disfm arker] in com binat ion wit h
som et hing else ?
m n052 [ s^ ar] : No ,
m e013 [ s^ e.%−] : Wit h [ disfm arker] wit h a [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ nd] : just [ disfm arker] just one st age Wiener filt er
m n052 [ s^ e] : which is a st andard Wiener filt er .
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No , no ,
m e013 [ qr^ rt ] : but I m ean in com binat ion wit h our on − line
norm alizat ion or wit h t he LDA ?

m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
m n052 [ s] : So I just plug in t he Wiener filt ering .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , in t he s in our syst em , where [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n052 [ s.%−] : So , I di i di
m e013 [ fg|qy^ rt ] : So , does it g does t hat m ean it get s worse ?
m e013 [ qrr.%−−] : Or [ disfm arker] ?
m n052 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n052 [ s^ df^ nd] : It act ually im prov es over t he baseline of not having
a Wiener filt er in t he whole syst em .
m n052 [ s^ e] : Like I have an LDA f LDA plus on − line norm alizat ion ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ?
m n052 [ s] : and t hen I plug in t he Wiener filt er in t hat ,
m n052 [ s^ nd] : so it im proves over not having t he Wiener filt er .
m n052 [ s^ nd] : So it im proves
m n052 [ s^ df] : but it [ disfm arker] it doesn’t t ake it like be beyond like
t hirt y percent ov er t he baseline .
m n052 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : But t hat ’s what I ’m confused about ,
m e013 [ s^ bu^ df] : cuz I t hink [ disfm arker] I t hought t hat our syst em
was m ore like fort y percent wit hout t he Wiener filt ering .
m n052 [ s^ ar] : No ,
m n052 [ s.%−−] : it ’s like , uh ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n052 [ s.%−] : well , t hese are not [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t his wit h t he v new VAD ?
m n052 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : No , it ’s t he old VAD .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : So m y baseline was , [ vocalsound] uh , [ vocalsound]
nine [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s.%−] : This is like [ disfm arker] w t he baseline is ninet y − five
point six eight , and eight y − nine , and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s] : So I m ean , if you can do all t hese in word errors it ’s a
lot [ disfm arker] a lot easier act ually .
m n052 [ qw^ br^ rt ] : What was t hat ?
m n052 [ qw^ br] : Sorry ?
m e013 [ s^ r|qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : If y ou do all t hese in word error rat es it ’s
a lot easier , right ?
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Oh ,
m n052 [ s^ bk] : OK , OK , OK .
m e013 [ fh] : OK ,
m n052 [ s] : Errors , right , I don’t have .
m e013 [ s^ df] : cuz t hen you can figure out t he percent ages .
m n052 [ s] : It ’s all accuracies .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : The baseline is som et hing sim ilar t o

m n007 [ fh] : a w I m ean ,
m n007 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : t he t t he [ disfm arker] t he baseline t hat
y ou are t alking about is t he MFCC baseline , right ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : The t yeah ,
m n007 [ qrr.%−−] : Or [ disfm arker] ?
m n052 [ s] : t here are t wo baselines .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ s^ na] : So t he baseline [ disfm arker] One baseline is MFCC
baseline
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : t hat [ disfm arker] When I said t hirt y percent im provem ent it
’s like MFCC baseline .
m e013 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker] so [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw] : so what ’s it st art on ?
m e013 [ qw^ d] : The MFCC baseline is [ disfm arker] is what ?
m e013 [ s^ e] : Is at what level ?
m n052 [ s.%−−] : It ’s t he [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : it ’s just t he m el frequency and t hat ’s it .
m e013 [ s^ ar|qw] : No , what ’s [ disfm arker] what ’s t he num ber ?
m n052 [ h|s^ no] : Uh , so I I don’t hav e t hat num ber here .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : OK , OK , OK ,
m n052 [ s] : I have it here .
m n052 [ fh|s] : Uh , it ’s t he VAD plus t he baseline act ually .
m n052 [ s^ df] : I ’m t alking about t he [ disfm arker] t he MFCC plus I do a
fram e dropping on it .
m n052 [ s^ rt ] : So t hat ’s like [ disfm arker] t he word error rat e is like
four point t hree .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Four point t hree .
m n052 [ s] : Like [ disfm arker] Ten point seven .
m e013 [ qw] : What ’s t en point seven ?
m n052 [ s.%−−] : It ’s a m edium m ism a
m n052 [ s^ fa] : OK , sorry .
m n052 [ s] : There ’s a well m a well m at ched , m edium m ism at ched ,
and a high m at ched .
m e013 [ b] : Ah .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : So I don’t have t he [ disfm arker] like t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : OK ,
m e013 [ s] : four point t hree ,
m n052 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : t en point seven ,
m n052 [ s] : And fort y fort y .
m e013 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : Fort y percent is t he high m ism at ch .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ s] : And t hat becom es like four point t hree [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s] : Not changed .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n052 [ s^ rt ] : it ’s like t en point one .
m n052 [ s^ na] : St ill t he sam e .
m n052 [ s] : And t he high m ism at ch is like eight een point five .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Eight een point fiv e .
m n052 [ s^ 2.%] : Fiv e .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : And what were you just describing ?
m n052 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh , t he one is [ disfm arker] t his one is just t he
baseline plus t he , uh , Wiener filt er plugged int o it .
m e013 [ qw] : But where ’s t he , uh , on − line norm alizat ion and so on ?
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Oh ,
m n052 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ %−−] : So [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ fa] : Sorry .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : So , wit h t he [ disfm arker] wit h t he on − line
norm alizat ion , t he perform ance was , um , t en [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ bk|s^ rt ] : OK , so it ’s like four point t hree .
m n052 [ fh] : Uh ,
m n052 [ s] : and again , t hat ’s t he ba t he t en point , uh , four and
t went y point one .
m n052 [ s] : That was wit h on − line norm alizat ion and LDA .
m n052 [ s] : So t he h well m at ched has like lit erally not changed by
adding on − line or LDA on it .
m n052 [ %−−] : But t he [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : I m ean , even t he m edium m ism at ch is pret t y m uch t he
sam e .
m n052 [ s] : And t he high m ism at ch was im proved by t went y percent
absolut e .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : and what kind of num ber [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw] : an and what are we t alking about here ?
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t his TI − digit s
m n052 [ s] : It ’s t he It − it ’s It alian .
m e013 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : I ’m t alking about It alian ,
m e013 [ qy ^ 2^ rt ] : It alian ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : yeah .
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : And what did [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw] : So , what was t he , um , uh , corresponding num ber , say
, for , um , uh , t he Alcat el syst em for inst ance ?
m n052 [ b] : Mm m .
m n052 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ qy.%] : Do y ou know ?
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ s.%−−] : so it looks t o be , um [ disfm arker]

m n052 [ qy ^ rt ] : You have it ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yep ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : it ’s t hree point four ,
m n007 [ s] : uh , eight point , uh , sev en ,
m n007 [ s] : and , uh , t hirt een point seven .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m n052 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ s^ ft ^ t 3] : So [ disfm arker] Thanks .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ fg] : So ,
m n052 [ fh|s^ rt ] : uh , t his is t he single st age Wiener filt er ,
m n052 [ s] : wit h [ disfm arker] The noise est im at ion was based on first
t en fram es .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : Act ually I st art ed wit h [ disfm arker] using t he VAD t o
est im at e t he noise
m n052 [ s] : and t hen I found t hat it works [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : it doesn’t work for Finnish and Spanish
m n052 [ s^ df] : because t he VAD endpoint s are not good t o est im at e
t he noise
m n052 [ s^ df] : because it cut s int o t he speech som et im es ,
m n052 [ s] : so I end up overest im at ing t he noise and get t ing a worse
result .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ fh|s] : So it works only for It alian by u for [ disfm arker] using a
VAD t o est im at e noise .
m n052 [ s^ df] : It works for It alian because t he VAD was t rained on
It alian .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ fh] : So , uh [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s.%−−] : so t his was , uh [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s.%−−] : And so t his was giv ing [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ fh] : um ,
m n052 [ s] : t his [ disfm arker] t his was like not im proving a lot on t his
baseline of not hav ing t he Wiener filt er on it .
m n052 [ fh] : And ,
m n052 [ fh] : so ,
m n052 [ fh|s] : uh , I ran t his st uff wit h one m ore st age of Wiener
filt ering on it
m n052 [ s] : but t he second t im e , what I did was I [ disfm arker]
est im at ed t he new Wiener filt er based on t he cleaned up speech , and
did , uh , sm oot hing in t he frequency t o [ disfm arker] t o reduce t he
v ariance [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n052 [ s] : I m ean , I have [ disfm arker] I ’ve [ disfm arker] I ’ve observed
t here are , like , a lot of bum ps in t he frequency when I do t his Wiener
filt ering
m n052 [ s^ e] : which is m ore like a m usical noise or som et hing .
m n052 [ fh|s.%−−] : And so by adding anot her st age of Wiener filt ering ,
t he result s on t he SpeechDat − Car was like ,
m n052 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : So , I st ill don’t have t he word error rat e .
m n052 [ s^ fa] : I ’m sorry about it .
m n052 [ s] : But t he overall im provem ent was like fift y − six point four six
.
m n052 [ s^ df] : This was again using t en fram es of noise est im at e and
t wo st age of Wiener filt ering .
m n052 [ s] : And t he rest is like t he LDA plu and t he on − line
norm alizat ion all rem aining t he sam e .
m n052 [ fh] : Uh ,
m n052 [ s^ bu] : so t his was , like , com pared t o , uh , uh [ disfm arker]
Fift y − sev en is what you got by using t he French Telecom syst em ,
m n052 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n007 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : No , I don’t t hink so .
m n007 [ qy^ rt ] : Is it on It alian ?
m n052 [ %] : Y i
m n052 [ s^ ar] : No ,
m n052 [ s^ nd] : t his is over t he whole SpeechDat − Car .
m n052 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s.%−] : Oh , yeah , fift y − seven [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ 2.%−−] : point [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n052 [ s] : so t he new [ disfm arker] t he new Wiener filt ering schem a is
like [ disfm arker] som e fift y − six point four six
m n052 [ s^ e] : which is like one percent st ill less t han what you got
using t he French Telecom syst em .
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : But it ’s a pret t y sim ilar num ber in any event .
m n052 [ s^ na] : It ’s very sim ilar .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : But again , you ’re [ disfm arker] you ’re m ore or less
doing what t hey were doing ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n052 [ s^ nd.%−−] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s different in a sense like
m n052 [ s^ df] : I ’m act ually cleaning up t he cleaned up spect rum
m n052 [ s^ e] : which t hey ’re not doing .
m n052 [ s] : They ’re d what t hey ’re doing is , t hey have t wo st age
[ disfm arker] st ages of est im at ing t he Wiener filt er ,

m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] t he final filt er , what t hey do is t hey
[ disfm arker] t hey t ake it t o t heir t im e dom ain by doing an inverse
Fourier t ransform .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n052 [ s] : And t hey filt er t he original signal using t hat fil filt er ,
m n052 [ s^ e] : which is like final filt er is act ing on t he input noisy
speech rat her t han on t he cleaned up .
m n052 [ s] : So t his is m ore like I ’m doing Wiener filt er t wice ,
m n052 [ s] : but t he only t hing is t hat t he second t im e I ’m act ually
sm oot hing t he filt er and t hen cleaning up t he cleaned up spect rum
first lev el .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ s] : And so t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s what
t he difference is .
m n052 [ s] : And act ually I t ried it on s t he original clean [ disfm arker] I
m ean , t he original spect rum where , like , I [ disfm arker] t he second
t im e I est im at e t he filt er but act ually clean up t he noisy speech rat her
t he c s first [ disfm arker] out put of t he first st age
m n052 [ s] : and t hat doesn’t [ disfm arker] seem s t o be a [ disfm arker]
giv ing , I m ean , t hat m uch im prov em ent .
m n052 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I didn didn’t run it for t he whole case .
m n052 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s.%−−] : and what I t what I t ried was , by using t he sam e t hing
m n052 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker] Uh ,
m n052 [ s] : so we act ually found t hat t he VAD is very , like , crucial .
m n052 [ s^ df] : I m ean , just by changing t he VAD it self gives you t he
[ disfm arker] a lot of im provem ent
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s^ df] : by inst ead of using t he current VAD , if you just t ake up
t he VAD out put from t he channel zero , [ com m ent ] when [ disfm arker]
inst ead of using channel zero and channel one ,
m n052 [ s^ df] : because t hat was t he p t hat was t he reason why I was
not get t ing a lot of im provem ent for est im at ing [ com m ent ] t he noise .
m n052 [ s] : So I just used t he channel zero VAD t o est im at e t he noise
so t hat it gives m e som e reliable m ar m arkers for t his noise est im at ion
.
m e013 [ qw] : What ’s a channel zero VAD ?
m e013 [ s] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m confused about t hat .
m n052 [ h] : Um ,
m n052 [ s.%−] : so , it ’s like [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : So it ’s t he close − t alking m icrophone .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n052 [ s.%−−] : t he close − t alking wit hout [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , oh , oh , oh .

m n052 [ s] : So because t he channel zero and channel one are like t he
sam e speech , but only w I m ean , t he sam e endpoint s .
m e013 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n052 [ s] : But t he only t hing is t hat t he speech is very noisy for
channel one ,
m n052 [ s] : so y ou can act ually use t he out put of t he channel zero for
channel one for t he VAD .
m n052 [ s] : I m ean , t hat ’s like a cheat ing m et hod .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ fh] : I m ean ,
m e013 [ qy.%−−] : so a are t hey going t o pro
m e013 [ qw] : What are t hey doing t o do ,
m e013 [ qy^ rt ] : do we know yet ?
m e013 [ s^ e] : about [ disfm arker] as far as what t hey ’re [ disfm arker]
what t he rules are going t o be and what we can use ?
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ s] : so act ually I received a [ disfm arker] a new docum ent ,
describing t his .
m n052 [ s.%−] : Yeah , t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : And what t hey did finally is t o , m m m , uh , not t o align t he
ut t erances but t o perform recognit ion ,
m n007 [ fh|s^ e] : um , only on t he close − t alking m icrophone ,
m n007 [ s] : and t o t ake t he result of t he recognit ion t o get t he
boundaries uh , of speech .
m n052 [ s] : Which is t he channel zero .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So it ’s not like t hat ’s being done in one place or one
t im e .
m n007 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s just a rule
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : and we ’d [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker] you
were perm it t ed t o do t hat .
m e013 [ qy] : Is [ disfm arker] is t hat it ?
m n007 [ h|s] : Uh , I t hink t hey will send , um , files
m n007 [ s.%−] : but we [ disfm arker] we don’t [ disfm arker] Well ,
apparent ly [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh , so t hey will send files
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : so everybody will hav e t he sam e boundaries t o work
wit h ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : But act ually t heir alignm ent act ually is not seem s t o be
im proving in like on all cases .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ %−] : Oh , i
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,

m n007 [ fh|s.%−−] : so what happened here is t hat , um , t he overall
im provem ent t hat t hey have wit h t his m et hod [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh|s^ rt ] : So [ disfm arker] Well , t o be m ore precise , what t hey
have is , t hey have t hese alignm ent s
m n007 [ s] : and t hen t hey drop t he beginning silence and [ disfm arker]
and t he end silence
m n007 [ s] : but t hey keep , uh , t wo hundred m illiseconds before
speech and t wo hundred aft er speech .
m n007 [ s] : And t hey keep t he speech pauses also .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s.%−−] : and t he overall im provem ent over t he MFCC baseline
m n007 [ s^ bu|qy ^ d^ g] : So , when t hey just , uh , add t his fram e
dropping in addit ion it ’s r uh , fort y percent , right ?
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ bsc] : Fourt een percent , I m ean .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n052 [ %−] : which is [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %−−] : which is ,
m n007 [ fh] : um ,
m n007 [ %−−] : t
m n007 [ s^ e] : which is t he overall im provem ent .
m n007 [ s] : But in som e cases it doesn’t im prove at all .
m n007 [ qy ] : Like , uh , y do you rem em ber which case ?
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : It giv es like negat ive [ disfm arker] Well , in [ disfm arker] in
like som e It alian and TI − digit s ,
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ %] : som e @ @ .
m n052 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : So by using t he endpoint ed speech , act ually it ’s worse
t han t he baseline in som e inst ances ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n052 [ s^ e] : which could be due t o t he word pat t ern .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] Yeah , t he ot her t hing also is t hat
fourt een percent is less t han what y ou obt ain using a real VAD .
m n052 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , our neural net [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ e] : So wit h wit hout cheat ing like t his .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah , yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]

m n007 [ s] : So I t hink t his shows t hat t here is st ill work [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ ba] : Uh , well , working on t he VAD is st ill [ disfm arker] st ill
im port ant I t hink .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ %] : c
m n007 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Can I ask just a [ disfm arker] a high level quest ion ?
m e018 [ qy ^ co] : Can you just say like one or t wo sent ences about
Wiener filt ering and why [ disfm arker] why are people doing t hat ?
m n052 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ qw] : What ’s [ disfm arker] what ’s t he deal wit h t hat ?
m n052 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n052 [ fh] : so
m n052 [ s.%−−] : t he Wiener filt er , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s like [ disfm arker]
it ’s like y ou t ry t o m inim ize [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : I m ean , so t he basic principle of Wiener filt er is like you t ry
t o m inim ize t he , uh , d uh , difference bet ween t he noisy signal and
t he clean signal
m n052 [ s^ e] : if y ou have t wo channels .
m n052 [ s] : Like let ’s say you have a clean t signal and you have an
addit ional channel where you know what is t he noisy signal .
m n052 [ s] : And t hen you t ry t o m inim ize t he error bet ween t hese t wo .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : So t hat ’s t he basic principle .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : And you get [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s.%−−] : y ou can do t hat [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : I m ean , if [ disfm arker] if y ou have only a c noisy signal , at
a level which you , y ou w t ry t o est im at e t he noise from t he w assum ing
t hat t he first few fram es are noise
m n052 [ s] : or if y ou have a w voice act ivit y det ect or , uh , you est im at e
t he noise spect rum .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s.%−] : And t hen you [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Do y ou assum e t he noise is t he sam e ?
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : in [ disfm arker] yeah , aft er t he speech st art s .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m n052 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : but t hat ’s not t he case in , uh , m any [ disfm arker] m any of
our cases
m n052 [ s^ df] : but it works reasonably well .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : And [ disfm arker] and t hen you What you do is you , uh
b
m n052 [ x] : fff .

m n052 [ %−−] : So again ,
m n052 [ s^ t 3.%−−] : I can writ e down som e of t hese eq
m n052 [ s^ bk^ t 3] : Oh , OK .
m n052 [ s^ bk^ t 3] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : And t hen you do t his [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : uh , t his is t he t ransfer funct ion of t he Wiener filt er ,
m n052 [ s] : so " SF " is a clean speech spect rum , power spect rum
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : And " N " is t he noisy power spect rum .
m n052 [ s] : And so t his is t he t ransfer funct ion .
m e013 [ s^ aa^ t 1] : Right
m e013 [ s^ t 1] : act ually , I guess [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ fh] : And ,
m n052 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : And t hen you m ult iply y our noisy power spect rum wit h t his .
m n052 [ s] : You get an est im at e of t he clean power spect rum .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : but t he t hing is t hat you have t o est im at e t he SF from t he
noisy spect rum , what you have .
m n052 [ s] : So y ou est im at e t he NF from t he init ial noise port ions
m n052 [ s] : and t hen you subt ract t hat from t he current noisy
spect rum t o get an est im at e of t he SF .
m n052 [ s] : So som et im es t hat becom es zero
m n052 [ s^ df] : because you do you don’t have a t rue est im at e of t he
noise .
m n052 [ s] : So t he f filt er will have like som et im es zeros in it
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s^ df] : because som e frequency values will be zeroed out
because of t hat .
m n052 [ s] : And t hat creat es a lot of discont inuit ies across t he
spect rum because @ @ t he filt er .
m n052 [ fh] : So ,
m n052 [ fh] : uh ,
m n052 [ s] : so [ disfm arker] t hat ’s what [ disfm arker] t hat was just t he
first st age of Wiener filt ering t hat I t ried .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : So is t his , um , basically s uh , sim ilar t o just regular
spect ral subt ract ion ?
m n052 [ %−] : It [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ na] : It ’s all pret t y relat ed ,
m e013 [ s^ aa] : yeah .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s^ df] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s a di t here ’s
a whole class of t echniques where you t ry in som e sense t o m inim ize
t he noise .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : And it ’s t ypically a m ean square sense , uh [ disfm arker]
uh [ disfm arker] uh , i in [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in som e way .
m e013 [ s] : And , uh [ disfm arker] uh , spect ral subt ract ion is
[ disfm arker] is , uh [ disfm arker] uh , one approach t o it .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Do people use t he Wiener filt ering in com binat ion wit h
t he spect ral subt ract ion t ypically ,
m e018 [ qrr] : or is i are t hey sort of com pet ing t echniques ?
m n052 [ s] : Not seen .
m n052 [ s^ na] : They are very s sim ilar t echniques .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : So it ’s like I haven’t seen anybody using s Wiener filt er
wit h spect ral subt ract ion .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : O oh , OK .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see ,
m e018 [ s^ bk^ r] : I see .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , in t he long run you ’re doing t he sam e t hing
m e013 [ s] : but y but t here you m ake different approx im at ions ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] in spect ral subt ract ion , for inst ance ,
t here ’s a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] an est im at ion fact or .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : You som et im es will figure out what t he noise is
m e013 [ s] : and y ou ’ll m ult iply t hat noise spect rum t im es som e
const ant and subt ract t hat
m e013 [ s.%−−] : rat her t han [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and som et im es people [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : ev en t hough t his really should be in t he power dom ain ,
som et im es people s work in t he m agnit ude dom ain because it
[ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it works bet t er .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : And , uh , uh , you know .
m e018 [ qw] : So why did you choose , uh , Wiener filt ering over som e
ot her [ disfm arker] one of t hese ot her t echniques ?
m n052 [ h|s] : Uh , t he reason was , like , we had t his choice of using
spect ral subt ract ion , Wiener filt ering , and t here was one m ore t hing
which I which I ’m t rying , is t his sub space approach .
m n052 [ fh] : So ,
m n052 [ s] : St ephane is working on spect ral subt ract ion .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n052 [ s.%−] : So I picked up [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ s^ bu] : So you ’re sort of t rying @ @ t hem all .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Y Yeah ,
m n052 [ s^ df] : we just want ed t o have a few noise product ion
[ disfm arker] com pensat ion t echniques
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Ah ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n052 [ s^ df] : and t hen pick som e from t hat [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e013 [ fg] : I m I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s^ df] : pick one .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : y eah , I m ean , t here ’s Car − Carm en ’s working on
anot her , on t he v ect or Taylor series .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : VA Yeah , VAD .
m n052 [ b] : w Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So t hey were just kind of t ry ing t o cover a bunch of
different t hings wit h t his t ask and see , y ou know , what are
[ disfm arker] what are t he issues for each of t hem .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Ah ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : That m akes sense .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Cool ,
m e018 [ s^ ft ] : t hanks .
m n052 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : so one of [ disfm arker] one of t he t hings t hat I t ried , like I
said , was t o rem ove t hose zeros in t he fri filt er by doing som e
sm oot hing of t he filt er .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : Like , you est im at e t he edge of square
m n052 [ s] : and t hen you do a f sm oot hing across t he frequency so
t hat t hose zeros get , like , flat t ened out .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : And t hat doesn’t seem s t o be im proving by t rying it on t he
first t im e .
m n052 [ s] : So what I did was like I p did t his
m n052 [ s] : and t hen you [ disfm arker] I plugged in t he [ disfm arker]
one m ore [ disfm arker] t he sam e t hing but wit h t he sm oot hed filt er t he
second t im e .
m n052 [ s] : And t hat seem s t o be working .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : So t hat ’s where I got like fift y − six point five percent
im provem ent on SpeechDat − Car wit h t hat .
m n052 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : So t he ot her t hing what I t ried was I used st ill t he t en
fram es of noise est im at e
m n052 [ s] : but I used t his channel zero VAD t o drop t he fram es .
m n052 [ s] : So I ’m not [ disfm arker] st ill not est im at ing .
m n052 [ s] : And t hat has t aken t he perform ance t o like sixt y − seven
percent in SpeechDat − Car ,
m n052 [ s^ e] : which is [ disfm arker] which [ disfm arker] which like sort
of shows t hat by using a proper VAD y ou can just t ake it t o furt her ,
bet t er lev els .
m n052 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So t hat ’s sort of like , you know , best − case
perform ance ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n052 [ s.%−−] : so far I ’ve seen sixt y − seven [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ ar] : I m ean , no ,
m n052 [ s] : I haven’t seen s like sixt y − sev en percent .
m n052 [ fh] : And , uh ,
m n052 [ s] : using t he channel zero VAD t o est im at e t he noise also
seem s t o be im prov ing
m n052 [ s] : but I don’t have t he result s for all t he cases wit h t hat .
m n052 [ s] : So I used channel zero VAD t o est im at e noise as a lesser 2
x fram e ,
m n052 [ s^ e] : which is like , [ vocalsound] everywhere I use t he
channel zero VAD .
m n052 [ s] : And t hat seem s t o be t he best com binat ion , uh , rat her
t han using a few fram es t o est im at e and t hen drop a channel .
m e013 [ s] : So I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m st ill a lit t le confused .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu] : Is t hat channel zero inform at ion going t o be
accessible during t his t est .
m n052 [ h] : Nnn ,
m n052 [ s^ ar] : no .
m n052 [ s^ df^ nd] : This is just t o t est whet her we can really im prove by
using a bet t er VAD .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ fh] : So ,
m n052 [ s] : I m ean [ disfm arker] So t his is like t he noise com pensat ion
f is fix ed
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : but y ou m ake a bet t er decision on t he endpoint s .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : That ’s , like [ disfm arker] seem s t o be [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : so we c
m n052 [ s] : so I m ean , which [ disfm arker] which m eans , like , by using
t his t echnique what we im prov e just t he VAD
m e013 [ b] : Yes .
m n052 [ s] : we can just t ake t he perform ance by anot her t en percent
or bet t er .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ s] : So , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat was just t he , uh , reason for
doing t hat experim ent .
m n052 [ fh] : And , w um [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ fg|s] : Yeah , but t his [ disfm arker] all t hese t hings , I have t o
st ill t ry it on t he TI − digit s ,
m n052 [ s^ e] : which is like I ’m just running .
m n052 [ s] : And t here seem s t o be not im proving a [ disfm arker] a lot
on t he TI − digit s ,
m n052 [ s] : so I ’m like invest igat ing t hat , why it ’s not .
m n052 [ fh] : And ,
m n052 [ fh] : um ,
m n052 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ t 1] : Well aft er t hat .
m n052 [ fh] : So ,
m n052 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : so t he ot her [ disfm arker] t he ot her t hing is [ disfm arker]
like I ’v e been [ disfm arker] I ’m doing all t his st uff on t he power
spect rum .
m n052 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : Tried t his st uff on t he m el as well [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ e] : m el and t he m agnit ude , and m el m agnit ude , and all
t hose t hings .
m n052 [ s] : But it seem s t o be t he power spect rum seem s t o be
get t ing t he best result .
m n052 [ s] : So , one of [ disfm arker] one of reasons I t hought like
doing t he av eraging , aft er t he filt ering using t he m el filt er bank , t hat
seem s t o be m ay be helping rat her t han t ry ing it on t he m el filt er ba
filt ered out put s .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ %] : Ma
m n052 [ s.%−] : So just t h
m e013 [ s] : Makes sense .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n052 [ s] : t h t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he only t hing t hat I could
t hink of why [ disfm arker] why it ’s giving im provem ent on t he m el .
m n052 [ fh] : And , y ep .
m n052 [ s] : So t hat ’s it .

m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : Uh , how about t he subspace st uff ?
m n052 [ s^ ng] : Subspace , [ com m ent ] I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m like
[ disfm arker] t hat ’s st ill in [ disfm arker] a lit t le bit in t he back burner
m n052 [ s^ df] : because I ’ve been p put t ing a lot effort on t his t o
m ake it work , on t uning t hings and ot her st uff .
m e013 [ b.%] : OK .
m n052 [ fh] : So
m n052 [ s] : I was like going parallely
m n052 [ s] : but not m uch of im provem ent .
m n052 [ s] : I ’m just [ disfm arker] have som e skelet ons ready ,
m n052 [ s] : need som e m ore t im e for it .
m e013 [ b.%] : OK .
m n052 [ fh] : Mm m .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : Tha − t hat it ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m n052 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yep .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Cool .
m e018 [ qy^ co^ rt ^ t c] : Do you wanna go , St ephane ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Uh , yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So , [ vocalsound] I ’v e been , uh , working st ill on t he
spect ral subt ract ion .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s] : So t o r t o rem ind you [ v ocalsound] [ vocalsound] a lit t le bit
of [ disfm arker] of what I did before , is just [ vocalsound] t o apply som e
spect ral subt ract ion wit h an ov erest im at ion fact or
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : also t o get , um , an est im at e of t he noise , uh ,
spect rum ,
m n007 [ s] : and subt ract t his est im at ion of t he noise spect rum from
t he , uh , signal spect rum , [ com m ent ] but subt ract ing m ore when t he
SNR is [ disfm arker] is , uh , low ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : which is a t echnique t hat it ’s oft en used .
m e018 [ qw^ d.%−−] : " Subt ract ing m ore " , m eaning [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ s] : So y ou overest im at e t he noise spect rum .
m n007 [ s] : You m ult iply t he noise spect rum by a fact or , uh , which
depends on t he SNR .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n007 [ s] : So , abov e t went y DB ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n007 [ s] : it ’s one , so you just subt ract t he noise .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : And t hen it ’s b
m n007 [ s] : Generally [ disfm arker] Well , I use , act ually , a linear , uh ,
funct ion of t he SNR ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ e] : which is bounded t o , like , t wo or t hree , [ com m ent ]
when t he SNR is below zero DB .

m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh|s] : Um , doing just t his , uh , eit her on t he FFT bins or on
t he m el bands , um , t doesn’t yield any im provem ent
m e013 [ b.%] : Oh !
m e013 [ fg|qw] : Um , uh , what are you doing wit h negat ive , uh ,
powers ?
m n007 [ %] : o
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So t here is also a t hreshold , of course ,
m n007 [ s] : because aft er subt ract ion you can have negat ive energies
,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : So what I [ disfm arker] I just do is t o put , uh [ disfm arker]
t o [ disfm arker] t o add [ disfm arker] t o put t he t hreshold first and t hen
t o add a sm all am ount of noise ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : which right now is speech − shaped .
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw^ d^ m ^ rt ] : Speech − shaped ?
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ s] : so it ’s [ disfm arker] a it has t he overall [ disfm arker] overall
energy ,
m n007 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %−−] : pow
m n007 [ s] : it has t he overall power spect rum of speech .
m n007 [ s] : So wit h a bum p around one kilohert z .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : So when y when you t alk about t here being som et hing
less t han zero aft er subt ract ing t he noise , is t hat at a part icular
frequency bin ?
m n007 [ %] : i
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ na] : There can be frequency bins wit h negat ive values .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : And so when y ou say you ’re adding som et hing t hat
has t he ov erall shape of speech , is t hat in a [ disfm arker] in a
part icular frequency bin ?
m e018 [ qrr^ d] : Or y ou ’re adding som et hing across all t he
frequencies when you get t hese negat ives ?
m n007 [ s^ na] : For each frequencies I a I ’m adding som e , uh , noise ,
m n007 [ s^ df] : but t he a t he am ount of [ disfm arker] t he am ount of
noise I add is not t he sam e for all t he frequency bins .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Ah !
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I got cha .

m e018 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n007 [ s] : Uh . Right now I don’t t hink if it m akes sense t o add
som et hing t hat ’s speech − shaped ,
m n007 [ s^ df] : because t hen you hav e silence port ion t hat have som e
spect ra sim ilar t o t he sp t he overall speech spect ra .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ %−−] : But [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So t his is som et hing I can st ill work on ,
m e018 [ fg|qw] : So what does t hat m ean ?
m n007 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ s] : I ’m t rying t o underst and what it m eans when you do t he
spect ral subt ract ion and you get a negat ive .
m e018 [ s^ bu.%−] : It m eans t hat at t hat part icular frequency range
y ou subt ract ed m ore energy t han t here was act ually [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s.%−] : That m eans t hat [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fg|s] : So [ disfm arker] so yeah , you hav e an [ disfm arker] an
est im at ion of t he noise spect rum ,
m n007 [ s] : but som et im es , of course , it ’s [ disfm arker] as t he noise
is not perfect ly st at ionary ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : som et im es t his est im at ion can be , uh , t oo sm all ,
m n007 [ s] : so you don’t subt ract enough .
m n007 [ s] : But som et im es it can be t oo large also . If [ disfm arker] if
t he noise , uh , energy in t his part icular frequency band drops for
som e reason .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : So in [ disfm arker] in an ideal word i world [ com m ent ] if
t he noise were alway s t he sam e , t hen , when you subt ract ed it t he
worst t hat i y ou would get would be a zero .
m e018 [ s] : I m ean , t he lowest y ou would get would be a zero ,
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s^ bu^ df] : cuz i if t here was no ot her energy t here you ’re just
subt ract ing ex act ly t he noise .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m ,
m n007 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : Yep , t here ’s all [ disfm arker] t here ’s all sort s of , uh
, dev iat ions from t he ideal here .
m e013 [ s^ df] : I m ean , for inst ance , y ou ’re [ disfm arker] you ’re
t alking about t he signal and noise , um , at a part icular point .

m e013 [ s] : And even if som et hing is sort of st at ionary in st er t erm s of
st at ist ics , t here ’s no guarant ee t hat any part icular inst ant iat ion or
piece of it is ex act ly a part icular num ber or bounded by a part icular
range .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So , you ’re figuring out from som e chunk of [ disfm arker] of
[ disfm arker] of t he signal what y ou t hink t he noise is .
m e013 [ s] : Then you ’re subt ract ing t hat from anot her chunk ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : and t here ’s absolut ely no reason t o t hink t hat you ’d know
t hat it wouldn’t , uh , be negat iv e in som e places .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , on t he ot her hand t hat just m eans t hat in som e
sense y ou ’v e m ade a m ist ake
m e013 [ s^ df] : because you cert ainly have st ra subt ract ed a bigger
num ber t han is due t o t he noise .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um [ disfm arker] Also , we speak [ disfm arker] t he whole
[ disfm arker] where all t his st uff com es from is from an assum pt ion t hat
signal and noise are uncorrelat ed .
m e013 [ s] : And t hat cert ainly m akes sense in s in [ disfm arker] in a
st at ist ical int erpret at ion , t hat , you know , over , um , all possible
realizat ions t hat t hey ’re uncorrelat ed
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : or assum ing , uh , ergodicit y t hat i t hat i um , across t im e ,
uh , it ’s uncorrelat ed .
m e013 [ s] : But if you just look at [ disfm arker] a quart er second , uh ,
and you cross − m ult iply t he t wo t hings , uh , you could very well , uh ,
end up wit h som et hing t hat sum s t o som et hing t hat ’s not zero .
m e013 [ s] : So in fact , t he t wo signals could have som e relat ion t o
one anot her .
m e013 [ s] : And so t here ’s all sort s of dev iat ions from ideal in t his .
m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and given all t hat , you could definit ely
end up wit h som et hing t hat ’s negat ive .
m e013 [ s] : But if down t he road you ’re m aking use of som et hing as if
it is a power spect rum , um , t hen it can be bad t o have som et hing
negat ive .
m e013 [ qw] : Now , t he ot her t hing I wonder about act ually is , what if
y ou left it negat iv e ?
m e013 [ qw] : What happens ?
m e013 [ s^ df.%−] : I m ean , because [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ qy ] : Is t hat t he log ?
m e013 [ fh|qy ^ rt ] : Um , are you t aking t he log before you add t hem up
t o t he m el ?
m n052 [ s^ nd] : Aft er t hat .

m n052 [ s^ ar] : No ,
m n052 [ s^ nd] : aft er .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : So t he t hing is , I wonder how [ disfm arker] if you put your
t hresholds aft er t hat , I wonder how oft en you would end up wit h , uh
[ disfm arker] wit h negat ive values .
m n052 [ s.%−] : But y ou will [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ bu|qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : But y ou end up reducing som e neighboring
frequency bins [ disfm arker] @ @ in t he average , right ?
m n052 [ s^ e] : When you add t he negat iv e t o t he posit ive value
m n052 [ s^ e] : which is t he t rue est im at e .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ng|qy ^ d^ g] : But nonet heless , uh , you know , t hese are
[ disfm arker] it ’s anot her f kind of sm oot hing , right ?
m e013 [ s^ e] : t hat y ou ’re doing .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : So , you ’ve done your best shot at figuring out what t he
noise should be ,
m e013 [ s] : and now i t hen you ’ve subt ract ed it off .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen aft er t hat , inst ead of [ disfm arker] inst ead of , uh
, uh , leaving it as is and adding t hings [ disfm arker] adding up som e
neighbors , y ou art ificially push it up .
m n052 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s] : Which is , you know , it ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s no part icular
reason t hat t hat ’s t he right t hing t o do eit her ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So , um ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ s:s] : i in fact , what you ’d be doing is saying , " well , we ’re d
we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re going t o definit ely dim inish t he effect of t his

m e013 [ s^ bd] : It ’s just a t hought .
m e013 [ s^ no.%−] : I d I don’t know if it would be [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : Sort of t he opposit e of t hat would be if [ disfm arker] if you
find out y ou ’re going t o get a negat ive num ber , you don’t do t he
subt ract ion for t hat bin .
m n052 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : That is t rue .
m e013 [ h|s^ aa] : Nnn , yeah ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : That would be alm ost t he opposit e ,
m e013 [ %−] : alt hough [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e018 [ s^ bu] : Inst ead of leaving it negat ive , you don’t do it .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : If y our [ disfm arker] if your subt ract ion ’s going t o
result in a negat iv e num ber , you [ disfm arker] you don’t do subt ract ion
in t hat .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : but t hat m eans t hat in a sit uat ion where you t hought t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat t he bin was alm ost ent irely noise , you left it .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n052 [ %−] : We just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m e018 [ s^ df] : Yeah , I ’m just saying t hat ’s like t he opposit e .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ na] : Well , yeah t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he opposit e ,
m e018 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : yeah .
m n007 [ fg] : And , yeah ,
m n007 [ s] : som e people also [ disfm arker] if it ’s a negat ive value t hey
, uh , re − com put e it using int er int erpolat ion from t he edges and bins
.
m n052 [ s] : For fram es , frequency bins .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ e] : Well , t here are different t hings t hat you can do .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s] : People can also , uh , reflect it back up and essent ially do
a full wav e rect ificat ion inst ead of a [ disfm arker] inst ead of half wav e .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s^ df] : But it was just a t hought t hat [ disfm arker] t hat it m ight
be som et hing t o t ry .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m n007 [ s] : Well , act ually I t ried , [ vocalsound] som et hing else based
on t his , um , is t o [ disfm arker] t o put som e sm oot hing ,
m n007 [ fh|s^ df] : um , because it seem s t o [ disfm arker] t o help or it
seem s t o help t he Wiener filt ering
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : and ,
m n007 [ fh] : m m m [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : So what I did is , uh , som e kind of nonlinear sm oot hing .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Act ually I have a recursion t hat com put es [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk|s^ co] : Yeah , let m e go back a lit t le bit .
m n007 [ s] : Act ually , when you do spect ral subt ract ion you can , uh ,
find t his [ disfm arker] t his equivalent in t he s in t he spect ral dom ain .

m n007 [ s.%−−] : You can uh com put e ,
m n007 [ s] : y y ou can say t hat d y our spect ral subt ract ion is a filt er ,
m n007 [ fh|s] : um , and t he gain of t his filt er is t he , um , [ vocalsound]
signal energy m inus what you subt ract , divided by t he signal energy .
m n007 [ s] : And t his is a gain t hat varies over t im e , and , you know , of
course , uh , depending on t he s on t he noise spect rum and on t he
speech spect rum .
m n007 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : what happen act ually is t hat during low SNR values , t he
gain is close t o zero
m n007 [ s^ e] : but it varies a lot .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m ,
m n007 [ s] : and t his [ disfm arker] t his is t he cause of m usical noise
and all t hese [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] t he fact you
[ disfm arker] we go below zero one fram e and t hen you can have an
energy t hat ’s abov e zero .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ %−−] : And [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : So t he sm oot hing is [ disfm arker] I did a sm oot hing
act ually on t his gain , uh , t raject ory .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : But it ’s [ disfm arker] t he sm oot hing is nonlinear in t he
sense t hat I t ried t o not sm oot h if t he gain is high ,
m n007 [ s^ df] : because in t his case we know t hat , uh , t he est im at e
of t he gain is correct
m n007 [ s^ df^ rt ] : because we [ disfm arker] we are not close t o
[ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker] t o zero ,
m n007 [ fh|s] : um , and t o do m ore sm oot hing if t he gain is low .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : So ,
m n007 [ fh] : well ,
m n007 [ s] : basically t hat ’s t his idea ,
m n007 [ s] : and it seem s t o giv e pret t y good result s ,
m n007 [ fh|s^ df^ rt ] : uh , alt hough I ’v e just [ disfm arker] just t est ed on
It alian and Finnish .
m n007 [ s] : And on It alian it seem s [ disfm arker] m y result seem s t o be
a lit t le bit bet t er t han t he Wiener filt ering ,
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ qy^ d^ g] : right ?
m n052 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , t he one you showed yest erday .
m n052 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh|s^ no] : Uh , I don’t know if you have t hese im provem ent t he

m n052 [ x ] : Fff .
m n007 [ s] : or you have [ disfm arker] just have your own .
m n052 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : No , I don’t have , for each ,
m n052 [ s^ df] : I [ disfm arker] I just [ disfm arker] just have t he final

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : So t hese num bers he was giving before

were It alian , right ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah , yeah .

m n007 [ %] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ fg|s^ ar] : So [ disfm arker] so , no ,
m n052 [ s^ df] : I act ually didn’t giv e you t he num ber which is t he final

m n007 [ s^ 2] : On It alian .
m n007 [ s] : But on Finnish it ’s a lit t le bit worse , apparent ly .
m n052 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy^ rt ] : But do you have num bers in t erm s of word error rat es

m n007 [ s^ df] : This is in t he m el frequency bands .
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : So ,
m n007 [ s] : it could be seen as a f a [ disfm arker] a sm oot hing in t he

m n007 [ fh] : Mm m .

m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : That ’s t he m usical noise ?
m n007 [ s^ e] : Which is m usical noise ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : yeah ,
m n007 [ s.%−−] : if [ disfm arker] if it [ disfm arker] If you list en t o it
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : uh , if y ou do t his in t he FFT bins , t hen you have spot s of

m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s^ bu] : Well , none of t hese syst em s , by t he way , have

m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So one would hope , presum ably , t hat t he neural net

m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ s^ ng] : alt hough if [ disfm arker] if we , um , look at t he result

m n007 [ fh] : And
m n007 [ s] : if we have no , uh , spect ral subt ract ion or Wiener filt ering
, um , i t he syst em is [ disfm arker] Uh , we t hought t he neural

m n007 [ s^ e] : even in t hese cases of high m ism at ch .
m n007 [ s] : So , m aybe t he neural net will help less

m e013 [ s^ am ] : May be .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Could you t rain a neural net t o do spect ral subt ract ion

m e013 [ s^ df] : I m ean , you have t o figure out what your t arget s are .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,

m e018 [ s.%−] : I was t hinking if you had a clean version of t he signal

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] but it ’s [ disfm arker]
but at any rat e , y eah , people ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy^ 2^ d^ rt ] : People do t hat ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : y yeah ,
m e013 [ s^ na] : in fact , we had visit ors here who did t hat
m e013 [ s] : I t hink when you were here ba way back when .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e013 [ s] : people [ disfm arker] d done lot s of experim ent at ion over
t he y ears wit h t raining neural net s .
m e013 [ s] : And it ’s not a bad t hing t o do .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s anot her approach .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ %−−] : M I m ean , it ’s [ disfm arker] it , um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : The object ion everyone always raises , which has som e
t rut h t o it is t hat , um , it ’s good for m apping from a part icular noise t o
clean
m e013 [ s] : but t hen you get a different noise .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And t he experim ent s we saw t hat visit ors did here showed
t hat it [ disfm arker] t here was at least som e , um , [ vocalsound]
[ com m ent ] gent leness t o t he degradat ion when you swit ched t o

m e013 [ s] : It did seem t o help .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : So t hat [ disfm arker] y ou ’re right ,
m e013 [ s^ na] : t hat ’s anot her [ disfm arker] anot her way t o go .
m e018 [ qw] : How did it com pare on [ disfm arker] I m ean , for
[ disfm arker] for good cases where it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] uh ,
st uff t hat it was t rained on ?
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Did it do pret t y well ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Oh , yeah ,
m e013 [ s^ na] : it did very well .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .

m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s] : but t o som e ext ent t hat ’s kind of what we ’re doing .
m e013 [ s^ df] : I m ean , we ’re not doing exact ly t hat ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : we ’re not t rying t o generat e good exam ples

m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ 2] : You could say it ’s sort of built in .
m e013 [ %−−] : It ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s^ na] : it ’s kind of built int o t hat .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and t hat ’s why we have found t hat it
[ disfm arker] it does help .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : so ,
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ cs] : yeah , I m ean , we ’ll just have t o t ry it .
m e013 [ s^ df] : But I [ disfm arker] I would [ disfm arker] I would
[ disfm arker] I would im agine t hat it will help som e .

m e013 [ s] : but I would im agine it would help som e .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So in any event , all of t his [ disfm arker] I was just

m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ s^ aa^ r] : y eah .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ?
m n007 [ fg] : Um ,
m n007 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : Yeah , so t his is t h t he , um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Well , act ually , t his was kind of t he first t ry wit h t his

m n007 [ fh] : so [ vocalsound] uh ,
m e013 [ s^ ba] : It ’s am azing how oft en t hat happens .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s] : so t his is t he first t hing .
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , anot her t hing t hat I [ disfm arker] it ’s

m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s^ df] : Because when I do t he sm oot hing , uh , it ’s a

m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m n052 [ qrr] : Or [ disfm arker] or no ?
m n007 [ s] : It ’s t he recursion ,

m n007 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]

t hat I didn’t , uh , @ @ a lot yet ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh !
m n007 [ %−] : which [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ ft ] : Sorry .
m e018 [ s] : A quick quest ion just about t he lat ency t hing .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : If [ disfm arker] if t here ’s anot her part of t he syst em
t hat causes a lat ency of a hundred m illiseconds , is t his an addit ive

m e018 [ qrr] : Or c or is yours hidden in t hat ?
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ ar] : No ,
m e018 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ nd] : it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s added .

m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ %−−] : We can [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ s] : We can do som et hing in parallel also , in som e like

m e018 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m n052 [ s] : And we can do t hat in parallel wit h som e ot her filt ering you

m n007 [ b] : Mm m .

m n052 [ s] : But by t hen you already hav e t he sufficient sam ples t o do
t he filt ering .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : So , som et im es you can do it anyway .
m e018 [ qy .%−−] : I m ean , couldn’t ,
m e018 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ %−−] : I [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ] : Couldn’t you just also [ disfm arker] I m ean , i if you know
t hat t he l t he largest lat ency in t he syst em is t wo hundred m illiseconds
, don’t y ou [ disfm arker] couldn’t y ou just buffer up t hat num ber of

m e018 [ s^ e^ rt ] : and t hen everyt hing uses t hat buffer ?
m n052 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ e^ rt ] : And t hat way it ’s not addit ive ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Well , in fact , ev ery t hing is sent over in buffers cuz of
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy.%−−] : isn’t it t he TCP buffer som e [ disfm arker] ?
m n052 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : You m ean , t he [ disfm arker] t he dat a , t he

m e013 [ s^ aa^ r] : y eah .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ bk|s^ ng] : Yeah , but t hat has a variable lat ency
m n052 [ s^ df] : because t he last fram e doesn’t have any lat ency

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ %−−] : Because [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : I m ean t he t ransm ission over [ disfm arker] over t he air

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ qw.%−−] : But , so what ’s t his result you t old m e about , t he
fact t hat if y ou use m ore t han t en fram es y ou can [ disfm arker] im prove
by t
m n052 [ s] : Well , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s using t he channel zero .
m n052 [ s^ rt ] : If I use a channel zero VAD t o est im at e t he noise .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n052 [ %−] : Which [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bu.%−−] : But t his is t en fram es plus [ disfm arker] plus
m n052 [ s] : Channel zero dropping .
m n007 [ s^ bk.%−−] : channel [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ ar] : Uh , no ,
m n007 [ s] : t hese result s wit h t wo st age Wiener filt ering is t en fram es
m n052 [ b] : Hm m .
m n052 [ %−] : t Oh , t his [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ e] : but possibly m ore .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , if channel one VAD gives you [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ %] : f
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ fg] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ s] : but in t his experim ent I did [ disfm arker] I didn’t use any
VAD .
m n007 [ s] : I just used t he t went y first fram e t o est im at e t he noise .
m n007 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] So I expect ed it t o be a lit t le bit bet t er ,
[ v ocalsound] if , uh , I use m ore [ disfm arker] m ore fram es .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , t hat ’s it for spect ral subt ract ion .
m n007 [ s^ t c] : The second t hing I was working on is t o , um , t ry t o
look at noise est im at ion , [ com m ent ] m m m , and using som e t echnique
t hat doesn’t need v oice act ivit y det ect ion .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s] : and for t his I u sim ply used som e code t hat , uh ,
[ v ocalsound] I had from [ disfm arker] from Belgium ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : which is t echnique t hat , um , t akes a bunch of fram e ,
m n007 [ fh] : um ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : and for each frequency bands of t his fram e , t akes a
look at t he m inim a of t he energy .

m n007 [ s^ rt ] : And t hen average t hese m inim a and t ake t his as an
[ disfm arker] an energy est im at e of t he noise for t his part icular
frequency band .
m n007 [ s] : And t here is som et hing m ore t o t his act ually .
m n007 [ s] : What is done is t hat , [ v ocalsound] uh , t hese m inim a are
com put ed , um , based on , um , high resolut ion spect ra .
m n007 [ s] : So , I com put e an FFT based on t he long , uh , signal fram e
m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : which is sixt y − four m illisecond [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : So you have one m inim um for each frequency ?
m n007 [ s] : What [ disfm arker] what I [ disfm arker] what I d uh , I do
act ually , is t o t ake a bunch of [ disfm arker] t o t ake a t ile on t he
spect rogram
m n007 [ s] : and t his t ile is five hundred m illiseconds long and t wo
hundred hert z wide .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm m .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : And t his t ile [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Uh , in t his t ile appears , like , t he harm onics if you have a
v oiced sound ,
m n007 [ s^ df] : because it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s t he FTT bins .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : And when you t ake t he m t he m inim a of [ disfm arker] of
t hese [ disfm arker] t his t ile ,
m n007 [ s] : when y ou don’t have speech , t hese m inim a will give you
som e noise lev el est im at e ,
m n007 [ s] : If y ou have voiced speech , t hese m inim a will st ill give you
som e noise est im at e because t he m inim a are bet ween t he harm onics .
m n007 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] If you have ot her [ disfm arker] ot her kind
of speech sounds t hen it ’s not t he case ,
m n007 [ s] : but if t he t im e fram e is long enough , uh , like s five
hundred m illiseconds seem s t o be long enough , [ com m ent ] you st ill
have port ions which , uh , are very close [ disfm arker] whi which m inim a
are v ery close t o t he noise energy .
m e013 [ s] : I ’m confused .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m ?
m e013 [ s] : You said five hundred m illiseconds
m e013 [ s] : but y ou said sixt y − four m illiseconds .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : Which is which ?
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : What ?
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Six t y − four m illiseconds is t o com put e t he FFT , uh , bins
.
m n007 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he FFT .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ b] : y eah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,

m n007 [ s] : act ually it ’s bet t er t o use sixt y − four m illiseconds because
, um , if you use t hirt y m illiseconds , t hen , uh , because of t he
[ disfm arker] t his short windowing and at low pit ch , uh , sounds ,
[ v ocalsound] t he harm onics are not , wha uh , correct ly separat ed .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : So if y ou t ake t hese m inim a , it [ disfm arker] b [ vocalsound]
t hey will ov erest im at e t he noise a lot .
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So you t ake sixt y − four m illisecond F F Ts and
t hen you average t hem [ com m ent ] ov er five hundred ?
m e013 [ qrr.%−−] : Or [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ fh|qw] : Uh , what do y ou do over five hundred ?
m n007 [ s] : So I t ake [ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker] I t ake a bunch of
t hese six t y − four m illisecond fram e t o cover five hundred m illiseconds ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Ah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ fh|s] : and t hen I look for t he m inim a ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ s^ e|qy ^ d^ g] : on t he [ disfm arker] on [ disfm arker] on t he
bunch of uh fift y fram es , right ?
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m .
m n007 [ s] : So t he int erest of t his is t hat , as y wit h t his t echnique you
can est im at e u som e reasonable noise spect ra wit h only five hundred
m illiseconds of [ disfm arker] of signal ,
m n007 [ s] : so if t he [ disfm arker] t he n t he noise varies a lot , uh , you
can t rack [ disfm arker] bet t er t rack t he noise ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ e] : which is not t he case if you rely on t he voice act ivit y
det ect or .
m n007 [ s] : So even if t here are no no speech pauses , you can t rack
t he noise level .
m n007 [ s] : The only requirem ent is t hat you m ust have , in t hese five
hundred m illiseconds segm ent , [ com m ent ] you m ust have voiced
sound at least .
m n007 [ s^ df] : Cuz t his [ disfm arker] t hese will help you t o [ disfm arker]
t o t rack t he [ disfm arker] t he noise level .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s] : So what I did is just t o sim ply replace t he VAD − based , uh
, noise est im at e by t his est im at e ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : first on SpeechDat − Car [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ e] : Well , only on SpeechDat − Car act ually .
m n007 [ s] : And it ’s , uh , slight ly worse ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : like one percent relat ive com pared t o t he VAD − based
[ pause] est im at es .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,

m n007 [ s^ df] : I t hink t he reason why it ’s not bet t er , is t hat t he
SpeechDat − Car noises are all st at ionary .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ fh] : So , u
m n007 [ s] : y y t here really is no need t o have som et hing t hat ’s

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] Uh ,
m n007 [ s] : well , t hey are m ainly st at ionary .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s] : But , I ex pect s m aybe som e im prov em ent on TI − digit s
m n007 [ s^ df] : because , nnn , in t his case t he noises are all
som et im es very v ariable .
m n007 [ fh|s] : Uh , so I have t o t est it .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m .
m e013 [ qy .%−−] : But are you com paring wit h som et hing [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : e I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m [ disfm arker] p s a lit t le confused
again ,
m e013 [ %−−] : i it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : Uh , when you com pare it wit h t he V A D − based ,
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ %−] : It ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy .%−] : VAD − Is t his [ disfm arker] is t his t he [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : It ’s t he France − Telecom − based spect ra , s uh ,
Wiener filt ering and VAD .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : So it ’s t heir syst em
m n007 [ s] : but just I replace t heir noise est im at e by t his one .
m e013 [ s^ bk|qy ^ d] : Oh , you ’re not doing t his wit h our syst em ?
m n007 [ s^ na] : In i I ’m not [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa] : No , no .
m n007 [ s^ ar] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ s^ nd] : it ’s our syst em
m n007 [ s^ df] : but wit h just t he Wiener filt ering from t heir syst em .
m n007 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ bu] : Act ually , t h t he best syst em t hat we st ill have is , uh ,
our sy st em but wit h t heir noise com pensat ion schem e ,
m n007 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n007 [ s] : So I ’m t rying t o im prov e on t his , and [ disfm arker] by
[ disfm arker] by replacing t heir noise est im at e by , uh , som et hing t hat
m ight be bet t er .
m e013 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m e013 [ s] : But t he spect ral subt ract ion schem e t hat you report ed on
also re requires a [ disfm arker] a noise est im at e .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−] : But I di
m e013 [ qy^ rt ] : Couldn’t you t ry t his for t hat ?
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Do you t hink it m ight help ?
m n007 [ s^ nd] : Not yet ,
m n007 [ s^ df] : because I did t his in parallel ,
m n007 [ s^ df] : and I was working on one and t he ot her .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see ,
m e013 [ s^ bk^ r] : I see .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s^ aa|s^ cc] : Yeah , for [ disfm arker] for sure I will .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : I can t ry also , m m m , t he spect ral subt ract ion .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m n052 [ s] : So I ’m also using t hat n new noise est im at e t echnique on
t his Wiener filt ering what I ’m t rying .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : So I [ disfm arker] I have , like , som e experim ent s running , I
don’t hav e t he result s .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ fh] : So .
m n052 [ s] : I don’t est im at e t he f noise on t he t en fram es but use his
est im at e .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : I , um , also im plem ent ed a sp um [ disfm arker] spect ral
whit ening idea
m n007 [ s^ e] : which is in t he , um , Ericsson proposal .
m n007 [ s] : Uh , t he idea is just t o [ vocalsound] um , flat t en t he log ,
uh , spect rum , um , and t o flat t en it m ore if t he [ disfm arker] t he
probabilit y of silence is higher .
m n007 [ s] : So in t his way , you can also reduce [ disfm arker]
som ewhat reduce t he m usical noise
m n007 [ s] : and y ou reduce t he v ariabilit y if you have different noise
shapes ,
m n007 [ s^ df] : because t he [ disfm arker] t he spect rum becom es m ore
flat in t he silence port ions .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .

m n007 [ s] : Wit h t his , no im prov em ent ,
m n007 [ s^ df] : uh , but t here are a lot of param et ers t hat we can play
wit h
m n007 [ fh] : and ,
m n007 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Act ually , t his [ disfm arker] t his could be seen as a soft
v ersion of t he fram e dropping
m n007 [ s^ df^ rt ] : because , um , y ou could just put t he t hreshold and
say t hat " below t he t hreshold , I will flat t en [ disfm arker] com p
com plet ely flat t en t he [ disfm arker] t he spect rum " .
m n007 [ s] : And abov e t his t hreshold , uh , keep t he sam e spect rum .
m n007 [ s] : So it would be like fram e dropping ,
m n007 [ s^ df] : because during t he silence port ions which are below
t he t hreshold of v oice act ivit y probabilit y , [ com m ent ] uh , w you would
have som e kind of dum m y fram e
m n007 [ s^ e] : which is a perfect ly flat spect rum .
m n007 [ s] : And t his , uh , whit ening is som et hing t hat ’s m ore soft
because , um , you whit en [ disfm arker] you just , uh , have a funct ion
[ disfm arker] t he whit ening is a funct ion of t he speech probabilit y ,
m n007 [ s] : so it ’s not a hard decision .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s] : so I t hink m aybe it can be used t oget her wit h fram e
dropping and when we are not sure about if it ’s speech or silence ,
m n007 [ s^ am ] : well , m aybe it has som et hing do wit h t his .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : It ’s int erest ing .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , um , you know , in [ disfm arker] in JRASTA we were
essent ially adding in , uh , whit e [ disfm arker] uh , whit e noise
dependent on our est im at e of t he noise .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ e] : On t he overall est im at e of t he noise .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , I t hink it never occurred t o us t o use a probabilit y in
t here .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : You could im agine one t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat m ade use of where [ disfm arker] where t he am ount t hat you
added in was , uh , a funct ion of t he probabilit y of it being s speech or
noise .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ bk|%−−] : Yeah , w
m n007 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , right now it ’s a const ant t hat just depending
on t he [ disfm arker] t he noise spect rum .
m n052 [ %] : There ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ s] : Cuz t hat [ disfm arker] t hat brings in sort of powers of
classifiers t hat we don’t really have in , uh , t his ot her est im at e .
m n007 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So it could be [ disfm arker] it could be int erest ing .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : What [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker] what point does
t he , uh , sy st em st op recording ?
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : How m uch [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : It ’ll keep going t ill [ disfm arker] I guess when t hey run out

m e013 [ qy^ d] : It went a lit t le long ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , disk [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : I t hink we ’re OK .
m n007 [ b] : So .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fg] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , so t here are [ disfm arker] wit h t his t echnique
t here are som e [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : I just did som et hing exact ly t he sam e as [ disfm arker] as
t he Ericsson proposal
m n007 [ s] : but , um , [ vocalsound] t he probabilit y of speech is not

m n007 [ s] : And I t hink , i for [ disfm arker] yeah , for a lot of t hings ,
act ually a g a good speech probabilit y is im port ant .
m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : Like for fram e dropping you im prove , like
[ disfm arker] you can im prove from t en percent as Sunil showed , if you
use t he channel zero speech probabilit ies .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : For t his it m ight help ,
m n007 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : S so , yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Uh ,
m n007 [ fh] : so yeah ,
m n007 [ s] : t he nex t t hing I st art ed t o do is t o , [ vocalsound] uh , t ry t o

m n007 [ %−−] : I d
m n007 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]

m n007 [ s^ bk|s] : y eah , for t his I t hink we can m aybe t ry t o t rain t he

, including all t he SpeechDat − Car dat a .
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : And so I ’m st art ing t o obt ain alignm ent s on t hese

m n007 [ fh|s] : Um , and t he way I m i I do t hat is t hat I just use t he HTK

m n007 [ s] : And t hen I aligned [ disfm arker] I obt ained t he Vit erbi

m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s.%−−] : It seem s t o be ,
m n007 [ fh] : uh i
m n007 [ s] : Act ually what I observed is t hat for It alian it doesn’t seem
[ disfm arker] Th − t here seem s t o be a problem .
m n052 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n007 [ fh] : Well .
m n052 [ s] : So , it doesn’t seem s t o help by t heir use of channel zero
or channel one .
m n007 [ %−] : Because [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ qw^ br] : What ?
m n052 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g] : Uh , you m ean t heir d t he fram e dropping ,
right ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , it doesn’t [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So , u but act ually t he VAD was t rained on It alian also ,
m n052 [ s^ 2] : It alian .
m n007 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker] Um ,
m n007 [ s^ bu|qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : t he c t he current VAD t hat we have was
t rained on , uh , t SPINE , right ?
m n007 [ s^ e.%−−] : It alian , and TI − digit s wit h noise and [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : TI − digit s .
m n052 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Uh , yeah .
m n007 [ s] : And it seem s t o work on It alian but not on t he Finnish and

m n007 [ fh|s^ df] : So , m aybe one reason is t hat s s Finnish and

m n007 [ fh] : And
m n007 [ s] : act ually we observed [ disfm arker] we list ened t o som e of

m n007 [ qy^ d^ g] : right ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]

m n007 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , so t he idea was t o t rain all t he dat abases and

m n007 [ fh] : and , um ,
m n007 [ s] : also t o , um , t ry different kind of feat ures , [ vocalsound]
uh , as input t o t he VAD net work .
m n007 [ fh] : And
m n007 [ s] : we cam e up wit h a bunch of feat ures t hat we want t o t ry

m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : The energy also .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : The energy .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Of course .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , right .
