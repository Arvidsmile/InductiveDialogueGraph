m e011 [ s] : It did crash , so I feel m uch bet t er , earlier .
m e013 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Int erest ing .
m e013 [ qy^ cs^ rt ] : Will you get t he door ,
fe008 [ %] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ fg] : OK .
m e011 [ fg] : OK , so um .
m e013 [ s^ bu|qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : You collect ed an agenda , huh ?
m e011 [ s^ na^ rt ] : I did collect an agenda .
m e011 [ s] : So I ’m gonna go first .
m e011 [ s^ fe] : Mwa − ha − ha !
m e011 [ s] : It shouldn’t t ake t oo long .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Um , so we ’re pret t y m uch out of digit s .
m e011 [ s] : We ’ve gone once t hrough t he set .
m e011 [ s.%−] : Um , so t he only t hing I have t o do
m e013 [ s^ ar|s] : No t here ’s only t en .
m e011 [ s^ na] : Yeah , t hat ’s right .
m e011 [ s] : so I [ disfm arker] I just have t o go t hrough t hem
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Well , OK .
m e011 [ fh|s] : and uh pick out t he ones t hat hav e problem s ,
m e011 [ s] : and eit her correct t hem or hav e t hem re − read .
m e011 [ s] : So we probably hav e like four or five m ore form s t o be read
, t o be once t hrough t he set .
m e011 [ s] : I ’v e also ext ract ed out about an hour ’s wort h .
m e011 [ s] : We have about t wo hours wort h .
m e011 [ s] : I ex t ract ed out about an hour ’s wort h
m e011 [ s] : which are t he f digit s wit h [ disfm arker] for which whose
speaker have speaker form s ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : have filled out speaker form s .
m e011 [ s] : Not everyone ’s filled out a speaker form .
m e011 [ s] : So I ext ract ed one for speakers who have speaker form s
m e011 [ s] : and for m eet ings in which t he " key " file and t he t ranscript
files are parsable .
m e011 [ s] : Som e of t he early key files , it looks like , were done by
hand ,
m e011 [ s] : and so t hey ’re not aut om at ically parsable
m e011 [ s] : and I have t o go back and fix t hose .
m e011 [ s] : So what t hat m eans is we have about an hour of
t ranscribed digit s t hat we can play wit h .
m e011 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So you t hink t wo [ disfm arker] you t hink t wo hours is
t he [ disfm arker] is t he t ot al t hat we have ?

m e011 [ %−] : Liz [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep ,
m e011 [ s^ aa] : yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And y ou t hink we t h uh ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : I [ disfm arker] I didn’t quit e cat ch all t hese different
t hings t hat are not quit e right ,
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : but you t hink we ’ll be able t o ret rieve t he ot her
hour , reasonably ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yes , absolut ely .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : So it ’s just a quest ion of a lit t le hand − edit ing of som e
files
m e011 [ s] : and t hen wait ing for m ore people t o t urn in t heir speaker
form s .
m e011 [ s] : I hav e t his web − based speaker form ,
m e011 [ s] : and I sent m ail t o everyone who hadn’t filled out a speaker
form ,
m e011 [ s] : and t hey ’re slowly s t rickling in .
m e013 [ s^ bu.%−] : So t he relev ance of t he speaker form here , s
m e011 [ s] : It ’s for labeling t he ex t ract ed audio files .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e011 [ s^ e] : By speaker ID and m icrophone t ype .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : Wasn’t like whet her t hey were giving us perm ission t o
use t heir digit s or som et hing .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s] : No , I spoke wit h Jane about t hat
m e011 [ s.%−−] : and we sort of decided t hat it ’s probably not an issue
t hat [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : We edit out any of t he errors anyway . Right ?
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So t he t here are no errors in t he digit s ,
m e011 [ s] : y ou ’ll always read t he st ring correct ly .
m e011 [ s] : So I can’t im agine why any one would care .
m e011 [ s^ t ^ t c.%−−] : So t he ot her t opic wit h digit s is uh ,
m e011 [ s] : Liz would like t o elicit different prosodics ,
m e011 [ s] : and so we t ried last week wit h t hem writ t en out in English .
m e011 [ s] : And it just didn’t work at all
m e011 [ s^ df] : because no one grouped t hem t oget her .
m e011 [ s] : So it just sounded like m any m any m ore lines inst ead of
anyt hing else .
m e011 [ s] : So in conversat ions wit h Liz and uh Jane we decided t hat if
y ou wrot e t hem out as num bers inst ead of words it would elicit m ore
phone num ber , social securit y num ber − like readings .
m e011 [ s] : The problem wit h t hat is it becom es num bers inst ead of
digit s .
m e011 [ s] : When I look at t his , t hat first line is " sixt y one , sixt y t wo ,
eight een , eight y six , t en . "

m e011 [ qh] : Um , and so t he quest ion is does anyone care ?
m e011 [ s] : Um , I ’ve already spoken wit h Liz and she feels t hat ,
correct m e if I ’m wrong , t hat for her , connect ed num bers is fine ,
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ e] : as opposed t o connect ed digit s .
m e011 [ s] : Um , I t hink t wo hours is probably fine for a t est set ,
m e011 [ s] : but it m ay be a lit t le short if we act ually wanna do t raining
and adapt at ion and all t hat ot her st uff .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah
m e013 [ fg] : Um , do um
m e013 [ s] : you want different prosodics ,
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : so if you always had t he sam e groupings you
wouldn’t like t hat ?
m e013 [ qy] : Is t hat correct ?
fe016 [ s.%−−] : Well , we act ually figured out a way t o [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg|%−] : Yeah , t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] t he groupings are random ly generat ed .
m e013 [ s^ ar|s] : No but , I was asking if t hat was som et hing you really
cared about
m e013 [ s^ df] : because if it wasn’t , it seem s t o m e if you m ade it
really specifically t elephone groupings t hat m aybe people wouldn’t , uh
, go and do num bers so m uch .
m e013 [ s.%−] : You know if it if it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ ng] : I t hink t hey m ay st ill do it ,
m n014 [ %−−] : Uh [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ s^ aap^ am |s^ ng] : Maybe som e , but I probably not so m uch .
m e018 [ qh^ cs] : What about put t ing a hyphen bet ween t he num bers
in t he group ?
fe016 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e013 [ s.%−] : So if you [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] if you have uh
m e011 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : Six dash one , you m ean ?
m e013 [ s] : if y ou go six six six uh dash uh t wo nine t hree one .
fe016 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] well OK [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] it
m ight help ,
fe016 [ s^ am ] : I would like t o g get away from having only one specific
grouping .
m e013 [ s|s^ bk] : That ’s what I was asking , yeah .
fe016 [ fh|s] : Um , so if t hat ’s y our quest ion ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ df] : but I m ean it seem s t o m e t hat , at least for us , we can
learn t o read t hem as digit s
fe016 [ s] : if t hat ’s what people want .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker] I ’m

fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : don’t t hink t hat ’d be t hat hard t o read t hem as single
digit s .
fe008 [ s^ na] : I agree .
fe016 [ fh] : Um ,
fe016 [ s] : and it seem s like t hat m ight be bet t er for you guys
fe016 [ s^ df] : since t hen you ’ll hav e just m ore digit dat a ,
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s] : and t hat ’s always a good t hing .
fe016 [ s] : It ’s a lit t le bit bet t er for m e t oo
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
fe016 [ s^ df] : because t he digit s are easier t o recognize .
fe016 [ s^ df^ e] : They ’re bet t er t rained t han t he num bers .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ cs:s] : So we could just , uh , put in t he inst ruct ions " read
t hem as digit s " .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Right . Right , read t hem as single digit s ,
fe016 [ s:s] : so sixt y − one w is read as six one ,
fe008 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s.%−] : and if people m ake a m ist ake we [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qw] : How about " O " versus " zero " ?
m e013 [ s^ cs^ ng] : I m ean , t he ot her t hing is we could just bag it
m e013 [ s^ df.%−−] : because it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : it ’s − I ’m not worry ing about it
m e013 [ s^ df] : I m ean , because we do have digit s t raining dat a t hat
we hav e from uh from OGI .
m e013 [ s^ fa] : I ’m sorry ,
m e013 [ s^ bsc] : digit s [ disfm arker] num bers t raining t hat we have
from OGI ,
m e013 [ s] : we ’v e done lot s and lot s of st udies wit h t hat .
m e013 [ fh] : And um .
fe016 [ s^ df.%−] : But it ’s nice t o get it in t his room wit h t he acous
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−] : I m ean [ disfm arker] for [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : No , no , I guess what I ’m saying is t hat
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Just let t hem read it how t hey read it .
m e013 [ s] : t o som e ext ent m aybe we could just read t hem
[ disfm arker] hav e t hem read how [ disfm arker] how t hey read it
m e013 [ s] : and it just m eans t hat we have t o expand our [ disfm arker]
our v ocabulary out t o st uff t hat we already have .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ na] : Well t hat ’s fine wit h m e as long as [ disfm arker] It ’s just
t hat I didn’t want t o cause t he people who would have been collect ing
digit s t he ot her way t o not have t he digit s .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s^ df] : We can go back t o t he ot her t hing lat er .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean we s we [ disfm arker] we ’ve [ disfm arker] We can do
t his for awhile
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : and t hen go back t o digit s for awhile ,
m e013 [ fh] : or um .
m e013 [ qy] : Do y o I m ean , do you want [ disfm arker] do you want t his
[ disfm arker] Do you need t raining dat a or adapt at ion dat a out of t his ?
fe016 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ qw] : How m uch of t his do y ou need ?
m e013 [ s^ e.%−−] : wit h uh t he [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ no] : It ’s act ually unclear right now .
fe016 [ s] : I just t hought well we ’re [ disfm arker] if we ’re collec
collect ing digit s , and Adam had said we were running out of t he TI
form s , I t hought it ’d be nice t o have t hem in groups ,
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : and probably , all else being equal , it ’d be bet t er for m e
t o just have single digit s
fe016 [ s^ df] : since it ’s , you know , a recognizer ’s gonna do bet t er
on t hose anyway ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s^ df^ e] : um , and it ’s m ore predict able .
fe016 [ s] : So we can know from t he t ranscript what t he person said
and t he t ranscriber , in general .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s.%−] : OK , well if y ou pre
fe016 [ s] : But if t hey m ake m ist akes , it ’s no big deal
fe016 [ s^ e:s] : if t he people say a hundred inst ead of " one OO " .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : and also w m aybe we can just let t hem choose " zero "
v ersus " O " as t hey [ disfm arker] as t hey like
fe016 [ s^ df:s] : because even t he sam e person c som et im es says " O "
and som et im es says " zero " in different cont ext ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : and t hat ’s sort of int erest ing .
fe016 [ s^ bd] : So I don’t have a Specific need
fe016 [ s^ df] : cuz if I did I ’d probably t ry t o collect it , you know ,
wit hout bot hering t his group ,
fe016 [ s.%−] : but If we can t ry it [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg|s^ cs] : OK so [ disfm arker] so I can just add t o t he
inst ruct ions t o read it as digit s
m e011 [ s] : not as connect ed num bers .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : Right , and you can give an exam ple
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s:s] : like , y ou know , " six [ disfm arker] sixt y − one would be
read as six one " .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s] : And I t hink people will get it .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

fe008 [ s] : And i act ually it ’s no m ore art ificial t han what we ’ve been
doing wit h words .
fe008 [ s] : I ’m sure people can adapt t o t his ,
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right , right .
fe008 [ s^ e] : read it single .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : It ’s just easier t o read .
fe008 [ s] : The spaces already bias it t oward being separat ed .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : And I know I ’m gonna find t his easier t han words .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Oh yeah , absolut ely ,
fe016 [ fg] : OK
m e011 [ s^ e] : cognit ively it ’s m uch easier .
fe016 [ s] : I also had a hard [ disfm arker] hard t im e wit h t he words ,
fe016 [ s] : but t hen we went back and fort h on t hat .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : OK , so let ’s give t hat a t ry
m e011 [ s^ bk|qr] : OK . And is t he spacing alright or do you t hink t here
should be m ore space bet ween digit s and groups ?
m e013 [ b] : OK .
fe016 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ qw] : I m ean what do ot her people t hink
m e011 [ qrr] : Or is t hat alright ?
fe016 [ s^ df] : cuz you guys are reading [ com m ent ] t hem .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : I t hink t hat i it ’s fine .
fe008 [ s] : I it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] t o m e it looks like you ’ve got
t he func t he idea of grouping and you have t he grou t he idea of
separat ion
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : and , y ou know , it ’s just a m at t er of u i t he inst ruct ions ,
t hat ’s all .
fe016 [ s^ ba|s^ bk] : Great . OK .
fe016 [ s] : Well let ’s give it a t ry .
m e011 [ s] : And I t hink t here are about t en different gouping pat t erns
m e013 [ s] : Let ’s t ry it .
m e011 [ qy ] : isn’t t hat right , Liz ?
fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : Righ − right , and you just [ disfm arker] t hey ’re
random ly [ nonv ocalsound] generat ed and random ly assigned t o digit s
.
m e011 [ s^ e] : That we did .
fe008 [ s.%−] : I did [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : So we have [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ fa] : Sorry ,
fe008 [ s^ co] : Go ahead .

m e013 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I was just gonna say , so we have in t he
v icinit y of fort y hours of [ disfm arker] of recordings now .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : And you ’re saying t wo hours , uh , is digit s ,
m e013 [ s^ bu] : so t hat ’s roughly t he rat io t hen ,
m e013 [ s] : som et hing like t went y [ disfm arker] t went y t o one .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e013 [ s] : Which I guess m akes [ disfm arker] m akes sense .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So if we did anot her fort y hours of recordings t hen we
could get anot her couple hours of t his .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : Um , yeah like you say , I t hink a couple hours for a
[ disfm arker] for a [ disfm arker] for a t est [ disfm arker] t est set ’s OK .
m e013 [ s] : It ’d be nice t o get , y ou know , m ore lat er
m e013 [ s^ df] : because we ’ll [ disfm arker] we m ight use [ disfm arker]
use t his up , uh , in som e sense ,
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker] but uh [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe008 [ fg|s^ na] : Yeah , I also would like t o argue for t hat
fe008 [ s^ df] : cuz it [ disfm arker] it seem s t o m e t hat , um , t here ’s a
real st rengt h in having t he sam e t est replicat ed in [ disfm arker] a
whole bunch of t im es
fe008 [ s^ df^ e] : and adding t o t hat basic t est bank .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ bk.%] : Hm m ?
fe008 [ s^ df] : Cuz t hen you have , you know , m ore and m ore , u
chances t o get away from random errors .
fe008 [ s] : And I t hink , um , t he ot her t hing t oo is t hat right now we
have sort of a st rat ified sam ple wit h reference t o dialect groups ,
fe008 [ s] : and it m ight be [ disfm arker] t here m ight be an argum ent t o
be m ade for hav ing uh f for replicat ing all of t he digit s t hat we ’ve done
,
fe008 [ s] : which were done by non − nat ive speakers
fe008 [ s] : so t hat we have a core t hat t ot ally replicat es t he original
dat a set ,
fe008 [ s] : which is t ot ally Am erican speakers ,
fe008 [ s] : and t hen we have t hese st rat ified addit ional language
groups ov erlapping cert ain aspect s of t he dat abase .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ ng] : I t hink t hat uh t rying t o duplicat e , spending t oo m uch
effort t ry ing t o duplicat e t he exist ing TI − digit s probably isn’t t oo
wort hwhile
m e011 [ s^ df] : because t he recording sit uat ion is so different .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ df^ e] : It ’s gonna be very hard t o be com parable .

fe008 [ s^ df^ nd] : Except t hat if you have t he st im uli [ pause]
com parable , t hen it says som et hing about t he [ disfm arker] t he
cont ribut ion of set t ing
m e013 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : No it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not t he sam e .
m e013 [ s^ aap] : A lit t le bit ,
fe008 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ nd] : but t he ot her differences are so m ajor .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s.%−] : They ’re such m ajor sources of variance t hat it ’s
[ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s uh [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah I m ean read versus not .
fe008 [ qw] : What ’s an exam ple of a [ disfm arker] of m som e of t he
ot her differences ?
fe008 [ qo^ e] : Any ot her a difference ?
m e013 [ s] : Well i i individual hum an glot t is [ vocalsound] is going t o be
different for each one ,
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : y ou know , it ’s just [ disfm arker] There ’s so m any t hings .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : it ’s [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and
enunciat ion .
m e011 [ s^ na] : Well , and not just t hat ,
m e011 [ s] : I m ean t he uh t he corpus it self .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , we ’re collect ing it in a read digit in a part icular list
,
m e011 [ s] : and I ’m sure t hat t hey ’re doing m ore specific st uff .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean if I rem em ber correct ly it was like post m an reading
zipcodes and t hings like t hat .
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d] : TI − digit s was ?
m e013 [ s^ df^ ng] : I t hought [ disfm arker] I t hought it was read .
m e011 [ s^ na] : I t hought so .
m e011 [ qy] : Was it read ?
m e013 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , I t hink t he reading zipcode st uff you ’re
t hinking of would be OGI .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh , I m ay well be .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah , no TI − digit s was read in t h in read in t he st udio I
believ e .
m e011 [ s^ df] : I haven’t ever list ened t o TI − digit s .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So I don’t really know how it com pares .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−] : But it [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but regardless it ’s gonna [ disfm arker] it
’s hard t o com pare cross − corpus .
m e013 [ s] : It − it ’s different people [ pause] is t he [ disfm arker] is t he
core t hing .

m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s] : And t hey ’re different circum st ances wit h different
recording environm ent and so fort h ,
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK , fine .
m e013 [ s] : so it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s really pret t y
different .
m e013 [ s] : But I t hink t he idea of using a set t hing was just t o give
y ou som e sort of fram ework ,
m e013 [ s] : so t hat even t hough you couldn’t do exact com parisons , it
wouldn’t be s v alid scient ifically at least it ’d give you som e kind of uh
fram e of reference .
m e013 [ s.%−] : Uh , you know it ’s not [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ fg|qw] : Hey Liz , What [ disfm arker] what do t he groupings
represent ?
m e018 [ s^ e] : You said t here ’s like t en different groupings ?
fe016 [ s^ aa|s^ rt ] : Right , just groupings in t erm s of num ber of groups
in a line ,
fe016 [ s^ e] : and num ber of digit s in a group ,
fe016 [ s] : and t he pat t ern of groupings .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ qo.%−−] : Are t he pat t erns [ disfm arker] like are t hey based on
anyt hing or
fe016 [ h|s] : Um , I [ disfm arker] I just roughly looked at what kinds of
digit st rings are out t here ,
fe016 [ s] : and t hey ’re usually grouped int o eit her t wo , t hree , or four
, four digit s at a t im e .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : And t hey can have ,
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , act ually , t hings are get t ing longer and longer .
fe016 [ s] : In t he old days you probably only had t hree sequences ,
and t elephone num bers were less , and so fort h .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : So , t here ’s bet ween , um [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : Well if y ou look at it , t here are bet ween like t hree and five
groups ,
fe016 [ s] : and each one has bet ween t wo and four groupings
fe016 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : I purposely didn’t want t hem t o look like t hey were in any
kind of pat t ern .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
fe016 [ fh] : So
m e011 [ s] : And which group appears is picked random ly , and what
t he num bers are are picked random ly .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .

m e011 [ s] : So unlike t he previous one , which I d sim ply replicat ed TI −
digit s , t his is generat ed random ly .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm m , oh , OK .
m n014 [ s^ bk] : Oh OK .
fe016 [ s] : But I t hink it ’d be great i t o be able t o com pare digit s ,
fe016 [ s] : whet her it ’s t hese digit s or TI − digit s , t o speakers , um ,
and com pare t hat t o t heir spont aneous speech ,
fe016 [ s] : and t hen we do need you know a fair am ount of
[ disfm arker] of digit dat a
fe016 [ s^ df] : because you m ight be wearing a different m icrophone
fe016 [ s] : and , I m ean [ disfm arker] so it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s nice t o
have t he digit s you know , replicat ed m any t im es .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : Especially for speakers t hat don’t t alk a lot .
fe016 [ fh] : So [ vocalsound] um ,
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ e] : for adapt at ion .
fe016 [ s^ ar|s^ df] : No , I ’m serious ,
fe016 [ s] : so we hav e a problem wit h acoust ic adapt at ion ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah all we have for som e people is digit s .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : and we ’re not using t he digit dat a now ,
fe016 [ %−] : but y ou know [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ bu] : Oh , you ’re not .
fe016 [ s^ na|s^ aa] : Not for adapt at ion , nope .
fe016 [ s] : v W we ’re not [ disfm arker] we were running adapt at ion only
on t he dat a t hat we ran recognit ion on
fe016 [ s] : and I ’d [ disfm arker] As soon as som eone st art ed t o read
t ranscript num ber , t hat ’s read speech
fe016 [ s:s] : and I t hought " well , we ’re gonna do bet t er on t hat ,
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh I see .
fe016 [ s] : t hat ’s not fair t o use " .
m e011 [ s^ a|s^ na] : Oh yeah t hat ’s t rue , absolut ely .
fe016 [ s] : But , it m ight be fair t o use t he dat a for adapt at ion ,
m n014 [ s^ bk.%] : OK .
fe016 [ fh] : so .
fe016 [ s.%−] : So t hose speakers who are very quiet , [ com m ent ] shy
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ba] : That would be int erest ing t o see whet her t hat helps .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : r Right [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy .%−] : Do y ou t hink t hat would help adapt ing on [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ j] : Like Adam ?
m e011 [ s^ aa^ j] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa^ j] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa^ j|s^ j^ na] : Yeah , I hav e a real problem wit h t hat .

fe016 [ s^ df.%−−] : Well , it sh I m ean it ’s t he sam e m icropho
fe016 [ s] : see t he nice t hing is we have t hat in t he [ disfm arker] in t he
sam e m eet ing ,
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ b.%] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−] : and so you don’t get [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Sam e [ disfm arker] sam e acoust ics ,
m e011 [ s] : sam e m icrophone ,
m e011 [ s] : sam e channel .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : Right , and so I st ill like t he idea of having som e kind
of [ pause] digit dat a .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Good .
m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah I m ean , for t he [ disfm arker] for t he um
acoust ic research ,
m e013 [ s] : for t he signal − processing , farfield st uff , I see it as
[ disfm arker] as [ disfm arker] as t he place t hat we st art .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : But , t h I m ean , it ’d be nice t o have t went y hours of
digit s dat a ,
m e013 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] but uh t he t rut h is I ’m hoping t hat we
[ disfm arker] we t hrough t he [ disfm arker] t he st uff t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat y ou guy s have been doing as y ou cont inue t hat , we get , uh , t he
best we can do on t he spont aneous st uff uh , uh nearfield ,
m e013 [ s] : and t hen um , we do a lot of t he t est ing of t he algorit hm s
on t he digit s for t he farfield ,
m e013 [ s] : and at som e point when we feel it ’s m at ure and we
underst and what ’s going on wit h it t hen we [ disfm arker] we have t o
m ov e on t o t he spont aneous dat a wit h t he farfield .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : The only t hing t hat we don’t have ,
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Great .
fe016 [ s^ bd^ df] : I know t his sounds weird ,
fe016 [ s^ bd^ e] : and m aybe it ’s com plet ely st upid ,
fe016 [ s] : but we don’t have any overlapping digit s .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , we t alked about t hat a couple t im es .
fe016 [ s^ df] : An − yea I know it ’s weird ,
fe016 [ %−] : but um [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s] : Overlapping digit s !
m e011 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he problem I see wit h t rying t o do
ov erlapping digit s is t he cognit iv e load .
fe016 [ s^ bk|s] : Alright everybody ’s laughing .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e001 [ s^ j] : Dueling digit s .
m e011 [ s^ ar|s^ bd^ df] : No it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not st upid ,
m e011 [ s^ cs] : it ’s just [ disfm arker] I m ean , t ry t o do it .

fe016 [ s^ df] : I ’m just t alkin for t he st uff t hat like Dan Ellis is gonna t ry
,
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , here , let ’s t ry it .
fe016 [ s^ e] : you know , cross − t alk cancellat ion .
m e013 [ s^ na] : Let ’s t ry it .
m e011 [ s^ co] : You read t he last line , I ’ll read t he first line .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n014 [ s^ bk.%] : Oh !
fe016 [ s] : Wait [ disfm arker] oh it [ disfm arker] t hese are all t he sam e
form s .
m e013 [ s] : Sixt y − one .
fe016 [ s^ bk|%−] : OK [ com m ent ] So but [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ co^ r] : So [ disfm arker] so you read t he last line , I ’ll read
t he first line .
fe016 [ s^ co] : So y ou plu you plug your ears .
m e013 [ s^ ar|%−] : No , I ’ll p
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh I guess if you plug you ’re ears you could do it ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : but t hen you don’t get t he [ disfm arker] t he sam e
effect s .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : Well , what I m ean is act ually no not t he overlaps t hat are
well − gov erned linguist ically ,
fe016 [ s] : but t he act ual fact t hat t here is speech com ing from t wo
people
fe016 [ s.%−−] : and t he beam − form ing st uf
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : all t he acoust ic st uff t hat like Dan Ellis and [ disfm arker] and
com pany want t o do .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh I see .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : Digit s are nice and well behaved ,
fe016 [ fh] : I m ean
fe016 [ s^ bd] : Anyway , it ’s just a t hought .
m e011 [ s^ am ^ cs] : I guess we could t ry .
m e011 [ s^ cs^ e] : We could t ry doing som e .
fe016 [ s^ df] : It [ disfm arker] it would go fast er .
m e018 [ s^ na] : Parallel .
fe016 [ s.%−] : It would t ake one around [ com m ent ] am ount of t i
m e018 [ s^ j] : It ’s t he P − m ake of digit reading .
m e011 [ fg|s^ cs] : Well [ disfm arker] Well OK . Well let ’s t ry it .
fe016 [ s^ na] : That ’s right .
fe016 [ s^ bd] : I [ disfm arker] I m ea I ’m [ disfm arker] I was sort of
serious ,
fe016 [ s^ bd] : but I really , I m ean , I ’m [ disfm arker] I don’t feel
st rongly enough t hat it ’s a good idea ,
m e013 [ %−] : See , y
m e011 [ s^ co] : You do t he last line , I ’ll do t he first line .

fe016 [ fh] : so .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : O . [ com m ent ] That ’s not bad .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : No , I can do it .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : A and t hat prosody was great , by t he way .
m e018 [ s] : I couldn’t underst and a single t hing you guys were saying .
fe008 [ s^ j] : I t hink it was num bers ,
fe008 [ s^ j] : but I ’m not sure .
fe016 [ s] : It [ disfm arker] it sort of sounded like a duet , or som et hing .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : Perform ance art .
m e013 [ fg|s^ cs] : Alright , let ’s t ry t hree at once you [ disfm arker] you
pick one in t he m iddle .
m n014 [ s^ j] : The Aurora t heat er .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ co] : Go .
fe016 [ s^ fa] : I ’m sorry .
fe016 [ s] : I ’m m ean I t hink it ’s doable ,
m e011 [ s^ ba] : The poor t ranscribers
fe016 [ s^ df.%−] : I ’m just [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : t hey ’re gonna hat e us .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : So , we [ disfm arker] we could have a round like where
y ou do t wo at a t im e ,
fe016 [ s^ cs] : and t hen t he next person picks up when t he first guy ’s
done , or som et hing .
m n014 [ s] : So pairwise .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh like a round ,
m e013 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : yeah , like in a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−] : Like a ,
m n014 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , just pairwise ,
m e013 [ fh] : yeah .
fe016 [ qw] : what do you call it ?
fe016 [ s.%−] : Li − a r like [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : A round .
m n014 [ %−−] : or
m e013 [ s^ rt :s^ rt ] : Row , row , row your boat .
m e001 [ s] : Round .
m n014 [ b] : y eah .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : y eah , like t hat .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s] : It ’s gonna require som e coordinat ion .
fe016 [ s] : Then it would go like h t wice as fast , or [ pause] a t hird as
fast .
fe016 [ s^ bd] : Any way , it ’s just a t hought .

fe008 [ s] : You hav e t o have a sim ilar pace .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : I ’m act ually sort of serious if it would help people do
t hat kind o
fe016 [ s^ df] : but t he people who wanna work on it we should t alk t o
t hem .
m e013 [ s] : I don’t t hink we ’re gonna collect vast am ount s of dat a
t hat way ,
fe016 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ b.%] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : but I t hink having a lit t le bit m ight at least be fun for
som ebody like Dan t o play around wit h ,
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : I t hink m aybe if we want ed t o do t hat we would do it as
a separat e session ,
m e013 [ b] : y eah .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ e] : som et hing like t hat
m e011 [ s^ e] : rat her t han doing it during a real m eet ing
m e011 [ s] : and y ou know , do t wo people at a t im e
m e011 [ s^ e] : t hen t hree people at a t im e and t hings like t hat .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : Can t ry it out .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : If we have not hing [ disfm arker] if we have no agenda we
could do it som e week .
m e011 [ s] : See [ disfm arker] see what Dan t hinks .
m e011 [ s^ aa^ j] : Yeah , right .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : Spend t he whole t im e reading digit s wit h different qu
quant it ies .
fe008 [ qy] : c c Can I can I have an anot her [ disfm arker] anot her
quest ion w about t his ?
m e011 [ s] : I t hought t his was gonna be fast .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Oh well .
fe008 [ s] : So , um , t here are t hese digit s ,
fe008 [ s] : which are det ached digit s ,
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : but t here are ot her words t hat cont ain t he sam e
general phon phonem e sequences .
fe008 [ s:s] : Like " wonderful " has " one " in it
fe008 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and Vict or Borge had a [ disfm arker] had a
piece on t his where he inflat ed t he digit s .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : Well , I wonder if t here ’s , um , an if t here would be a
v alue in having digit s t hat are in essence em bedded in real words t o
com pare in t erm s of like t he art iculat ion of " one " in " wonderful "
v ersus " one " as a digit being read .

m e013 [ s^ ba^ j] : That ’s " t wo " bad .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ j^ na] : I ’m all " four " it .
fe008 [ s] : There you go .
m e011 [ s^ j^ nd] : Not aft er I " eight " t hough .
m e013 [ s^ ba|qy^ g^ rt ] : Uh , t hey don’t all work as well , do t hey ?
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ qw] : What does nine work in ?
m e011 [ h] : Uh .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e001 [ s^ ar^ fe^ j] : Nein !
m e001 [ s] : You scream it .
m e011 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Nein !
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh . In Germ an ,
m e011 [ s^ j] : You have t o be Germ an ,
m e018 [ s^ ba] : It ’s great for t he Germ ans .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : yeah .
m n014 [ s.%] : That ’s Germ an , yeah .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Oh , oh !
m e011 [ b] : y eah .
fe008 [ s^ m ] : Nein .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right !
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Oh !
m e001 [ s^ r] : It only sounds w good when you scream it , t hough .
m e001 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink everybody ’s a lit t le punchy here [ vocalsound] t oday
.
fe008 [ s^ bd^ df] : Well , I m ean , I just want ed t o offer t hat as a
possible t ask
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yes .
fe008 [ s^ df] : because , you know , if we were t o each read his
em bedded num bers words in sent in sent ences
fe008 [ s] : cuz it ’s like an ent ire sket ch he does
fe008 [ s] : and I wouldn’t t ake t he inflat ed version .
fe008 [ s] : So he t alks about t he wom an being " t wo − derful " ,
fe008 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] a But , you know , if it were t o be deflat ed ,
just t he norm al word , it would be like a lit t le st ory t hat we could read .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ no] : I don’t know if it would be useful for com parison ,
fe008 [ s^ df] : but it ’s em bedded num bers .
m e013 [ s^ no] : Well I don’t know .
m e011 [ s] : I t hink for som et hing like t hat we ’d be bet t er off doing like
uh TIMIT .
m e013 [ s] : Well I t hink t he quest ion is what t he research is ,

m e013 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : so I m ean , I presum e t hat t he reason t hat you
want ed t o hav e t hese digit s t his way is because you want ed t o act ually
do som e research looking at t he prosodic form here .
m e011 [ b] : Hm m .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right , yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah OK .
m e013 [ s] : So if som ebody want ed t o do t hat , if t hey want ed t o look
at t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he difference of t he uh phones in
t he digit s in t he cont ext of a word v ersus uh t he digit s [ disfm arker] a
[ disfm arker] a non − digit word versus in digit word , uh t hat would be a
good t hing t o do ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : but I t hink som eone would have t o ex press int erest in
t hat .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ s.%−] : I t hink , t o [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean if you were int erest ed in it t hen we could do it , for
inst ance .
fe008 [ s^ bk|s^ ft ] : OK , t hank you .
fe008 [ b] : Huh .
m e011 [ fg|qy ^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : OK , are we done wit h digit s ?
m e011 [ fh] : Um ,
m e011 [ s^ t ] : We hav e ASR result s from Liz ,
m e011 [ s^ t ] : t ranscript st at us from Jane ,
m e011 [ s^ t ] : and disk space and st orage form at s from Don .
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Does [ disfm arker] do we have any prefer preference
on which way we wanna [ disfm arker] we wanna go ?
fe016 [ s] : Well I was act ually gonna skip t he ASR result s part , in favor
of get t ing t he t ranscript ion st uff t alked about
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ df] : since I t hink t hat ’s m ore im port ant t o m oving forward ,
fe016 [ s] : but I m ean Morgan has t his paper copy
fe016 [ s.%−−] : and if people have quest ions ,
fe016 [ s] : um , it ’s pret t y prelim inary in t erm s of ASR result s
fe016 [ s^ df] : because we didn’t do any t hing fancy ,
fe016 [ s] : but I t hink e just having t he result s t here ,
fe016 [ s] : and point ing out som e m ain conclusions
fe016 [ s] : like it ’s not t he speaking st yle t hat differs ,
fe016 [ s] : it ’s t he fact t hat t here ’s overlap t hat causes recognit ion
errors .
fe016 [ s] : And t hen , t he fact t hat it ’s alm ost all insert ion errors ,
fe016 [ s] : which you would ex pect
fe016 [ s] : but y ou m ight also t hink t hat in t he overlapped regions you
would get subst it ut ions and so fort h ,

fe016 [ fh|s] : um , leads us t o believe t hat doing a bet t er
segm ent at ion , like your channel − based segm ent at ion , or som e kind
of uh , echo cancellat ion t o get basically back down t o t he individual
speaker ut t erances would be probably all t hat we would need t o be
able t o do good recognit ion on t he [ disfm arker] on t he close − t alking
m ikes .
m e011 [ qh] : Um , why don’t you , if y ou have a hard copy , why don’t
y ou em ail it t o t he list .
m n014 [ s.%−] : So t hese [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : So , t hat ’s about t he sum m ary [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : But t his is [ disfm arker] Morgan has t his paper .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah , yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−] : I m ean he [ disfm arker] he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk|qy ] : Yeah , so it ’s t he sam e t hing ?
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh it ’s in t he paper .
fe016 [ s^ na] : it [ disfm arker] it ’s t hat paper .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : It ’s t he sam e t hing I m ailed t o every everybody t hat w
where it was ,
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
fe016 [ s] : So , we basically , um , did a lot of work on t hat
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : OK t hen , it ’s already been m ailed .
m e013 [ b.%] : yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : and it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : Let ’s see , t h
fe016 [ s] : I guess t he ot her neat t hing is it shows for sure w t hat t he
lapel , y ou know wit hin speaker is bad .
m e011 [ qy ^ 2^ bu^ d] : Horrible ?
fe016 [ s] : And it ’s bad because it picks up t he overlapping speech .
m n014 [ s^ bu] : So , your [ disfm arker] your ASR result s were run on t he
channels synchronized ,
fe016 [ s^ aa|s^ df^ rt ] : Yes , cuz t hat ’s all t hat w had been t ranscribed
at t he t im e ,
m n014 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n014 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n014 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ fh] : um
fe016 [ s] : but as we [ disfm arker] I m ean I want ed t o here m ore about
t he t ranscript ion .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : If we can get t he channel asynchronous or t he
[ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : t he closer t
fe016 [ s] : t hat would be very int erest ing for us
fe016 [ s^ df.%−] : because we [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ %−] : So if [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ fg|s^ df] : Yeah , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s why I only used t he
part from use
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : which we had uh about uh about t he alt over all t he
channels
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ %−] : That ’s [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ bk] : Yeah sure .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bsc] : or m ixed channel
m e013 [ s^ e] : rat her m ixed signal .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s.%−] : So if t here was a segm ent of speech t his long
fe016 [ %−] : cuz [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ 2:s] : And som eone said " oh " in t he front [ disfm arker] in
t he m iddle .
m e018 [ s^ bu^ na:s] : and oh and som eone said " oh , " t he whole
t hing was passed t o t he recognizer ?
m n014 [ s] : There were several speakers in it ,
m n014 [ b] : yeah .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : That ’s right . In fact I [ disfm arker] I pulled out a
couple classic exam ples in case you wanna u use t hem in your t alk of
m e001 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : That ’s why t here ’s so m any insert ion errors ?
fe016 [ s] : Chuck on t he lapel ,
fe016 [ s] : so Chuck wore t he lapel t hree out of four t im es .
m e001 [ b] : Mm m .
m e011 [ s^ na] : I not iced t hat Chuck was wearing t he lapel a lot .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Um , yeah ,
m e018 [ s^ aap|s^ aa] : Early on , yeah .
fe016 [ s] : and I wore t he lapel once ,
fe016 [ s] : and for m e t he lapel was OK .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : I m ean I st ill [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ no] : and I don’t know why .
fe016 [ %−−] : I ’m [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fh] : But um ,
fe016 [ s.%−] : for you it was [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ am ] : Probably how you wear it [ disfm arker] wore it I would
guess .
fe016 [ s] : Or who was next t o m e or som et hing like t hat .
m e001 [ fg|s^ na] : Yeah , where y ou were sit t ing probably affect ed it .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : Right , but when Chuck wore t he lapel and Morgan
was t alking t here ’re a couple really long ut t erances

fe016 [ s^ e] : where Chuck is saying a few t hings inside ,
fe016 [ s] : and it ’s picking up all of Morgan ’s words pret t y well
fe016 [ s.%−−] : and so t he rec you know , t here ’re error rat es
fe016 [ s.%−−] : because of insert ion [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : Insert ions aren’t bounded ,
fe016 [ s] : so wit h a one − word ut t erance and t en insert ions you know
y ou got huge error rat e .
m e011 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : And t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s where t he problem s com e in
.
fe016 [ s^ bd] : So I t his is sort of what we expect ed ,
fe016 [ s^ df] : but it ’s nice t o be able t o [ disfm arker] t o show it .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ t c] : And also I just want ed t o m ent ion briefly t hat , um , uh
Andreas and I called up Dan Ellis who ’s st ill st uck in Swit zerland ,
fe016 [ s] : and we were gonna ask him if [ disfm arker] if t here ’re
[ disfm arker] you know , what ’s out t here in t erm s of echo cancellat ion
and t hings like t hat .
fe016 [ s] : Not t hat we were gonna do it ,
fe016 [ s] : but we want ed t o know what would need t o be done .
m e011 [ s:s] : And he said , " Lot s lot s lot s lot s . "
fe016 [ fh|s] : And he [ disfm arker] We ’v e given him t he dat a we have
so far ,
fe016 [ s] : so t hese sychronous cases where t here are overlap .
m n014 [ b] : Yep .
fe016 [ s] : And he ’s gonna look int o t rying t o run som e t hings t hat are
out t here
fe016 [ s] : and see how well it can do
fe016 [ s^ df] : because right now we ’re not able t o act ually report on
recognit ion in a real paper ,
m e018 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ e] : like a Eurospeech paper ,
fe016 [ s^ df] : because it would look sort of prem at ure .
m e018 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu] : So t he idea is t hat you would t ake t his big hunk where
som ebody ’s only speaking a sm all am ount in it ,
m e018 [ s^ bu^ e.%−] : and t hen t ry t o figure out where t hey ’re
speaking [ com m ent ] based on t he ot her peopl
fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : Right . Or who ’s [ disfm arker] At any point in t im e who
’s t he foreground speaker ,
fe016 [ s^ e] : who ’s t he background speaker .
m e018 [ s] : I t hought we were just gonna m ove t he boundaries in .
m n014 [ %−] : So yeah [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fh] : So .
m n014 [ s^ aa|qy .%−] : Yeah , should it [ disfm arker]

m e011 [ s^ aap] : Well t hat ’s wit h t he hand st uff .
fe016 [ s.%−] : So t here ’s like [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qh^ df] : But how would y ou do t hat aut om at ically ?
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n014 [ s] : Uh , I ’ve act ually done som e experim ent s wit h cross −
correlat ion
fe016 [ %−] : Well t her t here ’s [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s] : and it seem s t o work pret t y well t o [ disfm arker] t o get rid
of t hose [ disfm arker] t hose overlaps ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean t hat t hat ’s t he sort of t hing t hat you would do .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s.%−] : Yeah . Exact ly , so it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s a
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m n014 [ b] : yeah .
m e018 [ qw] : So why do you want t o do echo cancellat ion ?
fe016 [ s] : Um , it would be t echniques used from adapt ive
[ disfm arker] adapt iv e echo cancellat ion
fe016 [ s^ bd^ no] : which I don’t know enough about t o t alk about .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : It [ disfm arker] just [ disfm arker] it just t o r t o rem ove cross
− t alk .
fe016 [ fh] : Um .
fe016 [ fg] : But ,
m e001 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : right , um , and t hat would be sim ilar t o what you ’re
also t rying t o do ,
fe016 [ s] : but using um , you know , m ore t han energy [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know what exact ly would go int o it .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , sure .
fe016 [ s] : So t he idea is t o basically run t his on t he whole m eet ing .
m e018 [ s^ bu.%−] : So it would be [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−] : and get t he locat ions , which gives you also t he t im e
boundaries of t he individual speak
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s] : So do sort of what he ’s already [ disfm arker] what he ’s
t ry ing t o do .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : Right . Except t hat t here are m any t echniques for t he
kinds of cues , um , t hat you can use t o do t hat .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK , I s I see .
m n014 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , in anot her way ,
m n014 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .

m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah , Dave [ disfm arker] Dave uh is , um , also gonna
be doin usin play ing around wit h echo cancellat ion for t he nearfield
farfield st uff ,
fe016 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s.%−] : so we ’ll be [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : And I guess Espen ?
fe016 [ qy ] : This [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] is he here
t oo ?
fe016 [ s.%−−] : May also be working [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−] : So it would just be v er
fe016 [ s] : t hat ’s really t he nex t st ep
fe016 [ s^ df] : because we can’t do t oo m uch , you know , on t erm in
t erm s of recognit ion result s knowing t hat t his is a big problem
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ e] : um , unt il we can do t hat kind of processing .
fe016 [ s] : And so , once we hav e som e [ disfm arker] som e of yours ,
m n014 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n014 [ s^ bk|s^ cc] : Yeah I ’m working on it .
fe016 [ s] : and @ @ we ’ll m ove on .
m e018 [ s] : I t hink t his also t ies int o one of t he t hings t hat Jane is
gonna t alk about t oo .
m e011 [ fg] : Um ,
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m . Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : I also want ed t o say I have done all t his chopping up of
digit s ,
m e011 [ s] : so I hav e som e nam ing convent ions t hat we should t ry t o
agree on .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Oh right .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : So let ’s do t hat off − line ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : we don’t need t o do it during t he m eet ing .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : Definit ely [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−] : Uh , and Don should [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and I have script s t hat will ext ract it out
from " key " files
m e011 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and do all t he nam ing aut om at ically ,
fe016 [ b] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : so you don’t have t o do it by hand .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : Alright .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : Great .

fe016 [ s.%−] : So t hat t hat ’s it for t he [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s^ bu] : You ’ve com piled t he list of , uh , speaker nam es ?
fe016 [ s^ 2.%−] : Speakers and [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e001 [ s^ bsc] : Not nam es ,
m e001 [ s^ bsc] : but I Ds .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e011 [ s^ na] : Yeah , nam es [ disfm arker] nam es in t he [ disfm arker]
nam es t o I Ds ,
m e011 [ %−] : so y ou
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : Great .
m e011 [ s] : and it does all sort s of m at ches
m e011 [ s^ df] : because t he way people filled out nam es is different on
ev ery single file
m e011 [ s] : so it does a very fuzzy sort of m at ch .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e001 [ s^ ba] : Cool .
fe016 [ s] : So at t his point we can sort of finalize t he nam ing , and so
fort h ,
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
fe016 [ s] : and we ’re gonna basically re rewrit e out t hese waveform s
t hat we did
m e001 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ df] : because as you not ice in t he paper your " M O
fe016 [ s] : in one m eet ing
fe016 [ s.%−] : and " M O − t wo " in anot her m eet ing and it ’s
[ disfm arker] we just need t o st andardize t he
m e001 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e001 [ s^ df] : That was m y fault .
fe016 [ fh] : um ,
fe016 [ s^ ar^ bd|%−] : no it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : No , I didn’t not ice t hat act ually .
fe016 [ s] : um , t hat ’s why t hose com m ent s are s [ vocalsound] are in
t here .
m e013 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e001 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e001 [ s^ co^ j] : Then disregard it t hen .
m e011 [ s:s] : So t h I now have a script t hat you can just say basically
look up Morgan ,
fe016 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : OK .

m e011 [ s^ e] : and it will give you his ID .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : Great , great .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : Terrific .
m e011 [ fh] : Um ,
m e011 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : alright .
m e011 [ qy.%−−] : Do we [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : Don , y ou had disk space and st orage
form at s .
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t hat som et hing we need t o t alk about at t he
m eet ing ,
m e011 [ qrr] : or should you just t alk wit h Chuck at som e ot her t im e ?
m e001 [ h|s] : Um , I had som e general quest ions just about t he
com pression algorit hm s of short ening wav eform s
m e001 [ s^ e^ no] : and I don’t know exact ly who t o ask .
m e001 [ s^ df] : I t hought t hat m ay be y ou would be t he [ disfm arker] t he
person t o t alk t o .
m e001 [ qy .%−−] : So , is it a lossless com pression [ com m ent ] when you
com press ,
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e001 [ %−−] : so [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Ent ropy coding .
m e001 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : It just uses ent ropy coding ?
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e001 [ s.%−−] : So , I m ean , I guess m y quest ion would be is
m e001 [ s] : I just got t his new eight een gig drive inst alled .
m e001 [ fh] : Um , yeah ,
m e001 [ %−] : which is [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.%−] : And I assum e half of it is scrat ch and half of it is
[ disfm arker] ?
m e001 [ s^ no] : I ’m not exact ly sure how t hey part it ioned it .
m e011 [ s^ am |s^ bk] : Probably , yeah .
m e001 [ fh] : But um ,
m e013 [ s^ ba] : That ’s t ypical , huh .
m e001 [ s^ bk|s^ no] : yeah , I don’t know what ’s t ypical here ,
m e001 [ fh] : but um ,
m e001 [ s] : it ’s local t hough ,
m e001 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bd] : That doesn’t m at t er .
m e001 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : You can access it from anywhere in ICSI . N [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ qr.%−] : In fact , t his is an eight een gig drive , [ com m ent ] or is
it a t hirt y six gig driv e wit h eight een [ disfm arker]

m e001 [ s^ bk] : Alright .
m e001 [ qw^ rt ] : How do you do t hat ?
m e011 [ %−] : N [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s] : Eight een .
fe016 [ s] : Eigh − eight een .
fe016 [ s] : It was a spare t hat Dave had around [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh OK .
m e011 [ s] : Slash N slash m achine nam e , slash X A in all likelihood .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : Oh I see .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e001 [ s^ bk|s^ df^ no] : Alright , I did know t hat .
m e011 [ fg|qh.%−−] : Um , so t he [ disfm arker] t he only quest ion is how
m uch of it [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : The dist inct ion bet ween scrat ch and non − scrat ch is
whet her it ’s backed up or not .
m e001 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e001 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : So what you wanna do is use t he scrat ch for st uff t hat you
can regenerat e .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ fh] : So ,
m e011 [ s] : t he st uff t hat isn’t backed up is not a big deal
m e011 [ s] : because disks don’t crash very frequent ly ,
m e001 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ e] : as long as you can regenerat e it .
m e001 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ %−] : Yeah it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s] : I m ean all of t his st uff can be regenerat ed ,
m e001 [ s.%−] : it ’s just a quest ion [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ %−] : Well t he [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ cs] : Then put it all on scrat ch
m e011 [ s^ df] : because we ’re [ disfm arker] ICSI is [ disfm arker] is
bot t lenecked by backup .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Mm − hm m , very good point .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s^ aap] : Well I ’d leave all t he [ disfm arker] All t he t ranscript
st uff shouldn’t [ disfm arker] should be backed up ,
m e011 [ s.%−] : So we wanna put [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : but all t he waveform [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] Sound files
should not be backed up ,
m e001 [ fg|%−] : Yeah , I guess [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ e] : t he ones t hat you writ e out .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m e001 [ qh] : So , I m ean , I guess t h t he ot her quest ion was t hen ,
should we short en t hem , downsam ple t hem , or keep t hem in t heir
original form ?
m e001 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : It just depends on y our t ools .
m e011 [ s^ df] : I m ean , because it ’s not backed up and it ’s just on
scrat ch , if y our sc t ools can’t t ake short ened form at , I would leave
t hem ex panded ,
m e001 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : so y ou don’t have t o unshort en t hem every single t im e you
wanna do any t hing .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s] : We can downsam ple t hem ,
m e001 [ qy ] : Do you t hink t hat ’d be OK ?
fe016 [ fh] : so .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e001 [ s^ e] : To downsam ple t hem ?
fe016 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , we get t he sam e perform ance .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s^ df] : I m ean t he r t he front − end on t he SRI recognizer just
downsam ples t hem on t he fly ,
m e001 [ fg|s] : Yeah , I guess t he only argum ent against downsam pling
is t o preserve just t he original files in case we want t o experim ent wit h
different filt ering t echniques .
fe016 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ %−] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I ’m sorry [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bk|%−] : Yeah , if
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , l I m ean over all our dat a , we [ disfm arker]
we want t o not downsam ple .
fe016 [ %−] : fe
fe016 [ s.%−−] : You ’d [ disfm arker] you wanna not .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : So we ’re [ disfm arker] what we ’re doing is we ’re writ ing
out [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ bd^ df] : I m ean , t his is just a quest ion .
fe016 [ s] : We ’re writ ing out t hese individual segm ent s , t hat wherever
t here ’s a t im e boundary from Thilo , or [ disfm arker] or Jane ’s
t ranscribers , you know , we [ disfm arker] we chop it [ pause] t here .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : And t he reason is so t hat we can feed it t o t he recognizer ,
m e013 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ e] : and t hrow out ones t hat we ’re not using and so fort h .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .

fe016 [ s] : And t hose are t he ones t hat we ’re st oring .
m e011 [ fg|s^ cs] : Yeah , as I said , since t hat ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
regenerat able , what I would do is t ake [ disfm arker] downsam ple it ,
fe016 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ cs^ e] : and com press it however you ’re e t he SRI
recognizer want s t o t ake it in .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : So we can’t short en t hem ,
m e013 [ fg.%] : y e
fe016 [ s^ e] : but we can downsam ple t hem .
m e001 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ fg|%−−] : Yeah , I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s^ fa] : y eah , I ’m sorry .
fe016 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s.%−] : As [ disfm arker] yeah , as long as t here is a [ disfm arker]
a form t hat we can com e from again , t hat is not downsam pled ,
[ com m ent ] t hen ,
m e001 [ %−] : r
m e001 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ aa|%−] : Oh yeah t h
m e001 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah t hose are gonna be kept .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : That [ disfm arker] t hat ’s why we need m ore disk space
m e013 [ fh] : uuu
fe016 [ s.%−] : cuz we ’re basically duplicat ing t he originals , um
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : Then it ’s fine .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : But for [ disfm arker] for [ disfm arker] fu fut ure research we
’ll be doing it wit h different m icrophone posit ions and so on
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Oh yeah .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : No . We always have t he original long ones .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e001 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−] : we would like t o [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So t he SRI front − end won’t t ake a uh
[ disfm arker] an [ disfm arker] an [ disfm arker] a large audio file nam e
and t hen a [ disfm arker] a list of segm ent s t o chop out [ com m ent ] from
t hat large audio file ?
m e018 [ s^ e^ rt ] : They act ually have t o be chopped out already ?
fe016 [ s] : Um , it ’s bet t er if t hey ’re chopped out ,
fe016 [ s.%−−] : and [ disfm arker] and it [ disfm arker] it will be
[ disfm arker]

m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : y eah , y we could probably writ e som et hing t o do t hat ,
fe016 [ s] : but it ’s act ually convenient t o have t hem chopped out
fe016 [ s] : cuz you can run t hem , you know , in different orders .
fe016 [ s] : You c y ou can act ually m ov e t hem around .
m e011 [ s] : And t hat ’s t he whole point about t he nam ing convent ions
fe016 [ s.%−] : Uh , y ou can get rid of
m e011 [ s] : is t hat you could run all t he English speaking ,
fe016 [ s^ aa|s^ ba] : Yeah , it it ’s a lot fast er .
m e011 [ s^ e] : all t he nat ive speakers ,
fe016 [ s^ aa|s^ na:s] : Right . You can grab everyt hing wit h t he word "
t he " in it ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : and all t he non − nat ive speakers ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : and all t he m en , and all t he wom en .
fe016 [ %−] : and it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : That ’s a lot quicker t han act ually t rying t o access t he
wav efile each t im e ,
fe016 [ s^ e.%−−] : find t he t im e boundaries and [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : So in principle , yeah , you could do t hat ,
m e018 [ s^ nd] : I don’t [ disfm arker] I don’t t hink t hat ’s really right .
fe016 [ %−] : but it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : but it ’s um [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ j^ m ] : " That ’s just not right , m an . "
fe016 [ s^ df.%−−] : These are long [ disfm arker] These are long
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.%−] : The [ disfm arker] t he point [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qh^ df] : So [ disfm arker] so s For exam ple , what if you want ed
t o run [ disfm arker] run all t he nat iv e speakers .
fe016 [ fh] : You know .
fe016 [ s^ df] : This is an hour of speech .
m e011 [ s^ f|s] : Right , so if [ disfm arker] if you did it t hat way you would
have t o generat e a program t hat looks in t he dat abase som ewhere ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : ex t ract s out t he language ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : finds t he t im e − m arks for t hat part icular one ,
m e011 [ s] : do it t hat way .
m e011 [ s] : The way t hey ’re doing it , you have t hat already ext ract ed
m e011 [ s] : and it ’s em bedded in t he file nam e .
m e011 [ s.%−] : And so , you know , you just say [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fg|s] : We − yeah t hat ’s [ disfm arker] so t hat ’s part of it
m e011 [ s:s] : y so you just say you know " ast erisk E ast erisk dot wave
" , and you get what you want .
fe016 [ %−] : is [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s] : And t he ot her part is just t hat once t hey ’re writ t en out it
[ disfm arker] it is a lot fast er t o [ disfm arker] t o process t hem .

m e011 [ s^ 2] : Rat her t han doing seeks t hrough t he file .
fe016 [ fh] : So .
fe016 [ s.%−] : Ot herwise , you ’re just accessing [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ df] : This is all just t em porary access ,
m e011 [ s.%−−] : so I don’t [ disfm arker] I t hink [ disfm arker] it ’s all just
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ba] : It ’s fine .
m e011 [ s^ f] : You know .
m e011 [ s] : Fine t o do it however is convenient .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean it just depends how big t he file is .
m e013 [ s] : If t he file sit s in m em ory you can do ext rem ely fast seeks
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : The ot her t hing is t hat , believe it or not [ disfm arker] I
m ean , we have som e [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : but .
m e011 [ s^ aa^ t 3|s^ t 3] : Yeah and t hey don’t .
m e011 [ s^ rt ^ t 3] : Two gig ?
fe016 [ s] : So we ’re also looking at t hese in Waves like for t he
alignm ent s and so fort h .
fe016 [ s] : You can’t load an hour of speech int o X Waves .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : You need t o s have t hese sm all files ,
fe016 [ s.%−] : and in fact , even for t he Transcriber program Um
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ nd] : Yes you can .
m e018 [ fg|s^ df^ ng] : Yeah , you [ disfm arker] you can give Waves a
st art and an end t im e .
fe016 [ s^ df.%−] : Yeah , if you t ry t o load s really long waveform int o X
Wav es , y ou ’ll be wait ing t here for [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ e] : And m iddle .
m e018 [ s^ ar|s^ df] : No , I [ disfm arker] I ’m not suggest ing you load a
long wav e file ,
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Oh
m e018 [ s] : I ’m just saying you give it a st art and an end t im e .
m e018 [ s] : And it ’ll just go and pull out t hat sect ion .
m e011 [ %−] : I t h
m e011 [ s^ bu] : w The t ranscribers didn’t have any problem wit h t hat
m e011 [ qy ] : did t hey Jane ?
fe008 [ qw^ rt ] : What ’s t h u w in what respect ?
fe016 [ s.%−] : Loading t he long [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : They loaded [ disfm arker] t hey loaded t he long long files
int o X Waves .
m n014 [ s^ ar|s] : No , wit h t he Transcriber t ool , it ’s no problem .
fe016 [ s.%−] : It t akes a very long t i
fe008 [ %−] : In t he [ disfm arker] in

m n014 [ s] : Yeah just t o load a t ranscript ion
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ na] : It t akes a l very long t im e .
m n014 [ s] : t akes a long t im e ,
m n014 [ s] : but not for t he wav efile .
m n014 [ s] : The wavefile is t here im m ediat ely .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m . Yeah .
m e011 [ qr] : Are y ou t alking about Transcriber or X Waves ?
fe016 [ b.%] : Huh .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s] : Oh , I ’m t r t alking about Transcriber .
fe016 [ s^ nd|qy ^ d^ g] : Act ually , y ou ’re t alking about Transcriber ,
right ?
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : It was also t rue of t he digit s t ask which was X Waves .
m e011 [ s^ df] : Because [ disfm arker] because i we used X Waves t o do
t he digit s .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : And t hey were loading t he full m ixed files t hen ,
fe008 [ s^ 2] : Very quickly .
m e011 [ s] : and it didn’t seem t o be any problem .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : I agree .
fe016 [ b] : Huh .
fe016 [ s^ nd] : Well we [ disfm arker] we have a problem wit h t hat ,
fe016 [ s^ df.%−−] : y ou know , t im e − wise on a [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : It − it ’s a lot slower t o load in a long file ,
m e011 [ b] : Hm m .
m e011 [ s^ ba^ nd] : Seem ed really fast .
fe016 [ s^ e^ rt ] : and also t o check t he file ,
fe016 [ s.%−] : so if you have a t ranscript , um ,
m e011 [ s.%−] : Well regardless , it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−] : I m ean it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink overall you could get everyt hing t o work
by accessing t he sam e waveform and t ry ing t o find t wo [ disfm arker]
y ou know , t he begin and end t im es .
fe016 [ fh] : Um ,
fe016 [ s^ cs^ df] : but I t hink it ’s m ore efficient , if we have t he st orage
space , t o hav e t he sm all ones .
m e011 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g] : and , it ’s no problem , right ?
fe016 [ %−] : Yeah , it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ df] : Because it ’s not backed up .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ %−] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s just [ disfm arker]

m e011 [ s.%−−] : So we just [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : If we don’t have a spare disk sit t ing around we go out and
we buy ourselves an eight y gigaby t e drive
m e011 [ s^ e] : and m ake it all scrat ch space .
m e011 [ s] : You know , it ’s not a big deal .
fe008 [ s] : You ’re right about t he backup being [ pause] a bot t leneck .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : It ’s good t o t hink t owards scrat ch .
fe016 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , so t hese wouldn’t be backed up , t he
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yep .

m e011 [ s^ co^ t ^ t c] : So rem ind m e aft erward

m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK . Alright .
m e001 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g] : I m ean , I could just u do a DU on it right ?
m e001 [ s^ e] : And just see which [ disfm arker] how m uch is on each

m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e001 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Each part it ion .
m e011 [ s] : And y ou wanna use , eit her XA or scrat ch .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ bsc] : Well X quest ion m ark ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : any t hing st art ing wit h X is scrat ch .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ 2] : Wit h t wo [ disfm arker] t wo digit s .
m e011 [ s^ m |s^ aa] : Two digit s , right ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : XA , XB , XC .
m e013 [ fh] : So , @ @ .
m e011 [ qy^ f^ rt ] : OK ?
m e011 [ qo^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : Jane ?
fe008 [ s^ bk|s] : OK . So I got a lit t le print − out here .
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : So t hree on t his side ,
fe008 [ s] : t hree on t his side .
fe008 [ s] : And I st apled t hem .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ fg|s] : Alright so , first of all , um , t here was a [ disfm arker] an
int erest in t he t ranscribe t ranscript ion , uh , checking procedures
fe008 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] and I can [ vocalsound] t ell
y ou first , uh , t o go t hrough t he st eps
fe008 [ s] : alt hough y ou ’ve probably seen t hem .

fe008 [ s.%−−] : Um , as you m ight im agine , when you ’re dealing wit h ,
um , r really c a fair num ber of words , and uh , @ @ [ com m ent ]
nat ural speech
fe008 [ s] : which m eans s self − repairs and all t hese ot her fact ors ,
t hat t here ’re lot s of t hings t o be , um , s st andardized and
st ream lined and checked on .
fe008 [ fh] : And , um , so ,
fe008 [ s] : I did a bunch of checks ,
fe008 [ s] : and t he first t hing I did was obv iously a spell − check .
fe008 [ s] : And at t hat point I discovered cert ain t hings
fe008 [ s:s] : like , um , " accom m odat e " wit h one " M " ,
fe008 [ s] : t hat kind of t hing .
fe008 [ s] : And t hen , in addit ion t o t hat , I did an exhaust ive list ing of
t he form s in t he dat a file ,
fe008 [ s] : which included n det ect ing t hings like f fault y punct uat ion
and t hings [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ fa] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m sorry t o int errupt
fe008 [ qw^ br] : Yeah ?
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : y ou could [ disfm arker] could I just back up a lit t le bit
fe008 [ s^ aa|s^ co] : Sure , please ,
fe008 [ s^ aa|s^ co^ r] : yeah , please , please .
m e018 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : So y ou ’re doing t hese [ disfm arker] So [ pause] t he
whole process is t hat t he t ranscribers get t he conversat ion
m e018 [ s^ bu^ e] : and t hey do t heir pass over it .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m e018 [ s] : And t hen when t hey ’re finished wit h it , it com es t o you ,
m e018 [ s] : and y ou begin t hese sanit t hese qualit y checks .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Ex act ly .
fe008 [ s^ 2^ na] : I do t hese checks .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Ex act ly .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ft ] : Thank y ou .
fe008 [ s^ rt .%−−] : And so , uh , I do a [ disfm arker] an exhaust ive list ing
of t he form s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : Act ually , I will go t hrough t his in [ disfm arker] in order ,
fe008 [ s^ cs] : so if [ disfm arker] if we could m aybe wait and st ick keep
t hat for a second
fe008 [ s^ df] : cuz we ’re not ready for t hat .
m e011 [ s^ j.%−−] : So on t he fift h page , seven down [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Exact ly ! Exact ly !

fe008 [ fg|s] : Alright so , [ vocalsound] a spelling check first
fe008 [ s] : t hen an exhaust ive list ing of t he , uh [ disfm arker] all t he
form s in t he dat a wit h t he punct uat ion at t ached
fe008 [ s] : and at t hat point I pick up t hings like , oh , you know , word
followed by t wo com m as .
fe008 [ s] : And t h and t hen anot her check involves , uh , being sure
t hat ev ery ut t erance has an ident ifiable speaker .
fe008 [ s] : And if not , t hen t hat get s checked .
fe008 [ s] : Then t here ’s t his issue of glossing s w so − called " spoken −
form s " .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So t here [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : m o for t he m ost part , we ’re keeping it st andard wo word
lev el t ranscript ion .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : But t here ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : w And t hat t hat ’s done wit h t he assum pt ion t hat [ pause]
pronunciat ion v ariant s can be handled .
fe008 [ s:s] : So for t hings like " and " , t he fact t hat som eone doesn’t
say t he " D " , uh t hat ’s not im port ant enough t o capt ure in t he
t ranscript ion
fe008 [ s^ df] : because a [ disfm arker] a good pronunciat ion , uh , you
know , m odel would be able t o handle t hat .
fe008 [ s:s] : Howev er , t hings like " cuz " where you ’re lacking an
ent ire v ery prom inent first syllable ,
fe008 [ s] : and furt herm ore , it ’s a form t hat ’s specific t o spoken
language ,
fe008 [ s] : t hose are r reasons [ disfm arker] f for t hose reasons I
[ disfm arker] I kept t hat separat e ,
fe008 [ s:s] : and used t he convent ion of using " CUZ " for t hat form ,
fe008 [ s] : howev er , glossing it
fe008 [ s^ df] : so t hat it ’s possible wit h t he script t o plug in t he full
ort hographic form for t hat one ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : and a couple of ot hers ,
fe008 [ s^ bd] : not m any .
fe008 [ s:s] : So " wanna " is anot her one ,
fe008 [ s:s] : " going [ disfm arker] " uh , " gonna " is anot her one ,
fe008 [ s] : wit h just t he assum pt ion , again , t hat t his [ disfm arker] t h
t hese are t hings which it ’s not really fair t o a c consider [ disfm arker]
ex pect t hat [ disfm arker] a pronunciat ion m odel , t o handle .
fe008 [ s^ bu|qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : And Chuck , you in you indicat ed t hat " cuz "
is [ disfm arker] is one of t hose t hat ’s handled in a different way also ,
didn’t y ou ?
fe008 [ qy .%−−] : Did I [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ no] : I don’t rem em ber .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so it m ight not have been [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] It m ight not have been you ,

m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s] : but som eone t old m e t hat in fact " cuz " is t reat ed
different ly in , um , i u in t his cont ext
fe008 [ s^ df] : because of t hat r reason t hat , um , it ’s a lit t le bit
fart her t han a pronunciat ion variant .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : OK , so aft er t hat ,
fe008 [ s^ t 1] : let ’s see ,
fe008 [ fh] : um .
m e018 [ qr] : So t hat was part of t he spell − check , [ com m ent ] or was
t hat [ disfm arker] t hat was aft er t he spell − check ?
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well so when I get t he exhau
fe008 [ s] : So t he spell − check picks up t hose words
fe008 [ s^ df] : because t hey ’re not in t he dict ionary .
m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe008 [ s.%−:s.%−] : So it get s " cuz " and " wanna " and t hat
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : And t hen you gloss t hem ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , m m − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ na.%−−] : Run it t hrough [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ df:s] : I have a sed [ disfm arker] You know , so I do sed script
say ing whenev er y ou see " gonna " you know , " convert it t o gonna " ,
y ou know , " gloss equals quot e going − t o quot e " ,
fe008 [ s^ f] : y ou know .
fe008 [ s] : And wit h all t hese t hings being in curly bracket s
fe008 [ s^ df] : so t hey ’re always dist inct iv e .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ fg|s] : OK , I also wrot e a script which will , um , ret rieve anyt hing
in curly bracket s , [ v ocalsound] or anyt hing which I ’ve classified as an
acronym ,
fe008 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] a pronounced acronym .
fe008 [ s] : And t he way I t ag ac pronounced acronym s is t hat I have
underscores bet ween t he com ponent s .
fe008 [ s:s] : So if it ’s " ACL " t hen it ’s " A " underscore " C "
underscore " L " .
fe008 [ s.%−] : And t he t h
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : And so [ disfm arker] so y our list here , are t hese ones
t hat act ually occurred in t he m eet ings ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes . Uh − huh , yeah .
m e011 [ s^ ba^ fe] : Whew !
fe008 [ fg|%−] : OK , so now . Uh and [ disfm arker] a
m e011 [ s^ ba] : We are acronym − loaded .
fe016 [ qy ] : Um , can I ask a quest ion about t he glossing , uh before
we go on ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ qy ^ rt ] : So , for a word like " because " is it t hat it ’s always
predict ably " because " ?

fe016 [ qy ^ e^ rt ] : I m ean , is " CUZ " always m eaning " because " ?
fe008 [ s^ aa|s^ nd] : Yes , but not t he reverse .
fe008 [ s^ df] : So som et im es people will say " because " in t he m eet ing
,
fe008 [ s^ df.%−−:s] : and if [ disfm arker] if t hey act ually said " because "
, t hen it ’s writ t en as " because " wit h no [ disfm arker] w
fe008 [ s^ df:s] : " cuz " doesn’t even figure int o t he equat ion .
fe016 [ %−] : Beca − because [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ j:qw] : But [ disfm arker] but in our m eet ings people don’t say
" hey cuz how y ou doing ? "
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right . [ com m ent ] [ vocalsound] Right .
m e011 [ s^ ng] : Except right t here .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : Um , so , I guess [ disfm arker] So , from t he point of view
of [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s a good point .
fe016 [ s:s] : The [ disfm arker] t he only problem is t hat wit h [ disfm arker]
for t he recognit ion we [ disfm arker] we m ap it t o " because " ,
fe016 [ s.%−:s] : and so if we know t hat " CUZ " [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ %−] : Well ,
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s fine .
fe008 [ s^ bd] : Well Don has a script .
m e011 [ s] : but t hey have t he gloss .
m e001 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−] : but , we don’t [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ r] : You have t he gloss form
m e011 [ s^ e] : so you always replace it .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Ex act ly .
m e011 [ s^ e] : If t hat ’s how [ disfm arker] what you wanna do .
fe008 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe008 [ s] : And Don knows t his ,
fe008 [ s.%−] : and he ’s bee he has a glo he has a script t hat
[ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e001 [ s^ na] : I replace t he " cuz " wit h " because " if it ’s glossed .
fe016 [ %−] : S
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : But , if it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g] : But t hen t here are ot her glosses t hat we don’t
replace , right ?
m e001 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ %−] : Because [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yes . And t hat ’s why t here ’re different t ags on
t he glosses ,

fe016 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : OK . So , t hen it ’s fine .
fe008 [ s^ e] : on t he different [ disfm arker] on t he different t ypes of
com m ent s ,
fe008 [ s] : which we ’ll [ disfm arker] which we ’ll see in just a second .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : So t he pronounceable acronym s get underscores ,
fe008 [ s] : t he t hings in curly bracket s are viewed as com m ent s .
fe008 [ s] : There ’re com m ent s of four t y pes .
fe008 [ s] : So t his is a good t im e t o int roduce t hat .
fe008 [ s] : The four t ypes .
fe008 [ s] : w And m ay be we ’ll ex pand t hat
m e011 [ %−] : Um [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : but t he [ disfm arker] but t he com m ent s are , um , of four
t y pes m ainly right now .
fe008 [ s] : One of t hem is , um , t he gloss t ype we just m ent ioned .
m e011 [ %−] : Can [ disfm arker] ca
fe008 [ s.%−] : Anot her t ype is , um [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg|qy ] : So a are we done wit h acronym s ?
m e011 [ s^ df] : Cuz I had a quest ion on what [ disfm arker] what t his
m eant .
fe008 [ s] : I ’m st ill doing t he overview .
fe008 [ s] : I haven’t act ually got t en here yet .
m e011 [ s^ fa] : Oh I ’m sorry .
fe008 [ fg|s] : OK so , gloss is t hings like replacing t he full form u wit h
t he , um , m ore abbreviat ed one t o t he left .
fe008 [ s] : Uh , t hen you have if it ’s [ disfm arker] uh , t here ’re a
couple different t y pes of elem ent s t hat can happen t hat aren’t really
properly words ,
fe008 [ s] : and wo som e of t hem are laughs and breat hes ,
fe008 [ s^ rt :s^ rt ] : so we have [ disfm arker] uh t hat ’s prepended wit h
a v a t ag of " VOC " .
m n014 [ s^ ba] : Whew !
m n014 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
fe008 [ s] : And t he non − vocal ones are like door − slam s and t appings
,
fe008 [ s] : and t hat ’s prepended wit h a no non − vocalizat ion .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So t hen it [ disfm arker] just an ending curly
brace t here ,
m e018 [ qrr] : or is t here som et hing else in t here .
fe008 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : Oh yeah , so i e t his would [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : Let ’s just t ake one exam ple .
m e011 [ s] : A com m ent , basically .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , oh , oh .
fe008 [ s] : And t hen t he no non − vocalizat ion would be som et hing like
a door − slam .

fe008 [ s] : They always end .
fe008 [ s] : So it ’s like t hey ’re paired curly bracket s .
fe008 [ s] : And t hen t he t hird t y pe right now , [ vocalsound] uh , is
[ pause] m t hings t hat fall in t he cat egory of com m ent s about what ’s
happening .
fe008 [ s] : So it could be som et hing like , y ou know , " referring t o so −
and − so " ,
fe008 [ s] : " t alking about such − and − such " ,
fe008 [ s] : uh , y ou know , " looking at so − and − so " .
m e018 [ s.%−] : So on t he m
m e018 [ s^ bu] : on t he m iddle t So , in t he first case t hat gloss applies
t o t he word t o t he left .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , and t his get s subst it ut ed here .
m e018 [ s^ bu^ e|qy ^ d^ g] : But in t he m iddle t wo [ disfm arker] Th − it ’s
not apply ing t o any t hing , right ?
m e011 [ s] : They ’re im pulsive .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Huh − uh .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : No , t hey ’re ev ent s .
fe008 [ s^ e] : They ’re act ually [ disfm arker] They have t he st at us of
ev ent s .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : Well t he " QUAL " can be [ disfm arker] The " QUAL " is
apply ing t o t he left .
m e018 [ s^ bk|s] : Right , I just m eant t he m iddle t wo ones ,
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : yeah .
fe008 [ s] : Well , and act ually , um , it is t rue t hat , wit h respect t o "
laugh " , t here ’s anot her one
fe008 [ s^ e] : which is " while laughing " ,
m e011 [ s^ 2] : " While laughing " .
fe008 [ s] : and t hat is , uh , i i An argum ent could be m ade for t his
[ disfm arker] t ur t urning t hat int o a qualit at ive st at em ent
fe008 [ s^ df] : because it ’s t alking about t he t hing t hat preceded it ,
fe008 [ s|s^ f] : but at present we hav en’t been , um , uh , coding t he
ex act scope of laughing , you know ,
fe008 [ s] : and so t o have " while laughing " , you know t hat it
happened som ewhere in t here
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : which could well m ean t hat it occurred separat ely and
following ,
fe008 [ s] : or , you know , including som e of t he ut t erances t o t he left .
fe008 [ s] : Hav en’t been awfully precise about t hat ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : but I have here ,
fe008 [ s] : now we ’re about t o get t o t he [ disfm arker] t o t his now ,
fe008 [ s] : I hav e frequencies .

fe008 [ s] : So y ou ’ll see how oft en t hese different t hings occur .
fe008 [ fh|s] : But , um , uh , t he v ery front page deals wit h t his , uh ,
final c pa uh , uh , aspect of t he st andardizat ion
fe008 [ s] : which has t o do wit h t he spoken form s like " m m − hm m "
and " m m − hm m " and " ha " and " uh − uh " and all t hese different
t y pes .
fe008 [ s] : And , um , uh , som eone point ed out t o m e ,
fe008 [ s] : t his m ight have been Chuck , [ com m ent ] about , um
[ disfm arker] about how a recognizer , if it ’s looking for " m m − hm m m "
wit h t hree M ’s , [ v ocalsound] and it ’s t ranscribed wit h t wo M ’s ,
[ v ocalsound] t hat it m ight [ disfm arker] uh , t hat it m ight increase t he

fe008 [ s] : which is [ disfm arker] which would really be a sham e
fe008 [ s^ df] : because um , I p I personally w would not be able t o
m ake a claim t hat t hose are dr dram at ically different it em s .
fe008 [ s] : So , right now I ’ve st andardized across all t he exist ing dat a
wit h t hese spoken form s .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Oh good .
fe008 [ s.%−] : I [ disfm arker] I should say

.
fe008 [ s.%−] : So , I ’m gonna [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] I ’m gonna
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] I ’m gonna check [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bu^ j^ rt ] : That [ disfm arker] t hat ’s known as " found dat a "
.
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Acsu − act ually yeah .

t hat has t o have a pronunciat ion of " t ickle " .

fe016 [ s^ fa] : Oh , sorry .

fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : Yeah so t h t h t here t here ’s a few cases like t hat where t he
um , t he word needs t o be spelled out in [ disfm arker] in a consist ent

fe016 [ s] : but t here ’s not very m any of t hese .
fe016 [ s] : Tcl ’s one of t hem .
m e011 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and y ou ’ll ha you ’ll have t o do it

fe016 [ s.%−−] : If we m ake a spelling correct ion t o t heir nam e ,
fe016 [ s] : like som eone had Deborah Tannen ’s nam e m ispelled ,
fe016 [ s] : and since we know who t hat is , you know , we could correct
it ,
m e011 [ s^ 2] : You can correct it .
fe016 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : but we need t o m ake sure we have t he m ispel
fe016 [ s] : If it doesn’t get correct ed we have t o have a pronunciat ion

fe016 [ s] : So if t here ’s t hings t hat get correct ed before we get t hem ,
it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not an issue ,
fe016 [ s] : but if t here ’s t hings t hat um , we change lat er , t hen we
always have t o keep our [ disfm arker] t he dict ionary up t o dat e .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s.%−−:s] : And t hen , yeah , in t he case of " t ickle " I guess we

m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : You add it t o t he dict ionary .
fe016 [ s] : which norm ally would be an acronym ,
fe016 [ s^ e:s] : y ou know , " TCL "
m e011 [ b] : Right .

m e011 [ s] : it seem s like t here are lot s of different ways it ’s being
done .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Int erest ing quest ion .
m e011 [ s.%−] : There ’s a [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yes .
fe008 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : OK , now first of all [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ fe] : Ooo − ooo !
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Very im port ant .
m e011 [ s^ m ] : " Ooo − ooo . "
fe008 [ s] : Uh Chuck [ disfm arker] Chuck led t o a refinem ent here
fe008 [ s] : which is t o add " NUMS " if t hese are part s of t he read
num bers .
fe008 [ s] : Now you already know i t hat I had , uh , in places where
t hey hadn’t t ranscribed num bers , I put " num bers " in place of any
kind of num bers ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : but t here are places where t hey ,

fe008 [ fh|s] : um , it [ disfm arker] t h t his convent ion cam e lat er
fe008 [ s] : an and at t he very first digit s t ask in som e t ranscript s t hey
act ually t ranscribed num bers .
fe008 [ fh] : And , um ,
fe008 [ %−−] : d
fe008 [ s] : Chuck point ed out t hat t his is read speech ,
fe008 [ s] : and it ’s nice t o have t he opt ion of ignoring it for cert ain
ot her prob uh p uh , t hings .
fe008 [ s] : And t hat ’s why t here ’s t his ot her t ag here which occurs a
hundred and five [ disfm arker] or t hree hundred and five t im es right
now
fe008 [ s] : which is just [ disfm arker] well n n " NUMS " by it self
m e011 [ s^ 2] : " NUMS " ,
m e011 [ b] : y eah .
fe008 [ s] : which m eans t his is part of t he num bers t ask .
fe008 [ s] : I m ay change it t o " digit s " .
fe008 [ s] : I m ean , i wit h t he sed com m and you can really just change
it however y ou want
fe008 [ s^ df|qy^ d^ f^ g] : because it ’s syst em at ically encoded , you
know ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
fe008 [ s] : Have t o t hink about what ’s t he best for [ disfm arker] for t he
ov erall purposes ,
fe008 [ s] : but in any case , um , " num bers " and " NUMS " are a part
of t his digit s t ask t hing .
fe008 [ s] : Um , now t h Then I hav e t hese num bers t hat have quot at ion
m arks around t hem .
fe008 [ s] : Um , I didn’t want t o put t hem in as gloss com m ent s
fe008 [ s] : because t hen you get t he subst it ut ion .
fe008 [ s] : And act ually , t h um , [ v ocalsound] t he reason I b did it t his
way was because I init ially st art ed out wit h t he ot her version ,
fe008 [ s] : you have t he num bers and you have t he full form and t he
parent heses ,
fe008 [ s] : howev er som et im es people st um ble over t hese num bers
t hey ’re saying .
fe008 [ s:s] : So you say , " Sev e − sevent y eight point t wo " , or
what ev er .
fe008 [ s] : And t here ’s no way of capt uring t hat if you ’re put t ing t he
num bers off t o t he side .
fe008 [ s.%−] : You can’t have t he sev en and [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qw] : So what ’s t o t he left of t hese ?
fe008 [ s.%−−] : The left is i
fe008 [ s^ rt .%−−] : so exam ple t he very first one ,
fe008 [ s:s] : it would be , spelled out in words , " point five " .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , t hat ’s what I was asking .

m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : Only it ’s spelled out in words .
fe008 [ s] : So i t his is also spelled out in [ disfm arker] in words .
m e011 [ s:s|s^ bk] : Point FIVE , yeah .
fe008 [ s:s] : " Point five . "
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Good .
fe008 [ s:s] : And t hen , in here , " NUMS " ,
fe008 [ s] : so it ’s not going t o be m ist aken as a gloss .
fe008 [ s:s] : It com es out as " NUMS quot e dot five " .
m e011 [ fg|s.%−−] : OK now , t he ot her exam ple is , in t he glosses right
t here ,
fe008 [ s^ ft .%] : Thank you .
m e011 [ s:s] : " gloss one one one dash one t hree zero " .
m e001 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ %−] : Well now [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qw] : What [ disfm arker] what ’s t o t he left of t hat ?
fe008 [ s:s] : In t hat case it ’s people saying t hings like " one one one
dash so − and − so "
fe008 [ s:s] : or t hey ’re saying uh " t wo [ disfm arker] I m ean zero "
what ev er .
m e011 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : And in t hat case , it ’s part of t he num bers t ask ,
fe008 [ s] : and it ’s not gonna be included in t he read digit s anyway ,
fe008 [ s.%−] : so [ disfm arker] I m in t he uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : So t here will be a " NUMS " t ag on t hose lines ?
fe008 [ s^ na] : There is .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : I ’ve added t hat all now t oo .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Good .
m e001 [ s.%−−] : There ’s a " num bers " t ag [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ co] : Wait .
m e001 [ s^ fa|s^ df] : I ’m sorry I ’m [ disfm arker] I didn’t follow t hat last
t hing .
fe008 [ s:s] : So , so gloss [ disfm arker] in t he sam e line t hat would
have " gloss quot e one one one dash one t hirt y " , you ’d have a gloss
at t he end of t he line saying , uh , " curly bracket NUMS curly bracket "
.
m e001 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : So if y ou [ disfm arker] if you did a , uh , a " grep m inus V
num s "
fe016 [ s:s] : Oh , so you could do " grep m inus V num s " .
fe016 [ s.%−] : So t hat ’s t he [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : and you get rid of anyt hing t hat was read .
fe016 [ b] : yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : So t here wouldn’t be som et hing like

m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s^ bu:s] : i if som ebody said som et hing like , " Boy , I ’m really
t ired , OK . " and t hen st art ed reading t hat would be on a separat e line
?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe016 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : OK great .
fe016 [ s^ df] : Cuz I was doing t he " grep m inus V " quick and dirt y
fe016 [ s] : and looked like t hat was working OK ,
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Good .
fe016 [ b] : Great .
fe008 [ b] : Yep .
fe016 [ qw] : Now why do we [ disfm arker] what ’s t he reason for having
like t he point five have t he " NUMS " on it ?
fe016 [ qr^ e^ rt ] : Is t hat just like when t hey ’re t alking about t heir dat a
or som et hing ?
fe008 [ s.%−−] : This is m ore because [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ qrr.%−−] : Or [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s:s] : Oh t hese are all t hese , t he " NUMS point " , t his all where
t hey ’re saying " point " som et hing or ot her .
fe016 [ s.%−] : These are all like inside t he spont aneous [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : And t he ot her t hing t oo is for readabilit y of t he t ranscript .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I m ean if you ’re t ry ing t o follow t his while you ’re reading
it it ’s really hard t o read , you know [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s:s] : eh , " so in t he dat a colum n fiv e has " , you know , " one
point five com pared t o sevent y nine point six " ,
fe008 [ s] : it ’s like when you see t he words it ’s really hard t o follow
t he argum ent .
fe008 [ s] : And t his is just really a [ disfm arker] a way of som eone who
would handle t h t he dat a in a m ore discourse − y way t o be able t o
follow what ’s being said .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Oh OK .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Label it .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : I see .
fe008 [ s] : So t his is where Chuck ’s , um , overall h archit ect ure com es
in ,
fe008 [ s] : where we ’re gonna have a m ast er file of t he channelized
dat a .
fe008 [ s] : Um , t here will be script s t hat are writ t en t o convert it int o
t hese t t hese m ain t wo uses
fe008 [ s] : and t h som e script s will t ake it down t h e int o a f a for t a
t ake it t o a form at t hat ’s usable for t he recognizer
fe008 [ s] : an uh , ot her script s will t ake it t o a form t hat ’s usable for
t he [ disfm arker] for linguist ics an and discourse analysis .

fe008 [ s] : And , um , t he im plicat ion t hat [ disfm arker] t hat I have is
t hat t h t he m ast er copy will st ay unchanged .
fe008 [ s] : These will just be t hings t hat are generat ed ,
m e011 [ b] : Right
fe008 [ fh] : and
fe016 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : e by using script s .
m e011 [ s] : Mast er copies of superset .
fe008 [ s] : When t hings change t hen t he [ disfm arker] t he script will
cham change
fe008 [ s] : but t he [ disfm arker] but t here won’t be st ored copies of
[ disfm arker] in different versions of t hings .
m e011 [ b] : Good .
fe016 [ s] : So , I guess I ’d have one request here
fe016 [ s] : which is just , um , m aybe t o m ake it m ore robust ,
fe016 [ s] : t h t hat t he t ag , what ever you would choose for t his t ype of
" NUMS " [ com m ent ] where it ’s inside t he spont aneous speech , is
different t han t he t ag t hat you use for t he read speech .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s^ aa|s] : Right . That would argue for changing t he ot her ones
t o be " digit s " or som et hing .
fe016 [ s^ df] : Um , t hat way w if we m ake a m ist ake parsing , or
som et hing , we don’t see t he " point fiv e " ,
fe016 [ s.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] or it ’s not t here , t hen we
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : a Just [ disfm arker] an And act ually for t hings like " seven
eight hs " , or
fe016 [ s^ df] : people do fract ions t oo I guess ,
fe016 [ s^ cs] : you [ disfm arker] m aybe you want one overall t ag for
sort of t hat would be sim ilar t o t hat ,
fe008 [ %−] : Except [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : As long as t hey ’re sep as t hey ’re different st rings t hat we
[ disfm arker] t hat ’ll m ake our p sort of processing m ore robust .
fe008 [ %−] : Well [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ df] : Cuz we really will get rid of ev eryt hing t hat has t he "
NUMS " st ring in it .
m e018 [ s:s] : I suppose what y ou could do is just m ake sure t hat you
get rid of everyt hing t hat has " curly brace NUMS curly brace " .
fe008 [ %−] : Well [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Ex − exact ly .
fe008 [ s^ aa^ r] : Ex act ly .
m e018 [ s.%−] : I m ean t hat would be t he [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ na] : That was [ disfm arker] t hat was m y m ot ivat ion .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : And i t hese can be changed , like I said .

fe008 [ s] : You know , I m ean , as I said I was considering changing it
t o " digit s " .
fe008 [ s] : And , it just [ disfm arker] i you know , it ’s just a m at t er of
deciding on what ev er it is , and being sure t he script s know .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : It would probably be safer , if you ’re willing , t o have a
separat e t ag
fe016 [ s^ df] : just because um , t hen we know for sure .
fe016 [ s^ df^ e] : And we can also do count s on t hem wit hout having t o
do t he processing .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : But you ’re right ,
fe016 [ s^ ba] : we could do it t his way ,
fe016 [ s^ ba^ e] : it [ disfm arker] it should work .
fe016 [ fh] : Um ,
m e018 [ fg|s.%−] : Yeah , and it m akes it [ disfm arker] I guess t he t hing
about [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : but it it ’s probably not hard for a person t o t ell t he
difference
fe016 [ s^ df] : because one ’s in t he cont ext of a [ disfm arker] you
know , a t ranscribed word st ring ,
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : The ot her t hing is y ou can get really so m inut e wit h t hese
t hings
fe016 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : and increase t he size of t he files and t he re and decrease
t he readabilit y t o such an ext ent by sim ply som et hing like " percent " .
fe008 [ s^ ba^ bd] : Now I [ disfm arker] I could have adopt ed a sim ilar
conv ent ion for " percent " ,
fe008 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : but som ehow percent is not so hard , you know ?
m e011 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s] : i It ’s just when you have t hese point s and you ’re t rying t o
figure out where t he decim al places are [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : And we could always add it lat er .
fe008 [ s] : Percent ’s easy t o det ect .
fe008 [ s] : Point however is [ disfm arker] is uh a word t hat has a couple
different m eanings .
fe008 [ s] : And you ’ll find bot h of t hose in one of t hese m eet ings ,
fe008 [ s] : where he ’s saying " well t he first point I wanna m ake is so −
and − so "
fe008 [ s] : and he goes t hrough four point s ,
fe008 [ s] : and also has all t hese decim als .
m e018 [ qw.%−−] : So Liz , what does t he recognizer do ,
fe008 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ fh] : uh ,

m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ qw] : what does t he SRI recognizer out put for t hings like t hat ?
m e018 [ s^ e] : " sev en point fiv e " .
m e018 [ qy.%−] : Does it out put t he word [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : " Sev en point fiv e " .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Right ,
m e011 [ s] : Well , t he num bers ?
m e018 [ s^ bu^ e] : t he word " seven " ?
m e018 [ s^ bu^ e] : The num ber " seven " ?
fe016 [ s] : The word .
m e018 [ s^ m |s^ bk] : The word " seven " , OK .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So I ’d [ disfm arker] so " I ’d like [ disfm arker] I ’d like t o t alk
about point five " .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : And [ disfm arker] and act ually , you know t he language
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : it ’s t he sam e point , act ually ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : t he [ disfm arker] t he p y ou know , t he word " t o " and t he
word y t h " going t o " and " t o go t o "
fe016 [ s:s] : t hose are t wo different " t o ’s "
fe016 [ fh|s] : and so t here ’s no dist inct ion t here .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s.%−−:s.%−−] : It ’s just [ disfm arker] just t he word " point " has
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : Yeah , every word has only one , yeah e one version
fe016 [ s.%−−] : ev en if [ disfm arker] ev en if it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s:s] : A act ually even like t he word " read " [ com m ent ] and "
read "
fe016 [ s] : Those are t wo different words .
fe016 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : They ’re spelled t he sam e way , right ?
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s:s] : And t hey ’re st ill gonna be t ranscribed as READ .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ fh] : So ,
fe016 [ fh|s] : yeah , I [ disfm arker] I like t he idea of having t his in t here ,
fe016 [ s] : I just [ disfm arker] I was a lit t le bit worried t hat , um , t he t ag
for rem ov ing t he read speech [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ qh^ df] : because i What if we have like " read let t ers "
fe016 [ s^ e] : or , I don’t know ,
m e011 [ s^ cs] : We m ight wanna [ disfm arker] just a separat e t ag t hat
say s it ’s read .
fe016 [ s] : like " read som et hing "
fe016 [ s^ 2] : like " read "

fe016 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : yeah , basically .
m e001 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : But ot her t han t hat I it sounds great .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : OK ?
m e011 [ qy^ rt ] : Are we done ?
fe008 [ s] : Well I want ed t o say also regarding t he channelized dat a ,
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh , I guess we ’re not done .
fe008 [ s] : t hat , um , Thilo request ed , um , t hat we ge get som e
segm ent s done by hand t o e e s reduce t he size of t he t im e bins
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : wh like was Chuc − Chuck was m ent ioning earlier
fe008 [ s:s] : t hat , um , t hat , um , if you [ disfm arker] if you said , " Oh "
and it was in part of a really long , s com plex , overlapping segm ent ,
t hat t he sam e st art and end t im es would be held for t hat one
m e011 [ %−] : Well [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ e^ rt ] : as for t he longer ut t erances ,
m e011 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g] : We did t hat for one m eet ing , right ,
fe008 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g] : so you have t hat dat a don’t you ?
m n014 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , t hat ’s t he t raining dat a .
fe008 [ s] : And he request ed t hat t here be , uh , sim ilar , uh , sam ples
done for fiv e m inut e st ret ches c involving a variet y of speakers and
ov erlapping sect i sect ions .
fe008 [ s] : He gav e m e [ disfm arker] he did t he [ disfm arker] very nice ,
he [ disfm arker] he did som e shopping t hrough t he dat a
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : and found segm ent s t hat would be useful .
fe008 [ s] : And at t his point , all four of t he ones t hat he specified
have been done .
fe008 [ s] : In addit ion t he I ’ve [ disfm arker] I have t he t ranscribers
ex panding t he am ount t hat t hey ’re doing act ually .
m n014 [ s^ ba] : Oh great .
fe008 [ s] : So right now , um , I know t hat as of t oday we got an ext ra
fift een m inut es of t hat t ype ,
fe008 [ s] : and I ’m having t hem ex pand t he realm on eit her side of
t hese places where t hey ’ve already st art ed .
m n014 [ s^ ba] : Oh great .
m n014 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : But if [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] you know , and I
[ disfm arker] and he ’s gonna give m e som e m ore sect ions t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat he t hinks would be useful for t his purpose .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ df] : Because it ’s t rue ,

fe008 [ s^ e] : I m ean , if we could do t he [ disfm arker] t he m ore fine
grained t uning of t his , uh , using an algorit hm , t hat would be so m uch
m ore efficient .
fe008 [ fh] : And , um .
fe008 [ s] : So t his is gonna be [ pause] useful t o expand t his .
m n014 [ s^ cs] : So I [ disfm arker] I t hought we [ disfm arker] we sh we sh
perhaps we should t ry t o [ disfm arker] t o st art wit h t hose channelized
v ersions
m n014 [ s^ e] : just t o [ disfm arker] just t o t ry it .
m n014 [ s^ cs] : Give it [ disfm arker] Giv e one t r t ranscriber t he
[ disfm arker] t he channelized v ersion of [ disfm arker] of m y speech −
nonspeech det ect ion
m n014 [ s] : and look if [ disfm arker] if t hat ’s helpful for t hem ,
m n014 [ s] : or just let t hem t ry if [ disfm arker] if t hat ’s bet t er
m n014 [ s.%−] : or If t hey [ disfm arker] if t hey can [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bu] : You m ean t o st art from scrat ch f in a brand new
t ranscript ?
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’d be excellent .
fe008 [ s^ aa|s^ ba] : Yeah , t hat ’d be really great .
fe008 [ s] : As it st ands we ’re st ill in t he phase of sort of , um ,
cleaning up t he ex ist ing dat a
fe008 [ s^ e] : get t ing t hings , uh , in i m m ore t ight t ight ly t im e
[ disfm arker] uh , aligned .
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : I also wanna t ell [ disfm arker] um , I also want ed t o r
raise t he issue t hat [ disfm arker] OK so , t here ’s t his idea we ’re gonna
have t his m ast er copy of t he t ranscript ,
fe008 [ s] : it ’s gonna be m odified by script s t int o t hese t wo different
funct ions .
fe008 [ s.%−] : And act ually t he m ast er [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ aap^ bc] : Two or m ore .
m e018 [ s^ e] : Two or m ore different funct ions .
fe008 [ s^ m ] : Two [ disfm arker] t wo or m ore .
fe008 [ s] : And t hat t he m ast er is gonna be t he channelized version .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : So right now we ’ve t aken t his i init ial one , it was a single
channel basically t he way it was input .
fe008 [ s] : And now , uh , t hanks t o t he advances m ade in t he
int erface , we can from now on use t he channelized part ,
fe008 [ s] : and , um , any changes t hat are m ade get m ade in t he
channelized v ersion kind of t hing .
fe008 [ s] : But I want ed t o get all t he finished [ disfm arker] all t he
checks [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fg|s] : Yeah , so t hat has im plicat ions for your script .
m e001 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

m e001 [ qy ] : So , uh , have t hose [ disfm arker] e e t he vis t he t en
hours t hat have been t ranscribed already , have t hose been
channelized ?
fe008 [ s^ na] : Yes , t hey have .
m e001 [ s] : And I know [ disfm arker] I ’ve seen @ @ [ disfm arker] I ’ve
seen t hey ’v e been channelized ,
m e011 [ qy^ bu^ d] : All t en hours ?
fe008 [ s^ aap] : Ex cept for t he m issing t hirt y m inut es .
m e001 [ %−] : but
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Great .
m e001 [ qy .%−] : have t hey uh [ disfm arker] have t hey been [ disfm arker]
has t he t im e [ disfm arker] have t he t im e m arkings been adjust ed , uh ,
p on a per channel [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Uh , for [ disfm arker] for a t ot al of like t went y m
fe008 [ s.%−−] : f for a t ot al of [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ t 1.%−−] : Let ’s see , four t im es [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : t ot al of about an [ disfm arker] [ pause] t hirt y m inut es .
fe008 [ s] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s been t he case .
m e001 [ %−] : So ,
fe008 [ s] : And plus t he t raining , what ever you have .
m e001 [ s^ no] : I guess , I m ean , I don’t know if we should t alk about
t his now , or not ,
m e001 [ %−] : but I
m e011 [ s^ aap] : Well it ’s just we ’re [ pause] m issing t ea .
m e001 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , I know .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e001 [ s^ ar|qy ] : No , but I m ean m y quest ion is like should I wait unt il
all of t hose are processed , and channelized ,
m e001 [ s^ e] : like t he t im e m arkings are adjust ed before I do all t he
processing ,
m e001 [ s^ e] : and we st art like branching off int o t he [ disfm arker] int o
t he [ disfm arker] our layer of uh t ranscript s .
fe008 [ s] : Well , you know t he problem [ disfm arker] t he problem is
t hat som e [ disfm arker] som e of t he adjust m ent s t hat t hey ’re m aking
are t o bring [ disfm arker] are t o com bine bins t hat were [ disfm arker]
t im e bins which were previously separat e .
fe008 [ s] : And t he reason t hey do t hat is som et im es t here ’s a word
t hat ’s cut off .
m e001 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : And so , i i i it ’s t rue t hat it ’s likely t o be adjust ed in t he
way t hat t he words are m ore com plet e .
fe008 [ fh] : And ,
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : so I [ disfm arker] it ’s gonna be a m ore reliable t hing
m e001 [ s] : No I know [ disfm arker] I know t hat adjust ing t hose t hings
are gonna [ disfm arker] is gonna m ake it bet t er .

fe008 [ s.%−] : and I ’m not sure [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e001 [ s] : I m ean I ’m sure about t hat ,
m e001 [ qy ] : but do y ou have like a t im e fram e when you can expect
like all of it t o be done ,
m e001 [ qo.%−−] : or when you ex pect t hem t o finish it , or [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : Well part ly it depends on how [ disfm arker] um , how e
effect ive it will be t o apply an algorit hm
fe008 [ s^ df] : because i t his t akes t im e ,
m e001 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ df] : you know , it t akes a couple hours t t o do , uh , t en
m inut es .
m e001 [ b] : Yeah .
m e001 [ s^ aa|s^ ba] : Yeah , I don’t doubt it .
m e001 [ fh] : Um , so .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : So right now t he [ disfm arker] what you ’re doing is you
’re t aking t he [ disfm arker] uh , t he o original version
m e018 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g] : and you ’re sort of channelizing yourself , right
?
m e001 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . I ’m doing it m yself .
m e001 [ s] : I m ean i if t he t im e m arkings aren’t different across
channels ,
m e001 [ s^ rt ] : like t he channelized version really doesn’t have any
m ore inform at ion .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e001 [ s] : So , I was just [ disfm arker] I m ean , originally I had done
before like t he channelized versions were com ing out .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e001 [ fh] : Um ,
m e001 [ s.%−] : and so it ’s a quest ion of like what [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : So I [ disfm arker] I t h I t hink probably t he way it ’ll go is t hat
, you know , when we m ake t his first general version and t hen st art
working on t he script , t hat script @ @ t hat will be m a you know
prim arily com e from what you ’ve done , um , we ’ll need t o work on a
channelized v ersion of t hose originals .
m e001 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e001 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : And so it should be pret t y m uch ident ical t o what you have
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e018 [ s] : t ex cept for t he one t hat t hey ’ve already t ight ened t he
boundaries on .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e001 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e018 [ fh] : Um ,

fe008 [ fg|%−] : Yeah , I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fh] : So
fe008 [ b] : yeah .
m e018 [ s] : uh , and t hen probably what will happen is as t he
t ranscribers finish t ight ening m ore and m ore , you know , t hat original
v ersion will get updat ed
m e018 [ s] : and t hen we ’ll rerun t he script and produce bet t er uh
v ersions .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s] : But t he [ disfm arker] I guess t he ef t he effect for you guys ,
because you ’re pulling out t he lit t le wave form s int o separat e ones ,
t hat would m ean t hese boundaries are const ant ly changing
m e018 [ s] : y ou ’d have t o const ant ly re rerun t hat ,
m e001 [ s^ na] : I know .
m e018 [ s^ cs.%−] : so , m aybe [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ ba^ bd] : But t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s not hard .
fe008 [ %−] : But t hat [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e001 [ s^ aa] : No .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : I I t hink t he harder part is m aking sure t hat t he t ransc
t he t ranscript ion [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : OK .
fe016 [ s] : So if y ou b m erge t wo t hings , t hen you know t hat it ’s t he
sum of t he t ranscript s ,
fe016 [ s] : but if you split inside som et hing , you don’t where t he word
[ disfm arker] which words m oved .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : And t hat ’s wh t hat ’s where it becom es a lit t le bit
[ disfm arker] uh , having t o rerun t he processing .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : The cut t ing of t he waveform s is pret t y t rivial .
m e001 [ b] : Yeah .
m e001 [ s] : I m ean as long as it can all be done aut om at ically , I m ean
, t hen t hat ’s not a concern .
m e001 [ s] : You know , if I just have t o run t hree script s t o ext ract it all
and let it run on m y com put er for an hour and a half , or however long
it t akes t o parse and creat e all t he reference file , t hat ’s not a
problem .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e001 [ fh] : Um ,

m e001 [ fh] : so y eah .
m e001 [ s] : As long as we ’re at t hat point .
m e001 [ s^ e] : And I know exact ly like what t he st eps will work
[ disfm arker] what ’s going on , in t he edit ing process ,
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e001 [ fh] : so .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ t ^ t c] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker] I I m ean I could [ disfm arker]
t here were ot her checks t hat I did ,
fe008 [ s^ t ] : but it ’s [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat we ’ve [ disfm arker]
unless you t hink t here ’s anyt hing else , I t hink t hat I ’ve covered it .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : I can’t t hink of any of t he [ disfm arker] ot her ones .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Great .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ fe] : Oop !
m e011 [ s^ ba^ fe] : Man !
