m e011 [ fh] : and uh [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ cs] : So what I was t hinking is we could st art just by filling it

m e025 [ s^ co] : Just writ e it down .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : What are we [ disfm arker] why are we writ ing it down ?
m e011 [ s] : So t hat [ pause] when we [ pause] t ranscribe t he dat a we

and what m ike t hey were on and all t hat sort of t hing .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : OK That ’s good .
m e013 [ s] : So I don’t need t o fill t hat out right now .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : So m aybe we should just say it .
m e011 [ qw^ ng^ rt ] : W Why don’t you want t o fill it out right now ?
m e025 [ fg] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ bu.%−−] : Just so t hat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So t hen we ’re not spending t he t im e writ ing it out .
m e013 [ s^ e] : So t hat we ’re spending t he t im e t alking .
m e025 [ s^ cs] : Well , how about [ pause] you give m e one of t hose
m e025 [ s^ cs] : and we can fill it out
m e025 [ s^ cs] : and Morgan can read
m e025 [ s] : and t hen we can do it like t hat .
m e013 [ s^ df] : I ’m just uh concerned about a bunch of dead t im e
while we all sit here and fill out t he t hings .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah , y eah , yeah .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g.%] : Right ?
m e011 [ s] : And so y ou have t o be sure t o pause [ pause] bet ween

doing it t hat way .
m e013 [ b] : Oh .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ fg|s] : OK , so t his is Morgan .
m e013 [ s] : I ’m going t o read som e num bers now .

m e025 [ s^ by] : This is [ disfm arker] t hese are t hings we will find out .
m e011 [ s] : That ’ll be an issue .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ no] : I don’t know if I said m ine was t ranscript zero ,

m e013 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : That ’s a lit t le bit .
m e025 [ qy^ rt ] : Can I have som et hing t o writ e on t he back of ?
m e013 [ fg|qo] : So , so where are we in t his ?
m e025 [ s^ ft ] : Thanks .

m e013 [ s] : Let ’s see , so we now [ disfm arker] we now have a few
m ikes t hat work .
m e013 [ qw] : How long did it t ake you t o set t his up ?
m e025 [ s^ fe] : Oh !
m e025 [ s] : It didn’t [ disfm arker] doesn’t t ake [ disfm arker] Well , I
m ean as y ou see we haven’t really set it up t hat well , but it doesn’t
[ disfm arker] it doesn’t t ake long t o set up .
m e025 [ h|s] : I m ean , We just cam e up here [ pause] one night aft er
recording so it t ook like t went y m inut es som et hing like t hat .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ e] : Right and t hat [ disfm arker] t hat included a fair
am ount of fiddling around , since it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s m ore or less t he
first t im e we ’ve t ried t o do it .
m e025 [ fh] : I m ean it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ fg|s.%−] : Yeah , [ pause] I m ean t he equipm ent [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ fg] : Right .
m e025 [ s] : The equip Me and Adam went t hrough it yest erday , just
looked at ev ery t hing .
m e025 [ s] : But it ’s all kind of here and set up , so it ’s just a quest ion
of t urning it all on .
m e025 [ s] : And , um [ disfm arker] running t he program .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , ev event ually we ’ll want t o like t ape t hat over and
run t hem up t hrough t he cent er so t hat wires aren’t [ disfm arker]
aren’t [ disfm arker] people aren’t t ripping over t he wires and so on .
m e025 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ qr^ rt ] : Are we gonna [ disfm arker] I m ean , is it gonna be over
t here , or is it gonna be in t here ?
m e025 [ h|s] : Um , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s gonna b it ’s [ disfm arker] for
reasons [ disfm arker] because of t he m icrophones runs we want t hat
chunk t here .
m e025 [ s] : There ’s m ore equipm ent in t here .
m e025 [ s] : But t here ’s [ disfm arker] [ pause] t he idea is t hat t here are
[ pause] t hese m icrophones on t he t able ,
m e025 [ s] : t here are som e cables com ing down [ pause] sort of under
a nice [ pause] m at ,
m e025 [ s] : and t hen t hat ’s [ disfm arker] [ pause] t hey [ disfm arker] a
bunch of t hem get sort of conv erged wit h digit al t here .
m e025 [ s] : And t he idea is t hat t his get s replaced by a cabinet wit h
doors , so t hat [ disfm arker] [ pause] so t hat it ’s not [ pause] open t o
fiddling .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So t hat ’s what ’s gonna happen .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e025 [ %−] : That ’s
m e011 [ qr^ rt ] : Do we have like a [ pause] cabinet on order or do we
just need t o do t hat ?
m e025 [ s] : We need t o do t hat .
m e025 [ s] : It ’s on a list of t hings t o do .

m e025 [ s] : I keep on hoping t hat [ pause] t hey ’re gonna get done but
t hey don’t .
m e011 [ s] : Well , I [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] I can help t hem get done
um one quest ion is budget .
m e025 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ b] : Yeah !
m e011 [ qy ] : Do we have any m oney at all t hat we can go out and
spend on t hings like cabinet s or a hard drive or t hings like t hat .
m e013 [ h|s^ no] : Oh [ disfm arker] I m ean , I don’t know .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Did we s did we spend our [ disfm arker] t he budget
already t hat we had ?
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ h|qw^ rt ] : Uh , how m uch [ pause] are we t alking about here ?
m e025 [ h|s^ no] : Um . I don’t know .
m e025 [ s] : A cabinet is probably going t o cost [ pause] a hundred
dollars , t wo hundred dollars som et hing like t hat .
m e013 [ s^ na] : Yeah , I m ean , y ou know , we [ disfm arker] we can
spend under a t housand dollars or som et hing wit hout [ disfm arker]
wit hout worry ing about it .
m e025 [ fh] : I m ean .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , I t hink [ disfm arker] um [ pause] I ’m m ore worried
about t hings being kept in a funky st at e long enough t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat uh st uff get s broken or [ disfm arker] or you know .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Well , I t hink our int ent ion at t his point is when we ’re not
using it t o record a m eet ing we ’ll coil t hem all up and put t hem under
[ pause] so t hat people will not be t ripping over t hem and so on .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e025 [ s] : But , [ pause] well we should get t o a [ disfm arker] a nice
kind of working st at e of our set up [ pause] as quickly as possible .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s:s] : Yeah , and t here ’s also t he m inor m at t er , it ’d be
kind of nice t o able t o [ pause] bring people in and say " yes , t his is
where we do such − and − such " , and t hen be able t o see uh , you
know , [ pause] som e kind of [ disfm arker] I m ean it ’s less im port ant
t han doing what we ’re doing right now
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e011 [ %−] : Not have it [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e025 [ s] : I m ean [ pause] t here ’s one big issue wit h t he equipm ent
st ill , which is um ult im at ely we ’re gonna [ disfm arker] well t he idea is
t o hav e any num ber of t hese wired headset s ,

m e025 [ s^ rt ] : but t here ’s t his am plificat ion problem .
m e025 [ s] : I built t his t hing , it ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
v ery noisy .
m e025 [ s] : We ’re act ually recording [ disfm arker] I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m
going t hrough it at t he m om ent , [ pause] but it ’s so noisy t hat I am
not using for t his .
m e025 [ s] : it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s designed t o be used for t he
[ disfm arker] for t he deskt op m eet ing as well .
m e025 [ s] : But I ’m using [ disfm arker] running t hat t hrough m y uh
[ pause] dam p m achine as a pre − am p as an alt ernat ive .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Well , we should be able t o just go buy som e pream ps ,
[ pause] I would t hink .
m e025 [ s^ am ] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s.%−−] : It ’s just [ disfm arker] it eh
m e025 [ s^ nd] : You see how clum sy t his is
m e025 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e025 [ s] : I hav e t o use t hese bat t eries t o bias t hem .
m e025 [ s] : And I ’m only get t wo channels and t here ’re a bunch of
[ disfm arker] [ pause] There are like t hree connect ors in t he circuit .
m e025 [ s] : The t hing is , like , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not s it ’s not t hat
t he t hing doesn’t ex ist [ pause] com m ercially , but t here isn’t one unit
which does t he whole t hing in one [ disfm arker] in one [ pause] swoop .
m e025 [ s] : So it seem ed like it was a good idea t o m ake one .
m e025 [ fh|s] : um And I ’m st ill not sure .
m e025 [ s] : I m ean , I t hink [ pause] I probably know how t o fix t his .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s] : I can probably build it bet t er so it doesn’t hav e such noise
, but it ’s kind of a buy .
m e011 [ s] : Well , ult im at ely we ’re gonna need t o build one anyway .
m e013 [ qy ] : Are we ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m e025 [ s^ nd.%−] : Well , we could just [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ df^ rt ] : Because we we ’re gonna have t o put it in a PDA .
m e013 [ s^ am .%−−] : Well .
m e011 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : If we have m icrophones in a PDA it ’s gonna need bias
and [ pause] a pre − am p .
m e013 [ s] : I guess I ’d sort of figured t hat [ disfm arker] t hat Jim would
do t hat at som e point .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s^ ar^ bsc.%−−] : Well n
m e025 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s] : Jim is busy at t he m om ent .
m e025 [ s] : That ’s t he problem .

m e025 [ s] : I was kind of hoping t hat Jim was going t o build t his box .
m e025 [ s] : But um [ disfm arker] but he hasn’t had t im e .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s] : Well , I t hink [ disfm arker] I t hink he is quit e int erest ed in
doing it .
m e025 [ fh] : But .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ h|s^ cs^ t c] : Well If it ’s t oo noisy and if t here ’s som et hing we
can buy , again for , you know , m oderat e am ount of price , even if it
t akes a couple boxes or som et hing , m aybe we should just do it .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : And t hen [ disfm arker] and t hen lat er we can
[ pause] uh replace it wit h [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Because t here m ay be ot her considerat ions [ pause] t hat
will go int o t he design .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , uh our get t ing som e experience wit h t his m ay help
t o det erm ine [ pause] som e of t hings t hat are [ disfm arker] I don’t know
[ disfm arker] m ight change t his design , So .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : There was uh a st at em ent m ade uh which I don’t t hink is
right , by t he way , but [ disfm arker] [ pause] t here was a st at em ent
m ade at t he uh DARPA Com m unicat or m eet ing I was at recent ly t hat
um [ pause] [ vocalsound] m icrophone [ disfm arker] m ult iple
m icrophones [ pause] at a dist ance of less t han [ pause] t hree feet or
som et hing like t hat were t ot ally useless ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : com plet ely irrelevant .
m e025 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Oh !
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ qr^ bu^ rt .%−−] : You [ disfm arker] you m ean for noise cancelling
, or [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s^ aa^ m ] : for nois noise cancelling .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , m y count er argum ent is [ disfm arker] is an
[ disfm arker] uh uh um , a whit e rat .
m e013 [ s] : uh , which [ pause] has t h it ’s t wo m icrophones
ex ceedingly close t oget her and it works pret t y well .
m e025 [ b] : Oh .
m e013 [ fh] : Um but [ disfm arker] Yeah .
m e025 [ b] : OK .
m e025 [ s^ bd] : This happened .
m e011 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : Do t hey m ean [ pause] om nidirect ional ,
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : is t hat t heir point ?
m e011 [ s] : I m ean all t he noise cancelling m ikes , t hey ’re [ disfm arker]
y ou know , t hey ’re a few m m illim et ers away from each ot her point ing
in different direct ions .

m e025 [ s] : I t hink [ disfm arker] [ pause] uh , I m ean , uh m y guess is
t hat m eans it ’s just t hat if it ’s [ disfm arker] if it ’s near field , [ pause]
t he m at hem at ics of beam [ disfm arker] [ pause] beam st eering is
different .
m e011 [ %−−] : But .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see .
m e025 [ s] : If t he f if t he wavefront s are not approxim at ely planar
[ pause] t hen y ou can’t just do delay and sum and expect it t o work .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ bu] : It ’s [ disfm arker] Oh , OK , so t hey ’re not t alking
about [ pause] how far apart t he m ikes are , t hey ’re t alking about how
far t hey are from t he speaker .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : I guess .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : But I t hink t hat if [ disfm arker] m y point is I guess if you
[ disfm arker] if y ou have a um [ disfm arker] a uh s a volum e in bet ween
[ pause] t he t wo [ disfm arker] t he t wo uh uh sensors and you do
som et hing clev erer , t here clearly are ways [ pause] t o get m ore out of

m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah , yeah .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Right , right , right .
m e025 [ s^ ng] : I m ean t he [ disfm arker] um The [ disfm arker] t he weird
t hing is t hat act ually [ pause] delay in som e beam − form ing is not
[ disfm arker] is not t he clever t hing t o do .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he underwat er guys do
t his st uff which is [ pause] different .
m e025 [ s] : And it act ually m eans t hat y ou should get t he m icrophones
as close t oget her as possible .
m e025 [ s] : Rat her t han t rying t o get t hem far apart so you can get
[ pause] separat ion , you sort of [ disfm arker] [ pause] you want t hem
v ery close .
m e025 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] And [ pause] t he m at h is t oo difficult for
m e t o underst and but it ’s [ disfm arker] but it ’s t here .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Well , t here are various point s in m eet ing where people
were m aking uh uh very st rong st at em ent s as a m at t er of fact , like

m e013 [ s] : and [ pause] t his was one of t hem t hat [ pause] was kind of
[ pause] funny .
m e013 [ s] : Um but I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] what I
t ake it t o m ean is doing [ disfm arker] doing t he dum b t hing uh wit h t wo
m icrophones would be very difficult t o get t oo m uch out of it
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .

m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df] : but I t hink it will be int erest ing t o do ot her t hings t hat
aren’t dum b .
m e013 [ s] : So I [ disfm arker] I st ill t hink it ’s pot ent ially [ com m ent ]
[ pause] int erest ing t o do t hat .
m e011 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s:s] : Alt hough we we ’ll have t o be uh a aware of t his if we ’re
writ ing proposals about it , wherever , t hat t here m ay well be reviewers
who will say , " well everyone knows t hat [ pause] you can’t get anyt hing
out of it if it ’s [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] if it ’s close " .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Do t hey believe you can get speaker locat ion out of it
?
m e011 [ s] : Cuz t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s one way we could sneak it
in .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Uh , t hat is an int erest ing point .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ na.%−] : Cert ainly you can get som e [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s.%−−] : Well we could [ disfm arker] I m ean .
m e025 [ s] : By t he t im e [ disfm arker] [ pause] We ’ll have [ disfm arker]
we ’ll have dat a so we can act ually [ pause] you know , dem onst rat e
t hat .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fg] : Well .
m e013 [ s] : Hopefully .
m e011 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Oh , you m ean for locat ion ?
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : Well , we ’re get t ing som e [ disfm arker] we we ’re get t ing
som e right now .
m e011 [ s] : Depends on who ’s working on it .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , right .
m e011 [ s] : but som eone has t o writ e som e soft ware t o [ disfm arker] t o
act ually do it .
m e025 [ b] : Right .
m e025 [ b] : Right .
m e025 [ %−] : But I m ean .
m e013 [ s] : Well som eone som eone m ight be int erest ed in
[ disfm arker] in it .
m e011 [ s^ aa^ m ] : Som eone m ight .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : Oh t hat ’s uh [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ cs] : I was just t hinking one t hing we m ay wanna do is put
t he fake PDA right in front of som eone [ pause] inst ead of in t he m iddle
of t he t able like we have it now .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .

m e011 [ s] : on t he t hought t hat [ disfm arker] m y vision of it is you know
each of us will have our lit t le PDA in front of us [ pause] and so t he
acoust ics [ disfm arker] uh you m ight want t o t ry t o m at ch t he acoust ics
.
m e013 [ s^ am ] : May be .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ arp^ ng] : But on t he ot her hand , [ pause] suppose t hat uh
, you ’re t he only one uh who is advanced enough in t his t hinking t o
act ually bring such a PDA t o [ disfm arker] t o a m eet ing
m e011 [ s^ nd] : No , and I don’t need t o m eet wit h t hose people .
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] and
t herefore you bring it in ,
m e013 [ s] : and y ou probably want it t o be as near t o people as
possible so y ou m ight in fact shov e it t o t he m iddle of t he t able .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Well .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Yep , yep .
m e025 [ s^ cs] : For t hose t hose we can m ake several [ disfm arker]
sev eral m ore of t hese [ com m ent ] and t hen we can have act ual
[ pause] recording wit h you know t hree [ pause] P D
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Well , I t hink we should .
m e013 [ s^ cs^ e] : I m ean , I t hink at least wit h t wo .
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e011 [ s^ aa^ m ] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Because uh one of t he t h one of t he fant asies t hat
was at least fun t o t alk about was t hat uh
m e013 [ s] : uh OK m aybe you t h [ pause] y ou ’re [ disfm arker] [ pause]
t he range of t hings you can do wit h m ult iple m icrophones is lim it ed if
t hey ’re a few inches apart ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but what if you have t wo of t hese t hings ?
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s:s] : And y ou know we have t his [ disfm arker] t his idea of t he
handshake [ pause] back and fort h and say " I ’m here , I ’m here "
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s:s] : " We ’re now an array . "
m e025 [ b] : Right , right .
m e025 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s.%−−] : And t hat [ disfm arker] t hat seem s very uh [ pause] easy
t o believ e scenario , I m ean , given t he num ber of palm pilot s we ’ve
got on t he t able right now , so .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right .
m e011 [ s] : Three ,
m e011 [ qy^ d^ g] : right ?

m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah
m e011 [ s] : So I guess t his a pret t y dense group
m e011 [ s] : but it it ’s get t ing a lot higher .
m e025 [ s.%−−] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker] But t hat [ disfm arker] it ’s
m e025 [ s] : We ’re not , even , you know [ pause] [ disfm arker] It ’s
[ disfm arker] we ’re just [ disfm arker] It ’s not like we [ disfm arker] We
[ disfm arker] we m ay be t echnical , but we ’re not part icularly PDA
people .
m e025 [ s] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] That ’s just how it is .
m e011 [ s^ nd] : Well , I ’m t rying t o be .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Well , I know .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Well , t hat ’s t rue .
m e025 [ fh] : I m ean .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : Ex cept I s got a PDA way before [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Well I was doing hand I was doing wearable com put ers at
Boeing , so I guess I sort of count .
m e025 [ b] : OK .
m e011 [ fh] : But .
m e013 [ qo^ t c] : So uh [ disfm arker] so where are we [ pause] uh now ?
m e013 [ s] : I m ean so we ’ve just [ disfm arker] uh We ’re doing t his
recording so we show [ pause] we can [ disfm arker] we ’re capable of
doing recording
m e025 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh t here ’s [ pause] I guess a lit t le m ore wiring t o do or
som et hing t o hav e [ disfm arker] t o have m ore [ disfm arker] if we had
m ore people part icipat ing in t he m eet ing we ’d wouldn’t quit e be ready
for t hat .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Uh .
m e025 [ s] : Well we ’ve got [ disfm arker] we ’ve got [ disfm arker] Right
now we could hav e t wo m ore people on wireless ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e025 [ s] : wit h a t rip t o Leo ’s Audio we could get a t hird ext ra person
on wireless ,
m e025 [ s] : and uh [ pause] right now we could have t hree m ore
[ disfm arker] [ pause] t hree m ore people wearing m ikes like t his , and
t hat would just work .
m e025 [ s] : I m ean I ’m not sure how [ disfm arker] [ pause] how good
t he qualit y is on t his m ike but I t hink it ’s going t o be OK .
m e025 [ s] : So we could act ually hav e [ pause] eight people wit h
[ disfm arker] wit h headset m ikes [ pause] wit h , I m ean , basically no
ex t ra effort .
m e011 [ s^ e] : Well . Five wit h wireless .
m e011 [ s] : So we could have eight .

m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s^ bc] : Nine .
m e011 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Nine .
m e011 [ s^ fa|s^ r] : Excuse m e , nine .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ bs] : Five wit h wireless and four wit hout , and four wit h wired
.
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Um , we don’t have [ pause] headset s t hough .
m e025 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s^ nd] : We have t he um [ disfm arker] t he ones we ’ve been
using , t he ones we got for t he PC .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh , OK so we just have t o c [ pause] wander around
and collect t hem up .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah .
m e025 [ s] : I t hink we have t hree of t hose .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e025 [ s.%−] : So , and t he h
m e011 [ fg|s] : Uh , t here ’s one in m y office .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e025 [ b] : Right , right .
m e025 [ s] : They don’t all work , but t he nice ones , t he um Plan −
Plant ronic ones work .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : So , we ’ll just have t o see if t hat works .
m e013 [ s^ bs] : So a lit t le bit of fut zing , t here ’s t he issue about a
cabinet , we m ight want t o change som e pre − am ps .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So we can do som e m ore recordings but t here ’s
[ disfm arker] t here ’s a lit t le [ disfm arker] lit t le bit of ram p up [ pause] on
t hat ov er t he nex t m ont h , [ pause] say .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah , y eah .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ cc] : Right and also I would like t o work out som e of
t he [ pause] soft ware issues a lit t le m ore [ pause] com plet ely .
m e011 [ s] : So , um , you know , we ’re gonna want t o resam ple and
con and bring t hem over t o anot her m achine and uh [ pause] um
[ pause] organize t he [ disfm arker] how we ’re gonna st ore it all .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : Yeah we were t alking about t hat a lit t le bit ov er coffee
t oday , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat um uh if you downsam ple it sounded like
it cam e [ disfm arker] it sounded like it was som et hing like a gig
gigaby t e an hour if y ou didn’t downsam ple

m e013 [ s^ bu.%−−] : and once y ou downsam pled t hen it was som et hing
like four hundred m egabyt es an hour , if you used all [ disfm arker] if
y ou used all [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ qr^ rt .%−−] : Per channel , or [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : no , if you used all t he channels .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Som et hing like t hat ?
m e025 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : We figured out t hat it was t t welve gig t welve
gigaby t es an hour ?
m e011 [ s^ nd] : It was m ore t han t hat .
m e025 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : For [ disfm arker] for all t he channels ?
m e025 [ qr.%−−] : Was t hat wit h or wit hout t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I t hought it was one gigabyt e .
m e013 [ s] : It couldn’t be t welve .
m e025 [ s^ nd.%−−] : Cuz no , we ’ve only [ disfm arker] no , I m ean we ’ve
only got four gigabyt es and t hat
m e011 [ s] : We said , four gigabyt es [ pause] would give us t went y
m inut es [ pause] before we did anyt hing else .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e025 [ s] : And t hen we [ disfm arker] t hen we cut it in half .
m e011 [ s^ 2.%−] : And t hen we cut in half , [ pause] by [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : How ’d you cut it ?
m e025 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] By s [ pause] saving sixt een bit s on
inst ead of t hirt y [ disfm arker] inst ead of t hirt y − t wo .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , so t hat ’s [ disfm arker] so t hat ’s t wo gigabyt es .
m e013 [ %−] : And t hen [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s^ ar|s^ bc] : Well no I m ean it ’s uh four gigabyt es for fort y
m inut es .
m e011 [ s] : That ’s fort y m inut es
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : So , six gigabyt es .
m e013 [ s] : But t hat ’s at fort y four kilohert z wit h sixt een channels .
m e025 [ s] : Fort y − eight kilohert z , [ pause] yeah .
m e025 [ s] : So we can act ually t riple t hat .
m e013 [ s.%−] : So you can [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa|s.%−] : right , so y ou can
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s^ co] : So , hang on [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s.%−−] : so t hat would [ disfm arker] OK
m e011 [ s] : I cam e out at t he gig an hour , [ pause] at one point .
m e011 [ s] : That [ disfm arker] t hat ’s one com put at ion I did for sixt een
channels , six t een bit .
m e025 [ s^ ar] : Well I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s t wo gig an hour
.
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is it t wo gig an hour ?
m e011 [ s.%−−] : I ’m off by an order of m agni

m e011 [ s^ bd] : That ’s alright .
m e011 [ s] : Order of t wo .
m e025 [ s] : Cuz like , we don’t [ disfm arker] [ pause] Maybe we don’t
[ disfm arker] We don’t need t o sav e all channels ,
m e011 [ s^ bsc^ t 1] : Fact or of t wo .
m e025 [ qy^ d^ g] : right ?
m e025 [ s] : So , on average . We could [ disfm arker] we don’t
[ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] we wouldn’t use all t he channels ,
necessarily .
m e013 [ s] : Oh , we ’ll do t he higher m at h lat er , m aybe but it ’s
[ disfm arker] so it ’s [ disfm arker] so m aybe like a gig or t wo a
[ disfm arker] an hour ,
m e013 [ fh] : um but [ disfm arker] um [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ t 1] : OK , t hat is a bit m ore t han I t hought .
m e011 [ qw] : How m uch here would we have t o reform at t he drive in
t here t o get som e of t he m ore space
m e011 [ s] : cuz it [ disfm arker] I m ean it ’s a nine gig drive and t here ’s
four gig on sc on scrat ch and t here ’s [ pause] about t hree gig unused
, it looked like , on t he hom e direct ory .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ b] : I ’m sure .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ no] : I just don’t know enough about LINUX .
m e011 [ qw] : How hard is it t o [ pause] repart it ion ?
m e025 [ s] : It ’s a pain .
m e011 [ s^ bk^ m ] : It ’s a pain .
m e025 [ s:s] : I m ean , you know , because [ disfm arker] cuz we ’ve got
dat a on " user " ,
m e025 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
m e025 [ s^ e] : And t hen we ’d hav e t o back it all up and [ pause] copy
it back on again .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Yeah so t his ’ll t ake som e t hought cuz we have
[ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] um
m e013 [ s] : If we are in fact gonna have fort y or fift y hours at som e
point and we [ disfm arker] we wanna ha have part of our work be on
feat ure ex t ract ion , it m eans t hat we need t o have waveform s available
[ pause] som ehow .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ b] : Hm m .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : So I ’v e [ disfm arker] I ’ve already creat ed a " U [ disfm arker]
U , doct or speech , dat a , MR " direct ory , [ pause] or had Jane do it
and uh [ pause] um [ disfm arker] but t here ’s not a lot of free space
around .

m e025 [ s^ aa] : No .
m e011 [ s] : So it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it has current ly about four
gig on t he drive t hat I t hink she ’s going t o put it on um .
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : And so we need [ disfm arker] we definit ely need t o go
[ pause] buy [ pause] uh [ pause] y ou know fort y gig [ disfm arker] fift y gig
of driv e [ disfm arker] drive space .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s] : We don’t need all [ disfm arker] we don’t necessarily need it
all on − line .
m e025 [ s] : I m ean it will be different subset s .
m e025 [ s.%−−] : So you won’t [ disfm arker] you won’t , you know , do all
[ pause] sixt een channels in a single [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : That ’s t rue .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : I hadn’t even t hought about t hat , alt hough it ’d be
kind of int erest ing .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : What would you do ?
m e025 [ s] : You t y pically t rain [ disfm arker] I m ean you ’d have fi you ’d
have fift y hours
m e013 [ %−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s^ e] : we ’d only use [ pause] one of t he PZM channels ,
m e025 [ s] : som et hing like t his ,
m e025 [ s] : and so t hat would you wouldn’t have t o use all sixt een
channels [ pause] at once .
m e025 [ s^ e] : But it ’s kind of [ pause] painful for [ disfm arker] because
basically , if we put t hem on C Ds t hen each CD will hav e [ pause] all t he
channels for one [ pause] recording ,
m e025 [ s^ e] : and t hen when y ou want t o build t he P − files , you just
want t o get one of t hose files off each of [ pause] t he sessions
m e025 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , it ’s pret t y horrible .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : So what would we do for t raining ?
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So if we ’re [ disfm arker] if we ’re t raining dist ant
m i we ’d just use one of t hem ?
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s] : Well , m aybe t wo of t hem , but I m ean we wouldn’t use
[ disfm arker] we ’d only use t he dist ant m ikes ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e025 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah so it m ight be four .
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e011 [ s] : But it wouldn’t be sixt een .
m e013 [ s] : Well , alt hough we want ed t o get alignm ent s from t he
close m ike [ pause] st uff .

m e011 [ s^ ng] : But t hat ’s a separat e t raining .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : But y ou don’t want t o be const ant ly t ake [ disfm arker]
put t ing t hat on disk and off disk and on disk .
m e011 [ s^ co] : No wait .
m e011 [ s^ nd] : More disk is bet t er .
m e011 [ s] : Absolut ely .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : I m ean [ pause] m y [ disfm arker] m y preference would
be t o get [ disfm arker] get ourselves a hundred gig of disk .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : The t hing is it ’s really not v ery expensive right now .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : And just not bot her .
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s m ore of an issue of [ disfm arker] of st ruct uring it
wit h uh t he uh Sy s Adm in folks so we don’t panic t hem and figuring out
where it goes .
m e011 [ s^ e] : And back up .
m e013 [ s] : Well , we don’t [ disfm arker] it doesn’t need t o be backed
up .
m e025 [ fg|s.%−] : Right if [ disfm arker] if we [ disfm arker] if we burn it all
on CD − ROM , t hen , um ,
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right , t hen it doesn’t need t o be backed up .
m e025 [ s^ cs] : in fact , we could you know [ disfm arker] we could t hrow
away t he Broadcast News st uff and put it on t here or som et hing like
t hat .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , we were t alking about t hat .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ no] : I ’m not sure if anyone ’s [ pause] st ill using it .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink t he only one using it has been Javier ,
m e025 [ s] : Som ebody used it recent ly .
m e013 [ s] : but at t his point I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] he ’s only been
using it for feat ures t hat he calculat ed quit e a while ago ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : so if nobody else is doing [ pause] feat ure calculat ion
[ disfm arker]
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ cc^ t c] : I ’ll send m ail t o speech local .
m e013 [ qw^ br] : Pardon ?
m e011 [ s] : I ’ll send m ail t o speech local and see if anyone ’s st ill
using it .
m e013 [ qw] : How m uch space is t hat using up ?
m e013 [ qy .%] : Do you have any idea ?
m e025 [ s] : It ’s uh t went y C Ds ,
m e025 [ s] : so t hat ’s t welve gigabyt es .
m e011 [ s] : So t hat would last us for a while .
m e013 [ s^ j] : Yeah , couple hours !
m e013 [ s] : Well , anyway for t his [ disfm arker] t his recording we ’re fine

m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df.%−−] : cuz we ’re only [ disfm arker] we ’re only [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : how m any m ikes are we recording right now ?
m e011 [ h|s] : Well , right now we don’t have any choice .
m e011 [ s] : It r st ill records all sixt een channels .
m e011 [ s] : It ’s just m ost of t hem are all zeroes .
m e011 [ s] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s on our list t oo .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ fg|s.%] : Yeah , well t hat we can do som et hing about .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e011 [ s] : It ’s m ost ly a quest ion of user int erface .
m e011 [ qw] : How do we [ disfm arker] how do we specify which ones
are on ?
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fg|s^ bu] : Yeah , so we don’t st ore any of our audio form at s
com pressed in any way
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g] : do we ?
m e011 [ s.%−−] : So t hese large sect ions when you guys aren’t t alking
[ disfm arker]
m e025 [ h] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s^ cs] : Probably , we could [ disfm arker] we could probably just
run Short en on t hem or som et hing and it will get a big win .
m e025 [ s.%−] : I t hink t hat ’s a good [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qw^ br] : Run what on t hose ?
m e025 [ s] : Short en .
m e025 [ s^ e] : Tony Robinson ’s [ pause] uh lossless com pression t hing
.
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ qw] : What ’s it do ?
m e025 [ h|s.%−−] : Um , it [ disfm arker] [ pause] it does [ pause] AR
[ pause] m odeling
m e025 [ s] : and so it looks at a sect ion , [ pause] it runs an AR m odel
t o sort of r w t o whit en it [ pause] and t hen quant izes [ pause] t he
residual [ pause] wit h a nice [ disfm arker] wit h t he t hree bit s it can get
away wit h .
m e025 [ s] : Som et hing like t hat .
m e025 [ s] : So I t hink it [ disfm arker] On [ disfm arker] on each block it ’ll
[ disfm arker] [ pause] it ’ll com press you know if t here ’s load on in any
range it ’ll use rat io bit s .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e025 [ s] : I t hink it does t hat .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , so , P Z
m e025 [ s^ df.%−−] : Yeah , well .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .

m e011 [ s^ cs] : Yeah , it ’s som et hing t hat [ disfm arker] t hat we
definit ely need t o look at wit h t his .
m e011 [ s] : Maybe we shouldn’t ’ve [ pause] subsam pled it down t o
six t een bit s [ pause] for our first t ry .
m e025 [ fg|s] : Well , it ’s OK ,
m e025 [ s^ df] : it ’s only t he first t ry .
m e025 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] what I ’m t hinking is um [ pause] obviously we
can do t he [ disfm arker] we can [ disfm arker] we can choose any
six t een bit s from t he t went y four , so we can just have different gain
t hings t hat we use [ pause] you know per channel .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : Yeah , so we m ight wanna see if m aybe t he low sixt een
bit s on t he P Z Ms are bet t er t han t he m iddle [ pause] sixt een bit s .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s] : I t hink [ disfm arker] [ pause] probably t he bot t om four bit s
are not any good ,
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Regardless , yeah .
m e025 [ qy^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e025 [ s] : Alt hough you know it claim s t hey are .
m e025 [ %−] : But probably t he [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : W I was just not icing on t he [ disfm arker] on t he
[ disfm arker] t here ’s a view m et er , soft ware view m et er and t he PZM
gain is real low .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ cs] : Yeah , so I t hink init ially we should t ake up m ore
space unt il we ’ve analyzed t his and get a bet t er sense of it
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s^ df] : because [ pause] uh we don I m ean we ’re not t alking
about fort y or fift y hours at t his point
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : we ’re t alking about [ pause] a half hour of [ disfm arker] of
speech
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and so [ pause] uh we should look at t his carefully
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Yeah , I was [ pause] int erest ed when I saw t he t went y −
four on t here .
m e025 [ s^ ba] : Oh , yeah !
m e013 [ s] : Wow , I m ean t hat ’s probably eight bit s of noise .
m e025 [ s^ ba^ r] : Oh yeah !
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , t hat ’s right .
m e011 [ s^ na] : We ’ve got lot s of bit s of noise .
m e025 [ s^ ba] : These t heories t hings are pret t y am azing .

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s.%−] : And And t here ’s help [ disfm arker] help t hey seem
[ disfm arker] t hey seem good t hough t hey seem t o be
m e013 [ s] : It ’s som e sort of ov ersam pling t hing I im agine ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e013 [ qy] : Didn’t we already get t hat ?
m e025 [ s^ no.%] : Oh , God knows .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah , yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Cuz you [ disfm arker] you can’t have [ pause] uh com ponent
t olerances t hat are [ pause] uh [ pause] sixt een m illion [ disfm arker]
one in six t een m illion part s ,
m e025 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ fh] : so .
m e025 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ fg|s^ t c] : Right t he ot her [ disfm arker] ot her t hing [ pause]
anot her issue is just get t ing a sound card up here .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : You know , I assum ed t hat we could just put a sound
blast er in if we want sound out put .
m e025 [ s] : That [ disfm arker] t hat card [ disfm arker] t hat m achine ’s
got sound [ disfm arker] They ’v e got a sound blast er built int o it .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh , it ’s just not working .
m e025 [ s] : I just [ disfm arker] I just disabled it cuz I want ed t o find out
[ pause] how well t he [ pause] sound infrast ruct ure would deal wit h
bot h at once
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e025 [ s] : but I t hink yeah , t hat ’s , uh [ disfm arker] [ pause] probably
it will be fine .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , t hat way we don’t [ disfm arker] we can’t list en t o it
[ pause] on t his m achine .
m e013 [ %−] : I ’m s
m e025 [ %−] : There ’s no ,
m e013 [ s^ fe] : Oh !
m e025 [ s^ df] : For a couple of reasons .
m e025 [ s] : Well , but t he @ @ [ disfm arker] [ pause] There are t wo
way s we could list en t o it .
m e025 [ s] : There ’s a sound [ disfm arker] t here ’s act ually sound
out put built int o t his t hing .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s] : But t he driver [ disfm arker] I haven’t [ disfm arker] t he driver
m ay not support it y et .
m e025 [ s] : And t hen t here ’s also t he sound or t he sound card built in
.
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
m e025 [ s] : But I don’t know how t o [ disfm arker] I don’t know how t he
[ pause] operat ing syst em would like having t wo sound cards .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : But we can FTP st uff over ,

m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : So [ pause] it ’s connect ed .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : And we ’ve looked at it so we know it ’s working .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , you can see t he lit t le squiggles , and it looks
like speech [ pause] so
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : You just can’t list en .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ h] : Um .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : One suggest ion I hav e is t hat um I t hink t his
[ disfm arker] [ pause] m aybe we should just read som e m ore
[ disfm arker] you m ade m ore of t hese ,
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g] : right ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : I t hink we should read som e m ore because
[ disfm arker] because t his is very f
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : we [ disfm arker] [ pause] we need t o [ disfm arker] t o work
t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he uh [ disfm arker] t he t alkers m ore
m e013 [ s^ df] : because we ’re not gonna have t hat m any m eet ings
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : and t his is a pret t y t iny am ount of dat a .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−] : So m aybe we should do anot her [ pause] num ber
list and [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg|s] : Well right I [ disfm arker] I just did t en per page I could
easily do t went y per page .
m e011 [ s^ df] : It ’s just a quest ion of uh [ pause] of how m uch uh
annoy ance I want ed t o put uh people going t o m eet ings t hrough .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ by] : Well t his is us .
m e013 [ s] : We ’ll have a fair am ount of annoyance
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : y eah I t hink
m e013 [ fh] : uh .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : So , can we do [ disfm arker] we do anot her set ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m e013 [ qy ^ t c.%−−] : Are we [ disfm arker] are we [ disfm arker] are we
[ disfm arker] sort of [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m e013 [ s^ bs.%−] : we t alked out about what we ’re [ disfm arker]

m e025 [ s^ ar|s] : Well no , OK , t he quest ion I st ill have about what we
’re going t o do is what is [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker] eh
[ disfm arker] OK , so we can get t he equipm ent set up so t hat basically
we ’re in a sit uat ion where we can [ disfm arker] [ pause] wit h , you know
, t en m inut es of preparat ion , we can bring [ pause] nine people in
here and do a m ult i channel recording .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e025 [ fh] : Um .
m e025 [ qy^ rt ] : What are [ disfm arker] wh When are we [ disfm arker]
Are we going t o do t hat ?
m e025 [ qw] : Who are t hey going t o be ?
m e025 [ qw] : What m eet ings are we going t o record ?
m e011 [ s] : Us , t o begin wit h .
m e025 [ qw] : So which [ disfm arker] which m eet ings [ disfm arker] What
m eet ings do we hav e ?
m e011 [ s] : I t hink t hat ’s t he int ent ion .
m e025 [ qr] : I m ean like " us " being t he Meet ing Recorder people or "
us " being any t hing t hat speech [ pause] local does .
m e011 [ s] : Well , I t hink [ disfm arker] [ pause] I t hink , um , cert ainly us
, Meet ing Recorder .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fh|s] : Um , us ot her groups .
m e011 [ s] : It just depends on how m any m eet ings we ’re [ disfm arker]
we ’re having .
m e011 [ fh] : Um .
m e011 [ s] : Jerry also said it would be [ disfm arker] he would be willing
t o hav e his group , som e of t he AI m eet ings do it as well .
m e025 [ s^ cs] : And we should hav e like [ disfm arker] we should have
Decoder m eet ings and st uff .
m e011 [ fh] : And uh
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Exact ly exact ly .
m e011 [ s] : I t hink t here are enough [ pause] incident al m eet ings for
us t o [ disfm arker] t o do t his .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : And if [ pause] we can get it set up so it is conv enient
enough , um , t hen you can just do spont aneous m eet ings as well .
m e025 [ fg|s] : Yeah , I m ean t hat ’s t he t hing .
m e025 [ %−] : It ’s OK t o g
m e025 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : Which I ’m int erest ed in .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , t hat ’s one of t he t hings , t he whole reason I want
a PDA as opposed t o a wired room is for spont aneous m eet ings .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ b] : Right .
m e025 [ s] : Well , we ’ve got t o m ake it really really easy t o st art it
going t hen in t hat case .

m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e025 [ s] : Cuz t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he real [ pause] goal .
m e011 [ b] : That ’s right .
m e011 [ s] : That ’s why I put t en on here inst ead of t hirt y or fort y or

m e025 [ b] : Right .
m e025 [ s] : But I m ean if we [ disfm arker] if we want [ pause] Jerry ’s
group t o [ pause] use it t hen we probably @ @ won’t ask t hem t o read
any num bers ,
m e025 [ qy^ d^ g] : right ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e025 [ %] : Cuz .
m e011 [ s^ arp] : Well , I [ disfm arker] I bet t hey would be willing t o do it
t he first few t im es , just for t he novelt y .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : I t hink t hey would .
m e013 [ s] : And also he ’s [ disfm arker] he ’s [ disfm arker] he ’s got
[ pause] at least one wom an .
m e025 [ s^ ba] : That ’s great .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Oh , t hat ’s a good point !
m e025 [ b.%] : I know .
m e013 [ s] : And we ’re [ disfm arker] we have a lit t le problem of [ pause]
no wom en ,
m e011 [ s] : Boy , t hat ’s abs I had nev er [ disfm arker] I hadn’t even
t hought about t hat .
m e025 [ s.%] : I know , it ’s a disast er .
m e013 [ s.%−] : Yeah , well , when L when Liz uh Shriberg st art s com ing ,
t hen t here ’s anot her wom an alt hough she [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ fe] : Oh , m an !
m e025 [ s^ bd] : It ’s alright
m e025 [ s] : she doesn’t m ind as long as we don’t video her ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e013 [ h|s^ aa] : Ah , t hat ’s right .
m e013 [ s^ t c] : That was it .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : May be we should have t he reading group here and
force Jane t o com e .
m e025 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s^ cs^ na.%−−] : No , well , act ually we could have Jane uh
[ disfm arker] Jane ’s int erest ed and curious about t his st uff so she
could at t end one of [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : probably not t he decoder m eet ing but som e of t he
ot her st uff she [ pause] would be int erest ed enough and have her read
[ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s^ cs] : We could [ disfm arker] we could have t he reading
group in here .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , I m ean it ’s a different st yle .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ %−−] : I m ean .
m e011 [ s] : But I t hink t hat ’s alright .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , it ’s great .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fg|s] : Um , [ pause] [ vocalsound] we were joking about having

m e011 [ fh|s^ t c] : Um , [ pause] I had anot her quest ion briefly about
t ranscript ion .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ qr^ rt ] : So are we going get an ex t ernal service or are we
gonna do it ?
m e011 [ qw] : I m ean who ’s gonna [ pause] generat e t he t ranscript s ?
m e013 [ h|s] : Um I t hink t hat one of t he neat t hings about having t his
lit t le pilot t hing from t oday is we should t ry it a couple different ways ,
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : so we should [ pause] t ry t o do it int ernally ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : m ay be ask [ disfm arker] ask Jane if we could get her t o
do it or [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker] or hav e her [ pause] supervise a
linguist ics st udent or som ebody
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and uh see how long it t akes , and you know , m ult iply
out t he cost ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and t hen send [ disfm arker] send t he sam e t hing out ,
or m ay be split it in halves or som et hing [ disfm arker] som et hing like
t hat t o a [ disfm arker] t o an out side service
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and uh see what t hat cost s and how m uch hassle t hat
is .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen we can assess it .
m e011 [ s^ arp] : Yeah , t he [ disfm arker] t he problem of course is t hat
it ’s [ pause] y ou know , in [ disfm arker] in t his m eet ing it ’s t hree four
five six seven eight , it ’s nine t ranscript s , [ pause] pot ent ially .
m e025 [ s^ arp] : Well , Except t hat you wouldn’t t ranscribe t hem all
indiv idually ,
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e025 [ qy^ d^ g] : right ?

m e025 [ s] : You would send [ disfm arker] I m ean , [ pause] uh a
t ranscriber is used [ disfm arker] I m ean , I don’t know , assum e
[ disfm arker] presum ably a t ranscriber [ pause] t ranscribes a single
m eet ing ,
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e025 [ qy^ d^ g] : right ?
m e025 [ s] : And so t hey [ disfm arker] t hey just have t o [ pause] indicat e
t hat t he [ pause] speaker changes .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : This was [ disfm arker] t his was t he point of having near
zero skew .
m e025 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : So you just pick one , wit h t he best sounding one , and
giv e it t o som ebody and t hey t ranscribe it .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Oh , you ’re right , yeah , yeah , yeah .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : So [ pause] t he only t hing we ’ll have t o be careful wit h
is t hat t hey ’re [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qw] : well , what are t hey list ening t o ?
m e025 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so t hey [ disfm arker] t hey ’re gonna
[ disfm arker] t hey ’re gonna have t o m ake speaker assignm ent s
[ pause] or som et hing like t his .
m e011 [ s^ bk^ m ] : They ’re going t o have t o m ake speaker
assignm ent s ,
m e011 [ qw] : and wh and which recording are t hey gonna list en t o ?
m e025 [ s] : For one of [ disfm arker] one of @ @ .
m e025 [ s^ cs] : Or we could m ix [ disfm arker] we could m ix t he
[ disfm arker] t he headset m ikes , you know , just t o m ake a single high
q high qualit y [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e025 [ s^ cs] : and we could do [ disfm arker] and we could do all kinds
of weird t hings like having you know squelch so t hat [ pause] you only ,
y ou know [ disfm arker] you only [ disfm arker] you cut it out when t here
’s no energy .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Oh , t hat would be int erest ing .
m e025 [ s] : So you don’t @ @ noise .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah , you could do fancy t hings , but it seem s like t hat ’s
enough .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .

m e025 [ s] : I m ean t here ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] If we
[ disfm arker] if we do som et hing which is have a lit t le bit of hum an input
t o get t he words t hen we can [ pause] leverage t hat a lot by som e
clev er cross t hing t o figure out which channel t hey really belong t o and
st uff like t his , probably .
m e011 [ b] : OK .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ fg] : Yet .
m e011 [ s] : So t hat [ disfm arker] I m ean , t hat ’s one chunk of work and
just segm ent ing for t his is gonna be anot her chunk of work .
m e011 [ fh] : Um .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] Yeah .
m e025 [ s] : As m uch work as y ou want .
m e013 [ b|s^ no] : Yeah But uh I don’t know .
m e013 [ s] : This m eet ing , so , say it ’s m aybe going t o be a half hour
or som et hing ,
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] [ pause] and uh we ’ve heard est im at es
ranging bet ween t en and t went y [ pause] t im es uh real t im e t o do t his
kind of t ranscript ion
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : um [ pause] so you know in [ disfm arker] in principle t hen
it ’ll t ake som ebody a day for som ebody t o deal wit h t his .
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e025 [ s^ fe] : Wow .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And uh we ’ll see [ pause] which one of t hose seem s
closest t o right
m e013 [ s] : and if t hey [ disfm arker] [ pause] ram ped up , if t owards t he
end it was fast er y ou know , get som e sort of sense from t hem uh from
whoev er does it
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s] : and um t hen uh like I say , check it out wit h an ext ernal
serv ice and see [ pause] if it ’s fast er , cheaper , bet t er , worse ,
what ev er .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : Then we ’ll go from t here .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ qh^ rt ] : Yeah , one of t he t hings I was t hinking wit h t ranscript
is t hat if we t ake t he near field and [ pause] we do an init ial [ pause]
recognit ion pass , is it easier for a t ranscriber t o correct a t ranscript ,
if t he [ pause] near field m ike does a reasonably good job ?
m e025 [ b] : Hm m .
m e011 [ s] : I bet it isn’t , unless it ’s really close t o right .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ %−−] : I have [ disfm arker] just because it ’s such an un

m e025 [ s] : The t ranscribing is sort of som et hing I can im agine doing ,
whereas having t his dist ract ion of having sort of som et hing t hat looks
like it m ight be right but has got som e [ com m ent ] very wrong bit s in is
sort of a less [ disfm arker] less easy t hing t o do .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : Som e errors , yeah .
m e013 [ s^ no^ rt ] : I don’t know .
m e013 [ s^ no] : I do I don’t know t he answer t o t hat .
m e025 [ s.%−−] : I ’m sure t he professional t ranscribers obviously don’t
have any use for [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ no^ rt ] : I don’t know .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah Yeah , t hat ’s t rue ,
m e013 [ s^ bu] : Well , I m ean t here ’s t his Cyber Transcriber service ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e025 [ s^ aa^ r] : t hat ’s t rue .
m e013 [ s] : And at least supposedly t he way t hey work is by feeding
t hem what is t he out put of t he recognizer .
m e025 [ b|s^ e] : Yeah , by fixing up [ pause] t ranscript s .
