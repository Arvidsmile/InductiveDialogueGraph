m e010 [ z] : OK , so Eva , co uh [ disfm arker] could you read your
num bers ?
fn050 [ z] : Go ahead and read .
m e010 [ z] : Yeah .
fn050 [ z] : OK .
m n015 [ b] : Alright .
m e010 [ s^ co] : Yeah , let ’s get st art ed .
m e010 [ h|s] : Um [ disfm arker] Hopefully Nancy will com e ,
m e010 [ s] : if not , she won’t .
m e045 [ fg|qy.%−−] : Uh , Robert , do you uh have any way t o t urn off
y our uh screensaver on t here so t hat it ’s not going off every
[ disfm arker] uh ,
m e045 [ s.%−] : it seem s t o have about at t wo m inut e [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ fg|s] : Yeah , I ’ve [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] it
’s not t hat I didn’t t ry .
m e045 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : and um I [ disfm arker] I t old it t o st ay on forever and ever ,
but if it ’s not plugged in it just doesn’t obey m y com m ands .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : It has a m ind .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Got it .
fe046 [ s^ e] : Want s t o conserve .
m n015 [ s] : But I I just [ disfm arker] You know , sort of keep on wiggling
.
m e045 [ s^ bk.x] : Yeah , OK .
m n015 [ s] : But uh [ disfm arker] we ’ll just be m m working on it at
int ensit y so it doesn’t happen .
m n015 [ b] : We ’ll see .
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ] : Should we plunge right int o it ?
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ qy .%−−] : So , would you like t o [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : I t hink so .
m n015 [ s] : So what I ’ve t ried t o do here is list all t he decision nodes
t hat we have ident ified on t his [ pause] side .
m n015 [ s] : Com m ent ed and [ disfm arker] what t hey ’re about and sort
of [ disfm arker] t he propert ies we m ay um give t hem .
m n015 [ s] : And here are t he uh [ disfm arker] t asks t o be im plem ent ed
v ia our dat a collect ion .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : So all of t hese t asks [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : The reading is out of t hese t asks m ore or less im ply t hat
t he user want s t o go t here , som et im e or t he ot her .
m n015 [ s] : And analogously for exam ple , here we have our EVA um
[ disfm arker] int ent ion .
m n015 [ s] : And t hese are t he dat a t asks where w we can assum e t he
person would like t o ent er , view or just approach t he t hing .
m n015 [ s] : Analogously t he sam e on t he object inform at ion

m n015 [ s] : we can see t hat , you know , we have sort of creat ed
t hese t asks before we cam e up wit h our decision nodes
m n015 [ s] : so t here ’s a lot of t hings where we have no analogous
t asks , and [ pause] t hat m ay or m ay not be a problem .
m n015 [ s] : We can change t he t asks slight ly if we feel t hat we should
have dat a for e sort of for every decision node
m n015 [ s] : so [ disfm arker] t rying t o im um [ disfm arker] im plant t he
int ent ion of going t o a place now , going t o a place lat er on t he sam e
t our ,
m n015 [ s] : or t rying t o plant t he int ent ion of going som et im e on t he
next t our , or t he next day or whenever .
m e010 [ b] : Right , right .
m n015 [ s] : But I t hink t hat m ight be overdoing it a lit t le .
m e010 [ b] : So [ disfm arker] Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ t ] : So let m e pop up a level .
m e010 [ s] : And uh s s m ake sure t hat we ’re all orient ed t he sam e .
m e010 [ s^ t ] : So What we ’re gonna do t oday is t wo relat ed t hings .
m e010 [ fh|s] : Uh one of t hem is t o work on t he sem ant ics of t he belief
− net which is going t o be t he m ain inference engine for t hi t he syst em
uh m aking decisions .
m e010 [ s] : And decisions are going t o t urn out t o be param et er
choices for calls on ot her m odules .
m e010 [ s] : so f t he nat ural language underst anding t hing is uh , we
t hink gonna only hav e t o choose param et ers , but You know , a fairly
large set of param et ers .
m e010 [ s] : So t o do t hat , we need t o do t wo t hings .
m e010 [ s] : One of which is figure out what all t he choices are , which
we ’v e done a fair am ount .
m e010 [ s] : Then we need t o figure out what influences it s choices
m e010 [ s] : and finally we have t o do som e t echnical work on t he
act ual belief relat ions and presum ably est im at es of t he probabilit ies
and st uff .
m e010 [ s] : But we aren’t gonna do t he probabilit y st uff t oday .
m e010 [ s] : Technical st uff we ’ll do [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker]
anot her day .
m e010 [ s] : Probably next week .
m e010 [ s] : But we are gonna worry about all t he decisions and t he
t hings t hat pert t hat cont ribut e t o t hem .
m e010 [ s] : And we ’re also , sort of uh in t he sam e process , going t o
work wit h Fey on what t here should be in t he dialogues .
m e010 [ s] : So One of t he s st eps t hat ’s com ing up real soon is t o
act ually get subject s uh [ disfm arker] in here , and have t hem act ually
record like t his .
m e010 [ s] : Uh record dialogues m ore or less .
m e010 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] depending on what Fey sort of provokes
t hem t o say , we ’ll get inform at ion on different t hings .

m e010 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ bu] : Well how people phrase different int ent ions m ore or
less ,
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Fo − v yeah people wit h t he [ disfm arker] phrase t hem
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g] : huh ?
m e010 [ s] : and so [ disfm arker] Uh for , you know , Keit h and people
worrying about what const ruct ions people use , uh [ disfm arker] we
have som e i we hav e som e ways t o affect t hat by t he way t he
dialogues go .
m e010 [ s] : So what Robert kindly did , is t o lay out a t able of t he kinds
of uh [ pause] t hings t hat [ disfm arker] t hat m ight com e up ,
m e010 [ s] : and , t he kinds of decisions .
m e010 [ s] : So t he uh [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] on t he left are
decision nodes , and discreet values .
m e010 [ s] : So if [ disfm arker] if we ’re right , you can get by wit h um
just t his m iddle colum n wort h of decisions ,
m e010 [ s] : and it ’s not all t hat m any , and it ’s perfect ly feasible
t echnically t o build belief − net s t hat will do t hat .
m e010 [ s] : And he has a handout .
m n015 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : Maybe it was t oo fast plunging in t here , because j we
have t wo updat es .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : Um y ou can look at t his if you want ,
m n015 [ s] : t hese are what our subject ’s going t o have t o fill out .
m n015 [ s] : Any com m ent s I can [ disfm arker] can st ill be m ade and t he
changes will be put in correspondingly .
fe046 [ b] : m [ v ocalsound] [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound]
[ v ocalsound] [ v ocalsound] Yes .
m n015 [ s] : Let m e sum m arize in t wo sent ences ,
m n015 [ s.x ] : m ainly for Eva ’s benefit , who probably has not heard
about t he dat a collect ion , at all .
fn050 [ b.x] : OK .
m n015 [ qy^ bu^ rt ] : Or have y ou heard about it ?
fn050 [ s^ ar] : Not t hat m uch
m n015 [ s^ bk^ m ] : No .
fn050 [ %−−] : y ou didn’t .
m n015 [ s] : OK . We were gonna put t his in front of people .
m n015 [ s] : They give us som e inform at ion on t hem selves .
fn050 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : Then [ disfm arker] t hen t hey will read uh [ disfm arker] a
t ask where lot s of Germ an words are sort of t hrown in bet ween .
m n015 [ s] : And um [ disfm arker] and t hey have t o read isolat ed proper
nam es
m n015 [ s.%−] : And t hese change [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−] : S I don’t see a release

m n015 [ s] : No , t his is not t he release form .
m n015 [ s^ e] : This is t he speaker inform at ion form .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Got it .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK , fine .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : The release form is over t here in t hat box .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Alright , fair enough .
m n015 [ s] : And um [ disfm arker] And t hen t hey gonna have t o f um um
choose from one of t hese t asks , which are list ed here .
m n015 [ s] : They [ disfm arker] t hey pick a couple ,
m n015 [ s] : say t hree [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] uh six as a m at t er
of fact .
m n015 [ s] : Six different t hings t hey sort of t hink t hey would do if t hey
were in Heidelberg or t raveling som eplace [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ h|s] : and um [ disfm arker] and t hey have a m ap .
m e045 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ s] : Like t his .
m n015 [ s] : Very sket chy , sim plified m ap .
m n015 [ s] : And t hey can t ake not es on t hat m ap .
m n015 [ s^ j] : And t hen t hey call t his com put er syst em t hat works
perfect ly , and underst ands everyt hing .
fn050 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ fh] : And um [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : The com p Yeah , t he com put er syst em sit s right in front of
y ou ,
m e045 [ s^ j] : This is a fict ional syst em obviously ,
m e045 [ qy ^ d^ g] : huh .
m n015 [ s^ e] : t hat ’s Fey .
fe046 [ s^ j] : I ’v e [ disfm arker] I underst and ev eryt hing .
m e010 [ s^ j] : And she does know everyt hing .
fe046 [ s^ aa] : Yes I do .
m n015 [ s] : And she has a way of m aking t his m achine t alk .
m n015 [ s] : So she can copy sent ences int o a window , or t ype really
fast
m n015 [ s] : and t his m achine will use speech synt hesis t o produce
t hat .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : So if you ask " How do I get t o t he cast le " t hen a m s
sev eral seconds lat er it ’ll com e out of here " In order t o get t o t he
cast le y ou do [ disfm arker] "
m n015 [ qy ^ f^ rt ] : OK ?
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : And um [ disfm arker] And t hen aft er t hree t asks t he syst em
breaks down .
m n015 [ s] : And Fey com es on t he phone as a hum an operat or .
m n015 [ s] : And say s " Sorry t he syst em broke down but let ’s cont inue
."

m n015 [ s] : And we sort of get t he idea what people do when t hey s
t hink t hey speak t o a m achine and what people say when t hey t hink
t hey speak t o a hum an , or know , or assum e t hey speak t o a hum an .
fn050 [ b] : OK .
fn050 [ b] : Huh .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ bs] : That ’s t he dat a collect ion .
m n015 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : And um [ disfm arker] And Fey has som e t hirt y
subject s lined up ?
m n015 [ %−] : Som et hing ?
fe046 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe046 [ s] : And m ore and m ore every day .
m n015 [ s] : And um [ disfm arker] And t hey ’re [ disfm arker] r ready uh
[ disfm arker] t o roll .
m n015 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : And we ’re gonna st art t om orrow at t hree ?
m n015 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : four ?
m n015 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : one ?
fe046 [ s^ rt .%−−] : Tom orrow ,
fe046 [ s^ no] : well we don’t know for sure .
fe046 [ s^ e] : Because we don’t know whet her t hat person is com ing or
not ,
m n015 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe046 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : Around four − ish .
m n015 [ s] : And um we ’re st ill l looking for a room on t he sixt h floor
because t hey st ole away t hat conference room . Um [ disfm arker]
behind our backs .
m n015 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : Well , t here are t hese [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] uh
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : oh , I see , we have t o [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : Yeah , it ’s t ricky .
m e010 [ s] : We ’ll [ disfm arker] let ’s [ disfm arker] let [ disfm arker] we ’ll
do t hat off − line , OK .
m n015 [ s] : Yeah , but I [ disfm arker] i i it ’s happening .
m n015 [ s] : Dav id and [ disfm arker] and Jane and [ disfm arker] and Lila
are working on t hat as we speak .
m e010 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ bs] : That was t he uh [ disfm arker] t he dat a collect ion in a
nut shell .
m n015 [ h|s.%−−] : And um [ disfm arker] I can report a [ disfm arker] so I
did t his but I also t ried t o do t his [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ t 1.%−−] : so if I click on here ,
m n015 [ qy ^ t 1] : Isn’t t his wonderful ?

m n015 [ s] : we get t o t he uh [ disfm arker] uh belief − net just focusing
on [ disfm arker] on t he g Go − t here node .
m n015 [ s] : uh [ disfm arker] Analogously t his would be sort of t he
reason node and t he t im ing node and so fort h .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : And what w what happened is t hat um design − wise I ’d
sort of n not iced t hat we can [ disfm arker] we st ill get a lot of errors
from a lot of point s t o one of t hese sub Go − t here User Go − t here
Sit uat ion nodes .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : So I cam e up wit h a couple of addit ional nodes here
where um
m n015 [ s] : whet her t he user is t hrift y or not , and what his budget is
current ly like , is going t o result in som e financial st at e of t he user .
m n015 [ qh] : How m uch will he [ disfm arker] is he willing t o spend ?
m n015 [ s^ bsc] : Or can spend .
m n015 [ s] : Being t he sam e at t his [ disfm arker] just t he m oney
av ailable , which m ay influence us , whet her he want s t o go t here
m n015 [ s^ e.%−−] : if it is [ disfm arker] you know [ disfm arker] charging
t ons of dollars for adm ission or it s gonna g cost a lot of t e
m n015 [ s] : what ev er .
m n015 [ s^ j] : Twent y − t wo m illion t o fly t o Int ernat ional Space St at ion ,
y ou know .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s] : just [ disfm arker] Not all people can do t hat .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : So , and t his act ually t urned out t o be pret t y key ,
because having specified sort of t hese [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker]
t his [ disfm arker] t his [ disfm arker] int erm ediat e level Um and sort of
not icing t hat ev ery t hing t hat happens here [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ t 1] : let ’s go t o our favorit e endpoint one
m n015 [ s.%−−] : is again m ore or less [ disfm arker] we have [ disfm arker]
um [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : t hen t he sit uat ion nodes cont ribut ing t o t he [ disfm arker]
t he endpoint sit uat ion node , which cont ribut es t o t he endpoint and
so fort h .
m n015 [ s] : um [ disfm arker] I can now sort of draw st raight lines from
t hese t o here , m eaning it g of course goes where t he sub − S
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : everyt hing t hat com es from sit uat ion , everyt hing t hat
com es from user goes wit h t he sub − U ,
m n015 [ s] : and what ever we specify for t he so − called " Keit h node " ,
or t he discourse , what com es from t he [ disfm arker] um [ disfm arker]
parser , const ruct ion parser , um will cont ribut e t o t he D and t he
ont ology t o t he sub − O node .

m n015 [ fh|s] : And um one just s sort of has t o wat ch which
[ disfm arker] also final decision node so it doesn’t m ake sense
[ disfm arker] t t o figure out whet her he want s t o ent er , view or
approach an object if he never want s t o go t here in t he first place .
m n015 [ s] : But t his m akes t he design t hing fairly sim ple .
m n015 [ fh|s] : And um now all w t hat ’s left t o do t hen is t he CPG ’s ,
t he condit ional probabilit ies , for t he likelihood of a person having
enough m oney , act ually want ing t o go a place if it cost s , you know
t his or t hat .
m n015 [ fh|s] : And um [ disfm arker] OK .
m n015 [ s] : and once um Bhaskara has finished his classwork t hat ’s
where we ’re gonna end up doing .
m n015 [ s] : You get involved in t hat process t oo .
m n015 [ fh|qh] : And um [ disfm arker] And for now uh t he [ disfm arker]
t he quest ion is " How m uch of t hese decisions do we want t o build in
ex plicit ly int o our dat a collect ion ? "
m n015 [ fh|s.%−−] : So [ disfm arker] Um , one could [ disfm arker] sort of
[ disfm arker] t hink of [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : you know we could call t he z see or [ disfm arker] you know ,
people who visit t he zoo
m n015 [ s] : we could s call it " Visit t he zoo t om orrow " ,
m n015 [ s] : so we have an int ent ion of seeing som et hing , but not now
[ disfm arker] but lat er .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e010 [ fg|s] : Yeah , so [ disfm arker] let ’s s uh s see I t h I t hink t hat
from one point of view , Uh , um , all t hese places are t he sam e ,
m e010 [ s] : so t hat d d That , um [ disfm arker] in t erm s of t he
linguist ics and st uff , t here m ay be a few different kinds of places ,
m e010 [ s] : so I t h i it seem s t o m e t hat We ought t o decide you know ,
what t hings are k are act ually going t o m at t er t o us .
m e010 [ fh|s] : And um , so t he zoo , and t he universit y and t he cast le ,
et cet era . Um are all big − ish t hings t hat um [ disfm arker] you know
[ disfm arker] hav e different part s t o t hem , and one of t hem m ight be
fine .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m , hm m .
m e010 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ fg|s^ df] : Yeah [ disfm arker] The [ disfm arker] t he reason why
we did it t hat way , as a [ disfm arker] as a rem inder , is uh [ disfm arker]
no person is gonna do all of t hem .
m n015 [ s] : They ’re just gonna select u um , according t o t heir
preferences .
m e010 [ fg] : Yeah , yeah .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : " Ah , yeah , I usually visit zoos , or I usually visit cast les
, or I usually [ disfm arker] "

m n015 [ s] : And t hen you pick t hat one .
m e010 [ s^ bk|fg] : Right , no no ,
m e010 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] but s t h point is t o [ disfm arker] t o y t o
[ disfm arker] build a syst em t hat ’s got everyt hing in it t hat m ight
happen y ou do one t hing .
fe046 [ s^ 2^ bu^ rt ] : They ’re redundant .
m e010 [ s] : T t o build a syst em t hat um [ disfm arker] had t he m ost
dat a on a relat ively confined set of t hings , you do som et hing else .
m e010 [ s] : And t he speech people , for ex am ple , are gonna do bet t er
if t hey [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] t hings com e up uh [ disfm arker]
repeat edly .
m e010 [ s] : Now , of course , if ev ery body says exact ly t he sam e t hing
t hen it ’s not int erest ing .
m e010 [ s^ bs] : So , all I ’m saying is i t h t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s a
kind of quest ion of what we ’re t rying t t o accom plish .
m e010 [ h|s.%−−] : and [ disfm arker] I t hink m y t em pt at ion for t he dat a
gat hering would be t o uh ,
m e010 [ s] : y ou know [ disfm arker] And each person is only gonna do it
once ,
m e010 [ s] : so you don’t have t o worry about t hem being bored ,
m e010 [ s] : so if [ disfm arker] if it ’s one service , one luxury it em , you
know , one big − ish place , and so fort h and so on , um [ disfm arker]
t hen m y guess is t hat [ disfm arker] t hat t he dat a is going t o be easier
t o handle .
m e010 [ s^ df.x ] : Now of course you have t his I guess possible danger
t hat som ehow t here ’re cert ain const ruct ions t hat people use uh when
t alking about a m useum t hat t hey wouldn’t t alk about wit h a universit y
and st uff ,
m e010 [ s] : um [ disfm arker] but I guess I ’m [ disfm arker] I uh m m y
t em pt at ion is t o go for sim pler .
m e010 [ s^ e] : You know , less variat ion .
m e010 [ s^ no.%−−] : But I don’t know what ot her people t hink about t his
in t erm s of [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s.%−−] : So I don’t exact ly underst and [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s] : like I I [ disfm arker] I guess we ’re t rying t o [ disfm arker] lim it
t he det ail of our ont ology or t ypes of places t hat som eone could go ,
m e045 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e045 [ qw] : But who is it t hat has t o care about t his ,
m e045 [ qrr] : or what com ponent of t he syst em ?
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Oh ,
m e010 [ h|s] : well , uh [ disfm arker] t h I t hink t here are t wo places
where it com es up .
m e010 [ s] : One is uh [ disfm arker] in t he [ disfm arker] t h t hese people
who are gonna t ake t his and [ disfm arker] and t ry t o do speech wit h it .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e010 [ s] : uh [ disfm arker] Lot s of pronunciat ions of t h of t he sam e
t hing are going t o giv e you bet t er dat a t han l you know , a few
pronunciat ions of lot s m ore t hings .
m e045 [ b] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : That ’s one .
m e045 [ s^ bu] : So we would rat her just ask [ disfm arker] uh have a
bunch of people t alk about t he zoo ,
m e045 [ s^ bu] : uh and assum e t hat t hat will [ disfm arker] t hat t he
const ruct ions t hat t hey use t here will give us everyt hing we need t o
know about t hese sort of zoo , cast le , what ever t ype t hings , t hese
bigger places .
m e010 [ s^ 2] : Bigger [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ aa|s.%−] : Y yeah t hi well t his is a quest ion for [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s] : And t hat way you get t he speech dat a of people saying "
zoo " ov er and ov er again or what ever t oo .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : So t his is a quest ion for you ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : and , you know , if we [ disfm arker] if we do , and we
probably will , act ually t ry t o uh build a prot ot ype , uh
m e010 [ s] : probably we could get by wit h t he prot ot ype only handling
a few of t hem any way .
m e010 [ fh] : So , Um [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : Yeah , t he t his was sort of [ disfm arker] t hese are all
different sort of act ivit ies .
m n015 [ s] : Um But I t hink y I [ disfm arker] I got t he point and I t hink I
like it .
m n015 [ s] : We can do [ disfm arker] put t hem in a m ore hierarchical
fashion .
m n015 [ s] : So , " Go t o place " and t hen give t hem a choice ,
m n015 [ s] : y ou know eit her t hey ’re t he sym phony t ype or opera t ype
or t he t ourist sit e guide t ype or t he night club disco t ype person and
t hey say " yeah t his is [ disfm arker] on t hat " go t o big − ish place " ,
m n015 [ s] : t his is what I would do . "
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : And t hen we have t he " Fix " t hing , and t hen m aybe " Do
som et hing t he ot her day " t hing ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : so . My quest ion is [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : I guess , t o som e ext ent , we should [ disfm arker] y we just
have t o t ry it out and see if it works .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : It would be challenging , in [ disfm arker] in a sense , t o
t ry t o m ake it so [ disfm arker] so com plex t hat t hey even really should
schedule , or t o plan it , uh , a m ore com plex t hing in t erm s of

m n015 [ h] : OK ,
m n015 [ s] : you know , t hey should get t he feeling t hat t here are
t hese s six t hings t hey have t o do
m n015 [ s] : and t hey sh can be done m ay be in t wo days .
m e010 [ fg] : Well [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ fg] : yeah .
m e010 [ s.%−] : Well I t hink t h t h
m n015 [ s] : So t hey m ake t hese decisions ,
m e010 [ fg] : yeah .
m n015 [ qh] : " Can I go t here t om orrow ? "
m n015 [ s] : or [ disfm arker] you know [ disfm arker] influences
m e010 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : Well , I t hink it ’s easy enough t o set t hat up if t hat ’s your
ex pect at ion .
m e010 [ s] : So , t he uh syst em could say , " Well , uh we ’d like t o
[ disfm arker] t o set up your program for t wo days in Heidelberg ,
m e010 [ s] : y ou know , let ’s first t hink about all t he t hings you m ight
like t o do .
m e010 [ s] : So t here [ disfm arker] t h i i in [ disfm arker] I m ean
[ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] I t h I [ disfm arker] I ’m sure t hat if t hat ’s
what y ou did t hen t hey would st art t elling you about t hat , and t hen
y ou could get int o um various t hings about ordering , if you want ed .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ arp] : Yeah , but I t hink t his is part of t he inst ruct or ’s job .
m n015 [ s] : And t hat can be done , sort of t o say , " OK now we ’ve
picked t hese six t asks . "
m n015 [ s] : " Now you have you can call t he syst em and you have t wo
days . "
m n015 [ s.%−−] : And t h w
m e010 [ s^ ar] : I ’m sorry .
m e010 [ s^ ar|s^ ng] : No , we have t o help [ disfm arker] we have t o
decide .
m e010 [ s^ e] : Fey will p carry out what ever we decide .
m e010 [ s] : But we have t o decide you know , what is t he appropriat e
scenario .
m e010 [ s] : That ’s what we ’re gonna t alk about t yeah .
m n015 [ b] : Yep , y ep .
m n036 [ s^ ng] : But t hese are t wo different scenarios ent irely .
m n036 [ s^ e] : I m ean , one is a planner [ disfm arker] The ot her , it kind
of giv e y ou inst ruct ions on t he spot
m n015 [ s^ aap|s^ ng] : Yeah , but t h t he [ disfm arker] I don’t
[ disfm arker] I ’m not really int erest ed in sort of " Phase planning "
capabilit ies .

m n015 [ qh] : But it ’s m ore t he [ disfm arker] how do people phrase
t hese planning request s ?
m n015 [ qy ] : So are we gonna m asquerade t he syst em as t his
[ disfm arker] as you said sim ple response syst em ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : " I have one quest ion I get one response " ,
m n015 [ qrr] : or should we allow for a cert ain level of com plexit y .
m n015 [ s] : And a I w t hink t he dat a would be nicer if we get t em poral
references .
m e010 [ qw] : Well , so Keit h , what do you t hink ?
m e045 [ h|s.%−−] : Well , um it seem s t hat [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s.%−−] : Yeah , I m ean ,
m e045 [ s] : off t he t op of m y head it kinda seem s like you would
probably just want , you know , richer dat a ,
m e045 [ s] : m ore com plex st uff going on ,
m e045 [ s] : people t rying t o do m ore com plex set s of t hings .
m e045 [ s] : I m ean [ pause] you know , if our goal is t o really sort of be
able t o handle a whole bunch of different st uff , t hen t hrowing harder
sit uat ions at people will get t hem t o do m ore linguist ic [ disfm arker]
m ore int erest ing linguist ic st uff .
m e045 [ s^ no] : But I m ean [ disfm arker] I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m not really
sure
m e045 [ s] : Uh , because I don’t fully underst and like what our choices
are of ways t o do t his here yet .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : I m ean w we have t est ed t his and a y
m n015 [ qy ^ rt .%−−] : have you heard [ disfm arker] list en t o t he f first t wo
or t h
m n015 [ s] : as a m at t er of fact t he second person is uh [ disfm arker] is
[ disfm arker] was faced wit h ex act ly t his kind of set up .
m n015 [ %−−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s] : I st art ed t o list en t o one and it was just like , um , uh , sort
of depressing .
m e045 [ s] : I t hought I ’d just sort of list en t o t he beginning part and
t he person was just sort of reading off her script or som et hing .
m e045 [ %−−] : And .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : That was t he first subject .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s] : First one wasn’t very good .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ %−] : So um , I [ disfm arker]
fe046 [ %−] : Alt hough [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ fg|s] : Um , it is [ disfm arker] already wit h t his it got pret t y
[ disfm arker] wit h t his set up and t hat part icular subject it got pret t y
com plex .

m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : May be [ disfm arker] I suggest we m ake som e fine
t uning of t hese , get [ disfm arker] sort of [ disfm arker] run t hrough t en
or so subject s
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : and t hen t ake a breat her ,
m n015 [ s] : and see whet her we wanna m ake it m ore com plex or not ,
depending on what [ disfm arker] what sort of result s we ’re get t ing .
m e045 [ b] : Right .
m e045 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s] : It [ disfm arker] In fact , um , I am just you know [ disfm arker]
t oday , next couple days gonna st art really diving int o t his dat a .
m e045 [ s] : I ’ve basically looked at one of t he files [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s.%−−] : you know one of t hese [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s] : l y y y you gave m e t hose dozens of files
m e045 [ s] : and I looked at one of t hem which was about t en
sent ences , found fift een , t went y different const ruct ion t ypes t hat we
would have t o look for and so on
m e045 [ s] : and like , " alright , well , let ’s st art here . "
m e045 [ s] : Um . So I haven’t really gone int o t he , you know
[ disfm arker] looked at all of t he st uff t hat ’s going on .
m e045 [ s.%−−] : So I don’t really [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s] : Right , I m ean , once I st art doing t hat I ’ll have m ore t o say
about t his kind of t hing .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s.%−] : And y and always [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : But well t h but you did say som et hing im port ant , which is
t hat um y ou can probably keep yourself fairly well occupied uh
[ disfm arker] wit h t he sim ple cases for quit e a while .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : Alt hough , obviously t h so [ disfm arker] so t hat sa s
does suggest t hat [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : Uh , now , I have looked at all t he dat a , and it ’s pre it ’s
act ually at least t o an am at eur , quit e redundant .
m e010 [ s] : That [ disfm arker] t hat it was [ disfm arker] it was very
st y lized , and quit e a lot of people said m ore or less t he sam e t hing .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah , Yeah .
m e045 [ s^ aap] : I um [ disfm arker] I did sort of scan it at first and
not iced t hat , and t hen looked in det ail at one of t hem .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s] : But y eah , yeah I not iced t hat , t oo .
m e010 [ s] : So , we [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] we wanna do m ore
t han t hat .
m n015 [ s] : And wit h t his we ’re get t ing m ore .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : No quest ion .

m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qy.%−−] : uh w do we wanna get going beyond m ore , which is
sort of t he [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ h|s.%−−] : Well , OK , so let ’s [ disfm arker] let ’s t ake
[ disfm arker] let ’s I [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : I t hink y our suggest ion is good , which is we ’ll do a b uh
[ disfm arker] a bat ch .
m e010 [ s^ f] : OK .
m e010 [ fh] : And , uh ,
m e010 [ qw] : Fey , How long is it gonna be t ill you have t en subject s ?
m e010 [ qy ^ rt ] : Couple days ?
m e010 [ qy ^ rt ] : Or t hr f a A week ?
m e010 [ s^ no.%−−] : Or [ disfm arker] I don’t [ disfm arker] I don’t have a
feel for t h
fe046 [ h|s] : Um [ disfm arker] I can [ disfm arker] Yeah , I m ean I s I t hink
can probably schedule t en people , uh , whenever .
m e010 [ s] : Well , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s up t o you ,
m e010 [ s^ e] : I m ean I j I [ disfm arker] uh e We don’t have any huge
t im e pressure .
m e010 [ %−] : It ’s just [ disfm arker] when you have t
fe046 [ qw^ bs] : How long will it be ?
fe046 [ h|s] : Um [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I would say m aybe t wo
weeks .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e010 [ s] : So let ’s do t his .
m e010 [ s^ co] : Let ’s plan nex t Monday , OK , t o have a review of what
we have so far .
m e010 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s.%−−] : This m eans audio , but [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ qy ^ br] : Huh ?
m n015 [ s] : no t ranscript ions of course ,
m e010 [ s^ aa] : No , we won’t have t he t ranscript ions ,
m n015 [ b] : yeah .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : but what we should be able t o do
m e010 [ s^ df] : and I don’t know if , Fey , if you will have t im e t o do t his
,
m e010 [ s^ cs] : but it would be great if you could , um , not t ranscribe
it all , but pick out uh , som e st uff .
m e010 [ s] : I m ean we could lis uh [ disfm arker] just sit here and list en
t o it all .
m e010 [ qy^ rt ] : Are y ou gonna have t he audio on t he web sit e ?
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ na] : Unt il we reach t he gigabyt e t hing and David Johnson s
ki kills m e . And we ’re gonna put it on t he web sit e . Yeah .

m e010 [ s.%−−] : Oh , we could get [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bu] : I m ean , you can buy anot her disk for t wo hundred
dollars ,
m e010 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e010 [ s.%−−] : I m ean it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not like [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ b] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ t c] : So , we ’ll t ake care of David Johnson .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ ng] : No , he [ disfm arker] uh , he [ disfm arker] he has been
solv ing all our problem s or [ disfm arker] is wonderful ,
fe046 [ s^ m ] : Take [ disfm arker] care of him .
m e010 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ %−−] : so s
m e010 [ b] : Alright .
m e010 [ s] : So we ’ll buy a disk .
m e010 [ s^ cs^ t c] : But anyway , so , um , If you [ disfm arker] if you can
t hink of a way [ disfm arker] t o uh , point us t o t h t o int erest ing t hings ,
sort of as y ou ’re doing t his or [ disfm arker] or som et hing
m e010 [ s^ cs] : uh , m ake your [ disfm arker] m ake not es or som et hing
t hat [ disfm arker] t hat t his is , you know , som et hing wort h looking at .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : And ot her t han t hat , yeah I guess we ’ll just have t o uh
, list en [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bu] : alt hough I guess it ’s only t en m inut es each ,
m e010 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e010 [ s^ e] : Roughly .
fe046 [ h|s^ am ] : Well , I guess .
fe046 [ s^ no] : I ’m not sure how long it ’s act ually going t o t ake .
m n015 [ s] : The reading t ask is a lot short er .
m n015 [ s] : That was cut by fift y percent .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : And t he reading ,
m n015 [ s] : nobody ’s int erest ed in t hat except for t he speech people .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ na] : No , we don’t care about t hat at all .
m n015 [ %−−] : So .
m n015 [ s] : It ’s act ually like five m inut es dialogue .
m e010 [ s^ ng] : I b My guess is it ’s gonna be t en .
m e010 [ %−] : People [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ ng] : Ten m inut es is long .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : I underst and ,
m e010 [ s^ arp.%−] : but people [ disfm arker] people [ disfm arker] you
know uh [ disfm arker]
fe046 [ s^ aap] : It feels like a long t im e
fe046 [ fh] : but .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ na] : It feels like forever when y ou ’re doing it ,

m n015 [ s] : but t hen it t urns out t o be t hree m inut es and fort y five
seconds .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ am ] : Could be .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ b] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ df] : I was t hinking people would , you know , hesit at e and
[ disfm arker] What ev er .
m e010 [ s] : What ev er it is we ’ll [ disfm arker] we ’ll deal wit h it .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : Yeah , it ’s not [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : OK , so t hat ’ll be [ disfm arker] t hat ’ll be [ disfm arker] um
[ disfm arker] on [ disfm arker] on t he web page .
m n015 [ s] : And it ’s fun .
m n015 [ b] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ ba^ t c] : That ’s great .
m e010 [ fh|s^ t c] : Um But anyway [ disfm arker] yeah , so I t hink
[ disfm arker] it ’s a good idea t o st art wit h t he sort of relat ively st raight
forward res just response syst em .
m e010 [ s] : And t hen if we want t o uh [ disfm arker] get t hem t o st art
doing [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] m ult iple st ep planning wit h a whole
bunch of t hings and t hen organize t hem
m e010 [ %−−] : an um
m e010 [ s^ e] : t ell t hem which t hings are near each ot her
m e010 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : y ou know , any of t hat st uff .
m e010 [ fh|s^ e] : uh [ disfm arker] You know , " Which t hings would you
like t o do Tuesday m orning ? "
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s] : So yeah I [ disfm arker] t h t hat seem s [ disfm arker] pret t y
st raight forward .
fe046 [ qy^ bu.%−] : But were you saying t hat [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : I need t hose back by t he way .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe046 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ s.%−] : That ’s for [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ fa|qy^ br] : I ’m sorry , Fey , what ?
fe046 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : That w m aybe one t hing we should do is go
t hrough t his list and sort of select t hings t hat are cat egories and t hen
o offer only one m em ber of t hat cat egory ?
m e010 [ s^ na] : That ’s what I was suggest ing for t he first round , yeah
.
fe046 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e045 [ s^ e.%−−] : So rat her t han having zoo and cast le .
fe046 [ s^ bu] : And t hen , I m ean , t hey could be alt ernat e versions of
t he sam e [ disfm arker] If you want ed dat a on different const ruct ions .

m e010 [ s^ am .%−] : They could , but i but i uh t ha eh t hey c
m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ arp.%−−] : yeah , but [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] but
[ disfm arker]
fe046 [ s^ e.%−] : Like one person get s t he version wit h t he zoo as a
choice , and t he ot her person get s t he [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ am .%−] : You could ,
m e010 [ s^ arp.%−] : but i but I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I t hink in t he
short run , [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ %−] : And
m n015 [ s^ ar.%−−] : no , t h t he per
m n015 [ s^ nd] : t he person don’t get it .
m n015 [ s.%−] : I m ean , t his is why we did it , because when we gave
t hem just t hree t asks for w part − A and t hree t asks for part − B a
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
fe046 [ s^ aa^ df] : Well no , t hey could st ill choose .
fe046 [ s^ e] : They just wouldn’t be able t o choose bot h zoo and say ,
t ouring t he cast le .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Exact ly .
m n015 [ s^ bs] : This is lim it ing t he choices , but yeah .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n015 [ s^ fa] : OK , sorry .
m n015 [ s] : But um I [ disfm arker] I t hink t his approach will very well
work ,
m n015 [ s] : but t he person was able t o look at it and say " OK , This is
what I would act ually do . "
fe046 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ b] : OK .
fe046 [ s^ j] : He was vicious .
m n015 [ s^ cs.%−] : OK , we got t a [ disfm arker] we got t a disallow uh
[ disfm arker] t rav eling t o zoos and uh cast les at t he sam e t im e , sort of
[ disfm arker]
fe046 [ s^ ng.%−−] : I m ean t here [ disfm arker] t hey are significant ly
different , but .
m n015 [ s^ nd.%−−] : But no , t hey ’re [ disfm arker] I m ean t hey ’re sort of
[ disfm arker] t his is where t our becom es [ disfm arker] you know
m n015 [ s] : t ourist s m aybe a bit different
fe046 [ s^ am ] : Yeah , I guess so .
m n015 [ s] : and , um , t hese are just places where you [ disfm arker]
y ou ent er um , m uch like here .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s.%−] : But we can uh [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , in fact if y if y if you use t he right verb for
each in com m on ,

m e010 [ s^ e] : like at you know , " at t end a t heat er , sym phony or
opera " is [ disfm arker] is a group ,
m e010 [ s^ e] : and " t our t he universit y , cast le or zoo " ,
m n015 [ b] : m m − hm m Yeah .
m e010 [ s] : all of t hese d do have t his kind of " t our " um [ disfm arker]
aspect about t he way you would go t o t hem .
m e010 [ fh|s] : And uh , t he m ovie t heat er is probably also uh
[ disfm arker] e is a " at t end " et cet era .
m n015 [ s^ 2] : At t end ,
m n015 [ s^ bk] : yeah .
m e010 [ s] : So it m ay t urn out t o be not so m any different kinds of
t hings ,
m n015 [ b] : Hm m , m m − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : and t hen , what one would expect is t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
t he sent ence t ypes would [ disfm arker] uh t heir responses would t end
t o be grouped according t o t he kind of act ivit y , you would expect .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n036 [ s] : But I m ean i it seem t hat um [ disfm arker] t here is a
difference bet ween going [ disfm arker] t o see som et hing , and t hings
like " ex change m oney " or " dine out "
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Oh , absolut ely .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m n036 [ s.%] : uh [ disfm arker] @ @ funct ion , y eah .
m n015 [ s.%−] : Yeah , t his is where [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ fg] : yeah [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : t h t he funct ion st uff is definit ely different and t he get t ing
inform at ion or g st uff [ disfm arker] yeah .
m n015 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : But t his is open .
m n015 [ s] : So since people gonna st ill pick som et hing , we we ’re not

m n015 [ s:qw] : And if you go t o Turkey , y ou will find when people go

m n015 [ s] : and t hey say " Ah , enough . "
m n015 [ s] : And t he [ disfm arker] and t he [ disfm arker] t his used all
ov er t he place .
m n015 [ s] : Because t he person selling t he cheese knows , you know ,
t hat person has t wo kids and y ou know , a husband t hat dislikes
cheese , so t his is enough .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : And um so t he m iddle part is always sort of t he
[ disfm arker] t he golden way ,
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n015 [ s] : So y ou can s you can be really [ disfm arker] m ake it as

"
m e045 [ s^ e] : Money is no object .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ aa^ m ] : Money is no object ,

m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : Or t he sufficient , or t he t he appropriat e am ount .

m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : But , Then again , t his m ay t urn out t o be insufficient for

m n015 [ s] : But well , t his is m y first guess ,
m e045 [ s.%−] : I m ean y
m n015 [ qh] : in m uch t he sam e way as how [ disfm arker] how d you

[ disfm arker] does t he person wanna rough it ?
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s] : I m ean [ disfm arker] t h so t here ’s a couple of different

m e045 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e045 [ s] : You know [ disfm arker] " I want t o go t here and I don’t care
if it ’s really hard . "
m e045 [ s.%−−] : Or if you ’re an ext rem e sport person , you know .
m e045 [ s] : " I wanna go t here and I insist on it being t he hard way . "
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e045 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e045 [ s] : you know , so I assum e we ’re going for t he first
int erpret at ion ,
fe046 [ b] : Right .
m e045 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e045 [ s.%−−] : Som et hing like [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s.%−−] : I ’ll go t h
m e045 [ s.%−−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s.%−−] : I ’d li
m e045 [ s^ no] : I dunno .
m e010 [ s] : No , I t hink he was going for t he second one ar act ually .
m e045 [ s.%−] : It ’s different from t hing t o [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ qy ^ bh^ rt ] : Yeah ?
m e010 [ s^ cc] : Anyway , we ’ll sort t h yeah , we ’ll sort t hat out .
m e045 [ s.%−] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Absolut ely .
m n015 [ s] : Well , t his is all sort of um , t op of m y head .
m n015 [ s] : No [ disfm arker] no research behind t hat .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .

m n015 [ s^ rt ^ t c] : Um [ disfm arker] " Object inform at ion " ,
m n015 [ s:qh^ rt ] : " Do I [ disfm arker] do I wanna know anyt hing about
t hat object ? "
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : is eit her t rue or false .
m n015 [ s] : And . if I care about it being open , accessible or not , I
don’t t hink t here ’s any m iddle ground t here .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : Um , eit her I wanna know where it is or not ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : I wanna know about it ’s hist ory or not ,
m n015 [ s] : or , um I wanna know about what it ’s good for or not .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : May be one could put scales in t here , t oo .
m n015 [ s^ e] : So I wanna know a l lot about it .
m e010 [ fg|%−] : Yeah , now ob
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e010 [ s^ fe] : I ’m sorry ,
m e010 [ s^ co] : go ahead ,
m e010 [ qy ^ br^ rt ] : what were you gonna say ?
m n015 [ s] : One could put scales in t here .
m n015 [ s] : So I wanna know a lot about t he hist ory ,
m n015 [ s.%−] : just a bit .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , right
m e010 [ s.%−−] : well y i w if we [ disfm arker] w
m e010 [ s^ aa] : right .

m e010 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yep , t hat ’s t rue .
m e010 [ s] : Yeah , but we don’t have t o do it now .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m n015 [ s] : That was t he wrong short cut anyhow .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : And we t hink t hat ’s it , int erest ingly enough , t hat um ,
y ou know , t h
m e010 [ s] : or [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker] or som et hing very close t o
it is going t o be uh [ disfm arker] going t o be enough .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : And [ disfm arker]
fe046 [ s] : St ill wrong .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s^ bk^ rt ^ t c] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : Alright , so um [ disfm arker] So I t hink t he order of

m e010 [ s.%−−] : And [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ %−−] : What ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : well t his is t he part t hat [ disfm arker]

m e010 [ %−−] : Yeah , so [ disfm arker]

m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ aa^ r] : right ,
m e010 [ s] : so [ disfm arker] So , um In parallel , uh [ disfm arker] t hree
t hings are going t o happen .
m e010 [ s] : Uh Robert and Eva and Bhaskara are gonna act ually
[ disfm arker] build a belief − net t hat [ disfm arker] t hat , um , has CPT ’s
and , y ou know , t ries t o infer t his from various kinds of inform at ion .
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : And Fey is going t o st art collect ing dat a ,
m e010 [ s] : and we ’re gonna st art t hinking a about [ disfm arker] uh
[ disfm arker] what const ruct ions we want t o elicit .
m e010 [ s.%−] : And t hen w go it m ay it erat e on uh , furt her dat a

m e045 [ qy^ rt ] : D Do you m ean [ disfm arker] Do you m ean elicit ing

m e010 [ s^ bk] : Well , yes .
m e010 [ s] : Bot h .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ fh|s] : Uh , and [ disfm arker] Though for us , const ruct ions are

m e010 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e045 [ s^ aa^ m ] : Right .
m e010 [ s.%−] : And [ disfm arker] And so [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m e045 [ s.%−] : I m ean from m y point of view I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m t rying

m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : OK , t hat would be great

m n015 [ s^ aa] : No , no , no , no , no .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Right , Right .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : We are expect ing Johno t o build a parser ,
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Uh , t his is [ disfm arker] Yes .

m e010 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , you know , t he idea is [ disfm arker] is ,
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s] : Well , t he hope is t hat t he parser it self is , uh , pret t y
robust .
m e010 [ s.%−] : But it ’s not popular [ disfm arker] it ’s only p only
[ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Right , Right .
m e045 [ s^ 2] : Exist ence proof , you know .
m e045 [ s] : Set up t he infrast ruct ure ,
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .

m e010 [ s.%−] : It ’s only popula
m e045 [ b] : y eah .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e045 [ s^ cs^ t c] : Um som et im e , I have t o t alk t o som e subset of t he

looking for .
m e045 [ s] : I m ean , you know obviously like just again , looking at t his
one uh t hing , y ou know , I saw y t hings from [ disfm arker] sort of as
general as argum ent st ruct ure const ruct ions .
m e045 [ s] : Oh , y ou know , I have t o do Verb Phrase .
m e045 [ s] : I have t o do uh [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] unbounded
dependencies ,
m e045 [ s.%−−] : y ou know , which have a variet y of const ruct ions in
[ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s] : inst ant iat e t hat .
m e045 [ s.%−−] : On t he ot her hand I have t o have , you know ,
m e045 [ s:qh] : t here ’s part icular uh , fixed expressions , or sem i − fixed
ex pressions like " Get " plus pat h expression for , you know , " how d

m e010 [ s^ aa] : Absolut ely .
m e045 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : and it [ disfm arker] you know it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
sort of like any t hing goes .
m e045 [ s.%−] : Like [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , so t his is [ disfm arker] I t hink we ’re gonna m ainly
work on wit h George .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : OK , and hi
m e045 [ b] : OK .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : let m e f t h [ disfm arker] say what I t hink is [ disfm arker]
is [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : so t he idea is [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] first of all I
m isspoke when I said we t hought you should do t he const ruct ions .
m e010 [ s^ df] : Cause apparent ly for a linguist t hat m eans t o do
com plet ely and perfect ly .
m e010 [ s] : So what I [ disfm arker] yeah , OK , [ disfm arker] So what
[ disfm arker] what I m eant was " Do a first cut at " .
m e045 [ s.%−] : er [ disfm arker] t hat ’s what
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah .

m e010 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , Because uh [ disfm arker] we do wanna get t hem
r u perfect ly [ disfm arker] but I t hink we ’re gonna have t o do a first cut
at a lot of t hem t o see how t hey int eract .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Of course .
m e045 [ fg] : Right , exact ly .
m e045 [ s] : Now it [ disfm arker] w we t alked about t his before ,
m e045 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right .
m e045 [ s] : And I [ disfm arker] I m e it would it would be com plet ely out
of t he quest ion t o really do m ore t han , say , like , oh I don’t know , t en
, over t he sum m er ,
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s] : but uh , but you know obv iously we need t o get sort of a
general view of what t hings look like ,
m e045 [ s.%−−] : so
m e045 [ b] : y eah .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ cs.%−−] : So t he idea is going t o be t o do [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ cs] : sort of like Nancy did in som e of t he er t hese papers
where y ou do enough of t hem so you can go from t op t o bot t om
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ cs] : so you can do f you know , f f uh [ disfm arker] have a
com plet e st ory ov of s of som e piece of dialogue .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : And t hat ’s gonna be m uch m ore useful t han having all of
t he clausal const ruct ions and not hing else , or [ disfm arker] or
[ disfm arker] or som et hing like t hat .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ b] : Sure .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ cs] : So t hat t he [ disfm arker] t he t rick is going t o be t t o
t ake t his and pick a [ disfm arker] som e sort of lat t ice of const ruct ions ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : so som e lexical and som e phrasal , and [ disfm arker]
and , y ou know ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : what ever you need in order t o uh , be able t o t hen , uh ,
by hand , you know , explain , som e fract ion of t he ut t erances .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ fh|s] : And so , exact ly which ones will part ly depend on your
research int erest s and a bunch of ot her t hings .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m e045 [ b] : OK .
m e045 [ s] : But I m ean in t erm s of t he s t h sort of level of uh
[ disfm arker] of analy sis ,

m e045 [ s^ bu] : y ou know , t hese don’t necessarily have t o be m ore
com plex t han like t he " Out of " const ruct ion in t he BCP paper where it
’s just like , you know , half a page on each one or som et hing .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Correct .
m e010 [ s^ aa.x] : Oh yeah [ disfm arker] yeah .
m e010 [ s^ na] : V a half a page is [ disfm arker] is what we ’d like .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s] : And if [ disfm arker] if t here ’s som et hing t hat really requires
a lot m ore t han t hat t hen it does
m e010 [ s^ e] : and we have t o do it ,
m e010 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s^ 2] : For t he first cut , t hat should be fine , yeah .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : We could sit down and t hink of sort of t he [ disfm arker]
t he ideal speaker ut t erances ,
m n015 [ s] : and I m ean t wo or t hree t hat follow each ot her ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ j] : so , where we can also sort of , once we have everyt hing
up and running , show t he t rem endous , insane inferencing
capabilit ies of our syst em .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : So , you know , as [ disfm arker] as t he Sm art Kom people
have .
m n015 [ s] : This is sort of t heir st andard dem o dialogue , which is , you
know , what t he syst em survives and not hing but t hat .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : Um , we could also sor sort of have t he analogen of o our

m n015 [ s] : t he ideal sent ences where we have com plet e const ruct ion
cov erage and , sort of , t hey m at ch nicely .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ qh] : So t he [ disfm arker] t he " How do I get t o X ? " ,
m n015 [ s] : y ou know , t hat ’s definit ely gonna be uh , a m ajor one .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s] : That ’s about six t im es in t his lit t le one here , so uh ,
[ v ocalsound] yeah .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ b.x] : Yep .
m n015 [ qh^ cs] : " Where is X ? "
m n015 [ s] : m ight be anot her one which is not t oo com plicat ed .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : And um " Tell m e som et hing about X . "

m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : And hey , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s already covering
eight y percent of t he syst em ’s funct ionalit y .
m e010 [ fg|s^ arp] : Ye − Right , but it ’s not covering eight y percent of
t he int ellect ual int erest .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
