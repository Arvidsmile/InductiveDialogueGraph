fe004 [ z] : I ’m [ disfm arker] What ?
fe004 [ z] : Really ?
fe004 [ z] : Oh , t hat ’s horrible !
fe004 [ z] : Disincent ive !
m n015 [ z] : OK , we ’re recording .
fe004 [ z] : Hello ?
m e003 [ z] : Check check [ pause] check check .
fe004 [ z] : Hello ?
fn050 [ z] : Uh , yeah .
fe004 [ z] : Which am I ?
m e010 [ z] : Oh right .
m e003 [ z] : Alright . Good .
fe004 [ z] : Channel fi OK .
fe004 [ z] : OK .
fe004 [ qy^ rt ^ t ] : Are you doing som et hing ?
fe004 [ s^ bk|s^ t ] : OK , t hen I guess I ’m doing som et hing .
fe004 [ fh] : So , um ,
fe004 [ s] : So basically t he result of m m uch t hinking since t he last
t im e we m et , um , but not as m uch writ ing , um , is a sheet t hat I have
a lot of , like , t hought s and just ificat ion of com m ent s on
fe004 [ s] : but I ’ll just pass out as is right now .
fe004 [ fh] : So , um ,
fe004 [ s] : here .
fe004 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : If you could pass t his around ?
fe004 [ s] : And t here ’s t wo t hings .
fe004 [ s] : And so one on one side is [ disfm arker] on one side is a sort
of t he rev ised sort of updat ed sem ant ic specificat ion .
fn050 [ %−] : Um [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : And t he ot her side is , um , sort of a revised const ruct ion
form alism .
fn050 [ %−] : The [ disfm arker]
fn050 [ s^ co] : wait .
m e045 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g] : This is just one sheet , right ?
fn050 [ s^ bk] : Ah !
fe004 [ s^ na] : It ’s just one sheet .
fn050 [ s^ na] : Just one sheet .
fe004 [ s] : It ’s just a [ disfm arker] Not hing else .
fn050 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fn050 [ s] : Front , back .
fe004 [ fh] : Um ,
fe004 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Enough t o go around ?
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : And in som e ways it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
v ery sim ilar t o [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : There are very few changes in som e ways from what we ’ve ,
um , uh , b done before

fe004 [ s] : but I don’t t hink everyone here has seen all of t his .
fe004 [ s] : So , uh , I ’m not sure where t o begin .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : Um , as usual t he disclaim ers are t here are [ disfm arker]
all t hese t hings are [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : it ’s only slight ly m ore st able t han it was before .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : And , um , aft er a lit t le bit m ore discussion and especially
like Keit h and I [ disfm arker] I have m ore linguist ic t hings t o set t le in t he
next few days , um , it ’ll probably change again som e m ore .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : Um , m aybe I will [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : let ’s st art b let ’s st art on num ber t wo act ually on t he
not at ion ,
fe004 [ s^ df.%−−] : um , because t hat ’s ,
fe004 [ s] : I ’m t hinking , possibly a lit t le m ore fam iliar t o , um
[ disfm arker] t o people .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : OK , so t he t op block is just sort of a [ disfm arker] sort of
abst ract not a
fe004 [ s] : it ’s sort of like , um , list ings of t he kinds of t hings t hat we
can have .
fe004 [ s] : And cert ain t hings t hat have , um , changed , have changed
back t o t his .
fe004 [ s] : There [ disfm arker] t here ’s been a lit t le bit of , um , going
back and fort h .
fe004 [ s] : But basically obviously all const ruct ions have som e kind of
nam e .
fe004 [ s] : I forgot t o include t hat y ou could have a t ype included in
t his line .
m e010 [ s.%−] : What I was gonna [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−−] : So som et hing like , um [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s] : Well , t here ’s an exam ple [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : t he t ext ual exam ple at t he end has clausal const ruct ion .
fe004 [ fh] : So ,
fe004 [ s] : um , just t o show it doesn’t have t o be beaut iful
fe004 [ s] : It could be , you know , sim ple old t ext as well .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : Um , t here are a couple of [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : Uh , t hese t hree have various ways of doing cert ain t hings .
fe004 [ s] : So I ’ll just t ry t o go t hrough t hem .
fe004 [ s] : So t hey could all have a t ype at t he beginning .
fe004 [ s] : Um , and t hen t hey say t he key word const ruct ion
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see .
fe004 [ s] : and t hey have som e nam e .
m e010 [ s^ bu.%−] : So [ disfm arker] so t he current synt ax is if it s if
t here ’s a t ype it ’s before const ruct
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , right .

m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : OK , t hat ’s fine .
fe004 [ fg|s] : OK , and t hen it has a block t hat is const it uent s .
fe004 [ s] : And as usual I guess all t he const ruct ions her all t he
ex am ples here hav e only , um , t sk [ com m ent ] one t ype of const it uent
,
fe004 [ s^ e] : t hat is a const ruct ional const it uent .
fe004 [ s] : I t hink t hat ’s act ually gonna t urn out t o m be cert ainly t he
m ost com m on kind .
fe004 [ s] : But in general inst ead of t he word " const ruct " , t h here
y ou m ight hav e " m eaning " or " form " as well .
fe004 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ?
fe004 [ s] : So if t here ’s som e elem ent t hat doesn’t [ disfm arker] t hat
isn’t y et const ruct ional in t he sense t hat it m aps form and m eaning .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
fe004 [ fh|s.%−−] : um , t he m ain change wit h t he const ruct s which
[ disfm arker] each of which has , um , t he key word " const ruct " and
t hen som e nam e , and t hen som e t ype specificat ion , is t hat it ’s
[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : it ’s pro it ’s oft en [ disfm arker] som et im es t he case in t he
first case here t hat you know what kind of const ruct ion it is .
fe004 [ s:s] : So for exam ple what ever I have here is gonna be a form of
t he word " t hrow " ,
fe004 [ s^ e:s] : or it ’s gonna be a form of t he word , you know , I don’t
know , " happy " , or som et hing like t hat .
fe004 [ s] : Or , you know , som e it ’ll be a specific word
fe004 [ s^ e] : or m aybe you ’ll have t he t ype .
fe004 [ s:s] : You ’ll say " I need a p uh spat ial relat ion phrase here "
fe004 [ s^ e:s] : or " I need a direct ional specifier here " .
fe004 [ s] : So − uh you could have a j a act ual t ype here .
fe004 [ s] : Um , or you could just say in t he second case t hat you only
know t he m eaning t ype .
fe004 [ s] : So a v ery com m on ex am ple of t his is t hat , you know , in
direct ed m ot ion , t he first person t o do som et hing should be an agent
of som e kind ,
fe004 [ s^ e] : oft en a hum an .
fe004 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
fe004 [ s.%−−] : So if I [ disfm arker] you know , t he um , uh , run down t he
st reet t hen I [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I run down t he st reet ,
fe004 [ s:s] : it ’s t yped , uh , " I " ,
fe004 [ s^ e] : m eaning cat egory is what ’s t here .
fe004 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he new kind is t his one t hat is sort of a
pair
fe004 [ fh] : and , um ,
fe004 [ s] : sort of skipping font s and what ever .

fe004 [ s] : The idea is t hat som et im es t here are , um , general
const ruct ions t hat y ou know , t hat y ou ’re going t o need .
fe004 [ s] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s t he equivalent of a noun phrase or a
preposit ional phrase , or som et hing like t hat t here .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : And usually it has form al um , considerat ions t hat will go
along wit h it .
m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : And t hen uh , you m ight know som et hing m uch m ore
specific depending on what const ruct ion y ou ’re t alking about ,
fe004 [ s^ e] : about what m eaning [ disfm arker] what specific m eaning
y ou want .
fe004 [ s:s] : So t he exam ple again at t he bot t om , which is direct ed
m ot ion ,
fe004 [ s] : you m ight need a nom inal ex pression t o t ake t he place of ,
y ou know , um , " t he big t h " , you you know , " t he big [ disfm arker] t he
t all dark m an " , you know , " walked int o t he room " .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : But because of t he nat ure of t his part icular const ruct ion
y ou know not just t hat it ’s nom inal of som e kind
fe004 [ s] : but in part icular , t hat it ’s som e kind of anim at e nom inal ,
fe004 [ s] : and which will apply just as well t o like , you know , a per you
know , a sim ple proper noun
fe004 [ s^ e] : or t o som e com plicat ed expression .
fe004 [ fh] : Um ,
fe004 [ s^ no] : so I don’t know if t he synt ax will hold but som et hing t hat
giv es y ou a way t o do bot h const ruct ional and m eaning t ypes .
fe004 [ fh] : So .
fe004 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : OK , t hen I don’t t hink t he , [ com m ent ] um
[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−−] : at least [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk|s^ rt ] : Yeah . [ com m ent ] None of t hese exam ples have
anyt hing different for form al const raint s ?
fe004 [ s] : But y ou can refer t o any of t he , um , sort of available
elem ent s and scope ,
fe004 [ s^ f|s] : right ? which here are t he const ruct s , [ com m ent ] t o
say som et hing about t he relat ion .
fe004 [ s] : And I t hink i if you not if you com pare like t he t op block and
t he t ex t ual block , um , we dropped like t he lit t le F subscript .
fe004 [ s] : The F subscript s refer t o t he " form " piece of t he const ruct
.
m e010 [ s^ ba] : Good .
fe004 [ s] : And I t hink t hat , um , in general it ’ll be unam biguous .
fe004 [ s] : Like if you were giving a form al const raint t hen you ’re
referring t o t he form al pole of t hat .

fe004 [ s:s] : So [ disfm arker] so by saying [ disfm arker] if I just said "
Nam e one " t hen t hat m eans nam e one form al
fe004 [ s] : and we ’re t alking about form al st ruc [ com m ent ] Which
[ disfm arker] which m akes sense .
fe004 [ s] : Uh , t here are cert ain t im es when we ’ll have an except ion
t o t hat ,
fe004 [ s^ e] : in which case you could just indicat e " here I m ean t he
m eaningful for som e reason " .
fe004 [ s^ f] : Right ?
fe004 [ s] : Or [ disfm arker] Act ually it ’s m ore oft en t hat , only t o handle
t his one special case of , you know , " George and Jerry walk int o t he
room in t hat order " .
fe004 [ s] : So we have a few funny t hings where som et hing in t he
m eaning m ight refer t o som et hing in t he form .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but s we ’re not gonna really worry about
t hat for right now
fe004 [ s] : and t here are way We can be m ore specific if we have t o
lat er on .
fe004 [ s^ bk|s^ t ^ t c] : OK , and so in t erm s of t he [ disfm arker] t he
relat ions ,
fe004 [ s] : you know , as usual t hey ’re before and ends .
fe004 [ s] : I should have put an ex am ple in of som et hing t hat isn’t an
int erv al relat ion
fe004 [ s] : but in form you m ight also have a value binding .
fe004 [ s:s] : You know , you could say t hat , um , you know , " nam e −
one dot " , t y ou know , " num ber equals " , you know , a plural or
som et hing like t hat .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : There are cert ain t hings t hat are at t ribut e − value , sim ilar
t o t he bindings below
fe004 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : but I m ean t hey ’re just [ disfm arker] us usually
t hey ’re going t o be value [ disfm arker] value fillers , right ?
fe004 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , and t hen again sem ant ic const raint s here are
just [ disfm arker] are just bindings .
fe004 [ s] : There was t alk of changing t he nam e of t hat .
fe004 [ s] : And Johno and I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker]
y ou and I can like fight about t hat if you like ?
fe004 [ s^ rt ] : but about changing it t o " sem ant ic [ pause] n effect s " ,
fe004 [ s] : which I t hought was a lit t le bit t oo order − biased
m e003 [ %−] : Well [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ %−] : Th
fe004 [ s] : and " sem ant ic bindings " ,
fe004 [ s^ df] : which I t hought m ight be t oo rest rict ive in case we don’t
have only bindings .

fe004 [ s] : And so it was an issue whet her const raint s [ disfm arker] um
, t here were som e linguist s who react ed against " const raint s " ,
say ing , " oh , if it ’s not used for m at ching , t hen it shouldn’t be called
a const raint " .
fe004 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : But I t hink we want t o be uncom m it t ed about
whet her it ’s used for m at ching or not . Right ?
fe004 [ s^ df] : Cuz t here are [ disfm arker] I t hink we t hought of som e
sit uat ions where it would be useful t o use what ever t he c bindings are
, for
fe004 [ s^ e] : act ual , you know , sort of like m odified const raining
purposes .
m e010 [ s] : Well , you definit ely want t o de − couple t he form alism from
t he parsing st rat egy .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So t hat whet her or not it ’s used for m at ching or only
for v erificat ion , I [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah .
fe004 [ s^ 2|s^ aa] : It ’s used shouldn’t m at t er , right ?
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ e] : s For sure .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ bd^ no] : I m ean , I don’t know what , uh , t erm we want t o
use
m e010 [ s^ df.%−] : but we don’t want t o [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk|s:s] : Yeah , uh , t here was one t im e when [ disfm arker]
when Hans explained why " const raint s " was a m isleading word for him
.
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
fe004 [ s] : And I t hink t he reason t hat he gave was sim ilar t o t he
reason why Johno t hought it was a m isleading t erm ,
fe004 [ s] : which was just an int erest ing coincidence .
fe004 [ fh] : Um , but , uh [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s:s^ bk|s^ rt ] : And so I was like , " OK , well bot h of you don’t like
it ?
fe004 [ s^ bk|s^ cs^ rt ] : Fine , we can change it " .
m e010 [ s] : It ’s g it ’s gone .
fe004 [ s] : But I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I ’m st art ing t o like it again .
fe004 [ s] : So t hat t hat ’s why [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] That ’s why I ’ll
st ick wit h it .
m e003 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qw] : Well , you know what ?
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ] : If y ou have an " if − t hen " phrase , do you know what
t he " t hen " phrase is called ?
m e010 [ %−] : Th
fe004 [ qw] : What ?

fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Con − uh , a consequent ?
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ bk|s^ nd] : Yeah , but it ’s not an " if − t hen " .
m e010 [ s^ na] : I know .
m e010 [ fg|s^ cs:s] : Anyway , so t he ot her [ disfm arker] t he ot her
st rat egy you guys could consider is when y ou don’t know what word t o
put , y ou could put no word ,
m n015 [ s^ ar|%−] : No , but [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ e:s] : just m eaning .
m e010 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s.%−] : And t he t hen let [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , t hat ’s t rue .
m e003 [ qy^ bu^ d] : So t hat ’s why you put sem ant ic const raint s up t op
and m eaning bindings down [ disfm arker] down here ?
fe004 [ s^ bk|s^ fe] : Oh , oops !
fe004 [ s^ ar|s^ df] : No . That was just a m ist ake of cut and past e from
when I was going wit h it .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ fa] : So , I ’m sorry .
fe004 [ s] : I didn’t m ean [ disfm arker] t hat one ’s an in unint ent ional .
m e003 [ s.%−] : So t his should be sem ant ic and [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : Som et im es I ’m int ent ionally inconsist ent
m e003 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
fe004 [ s^ df^ rt ] : cuz I ’m not sure yet .
fe004 [ s] : Here , I act ually [ disfm arker] it was just a m ist ake .
m e003 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : Th − so t his definit ely should be " sem ant ic
const raint s " down at t he bot t om ?
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s:s] : Well , unless I go wit h " m eaning "
fe004 [ s:s] : but i I m ean , I kind of like " m eaning " bet t er t han "
sem ant ic "
m e003 [ %−] : Or [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bd] : Oh , what ever .
fe004 [ s] : but I t hink t here ’s [ pause] vest iges of ot her people ’s
biases .
m e010 [ %−] : Or [ disfm arker] wh
fe004 [ %−−] : Like [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ %−] : That − b
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : Minor [ disfm arker] m in problem [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ m ^ na] : Minor point .

m e045 [ s^ na] : Ex t rem ely .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ fg] : OK , um ,
fe004 [ s] : so I t hink t he m iddle block doesn’t really give you any m ore
inform at ion , ex t han t he t op block .
fe004 [ s] : And t he bot t om block sim ilarly only just illus you know , all it
does is illust rat e t hat you can drop t he subscript s and [ disfm arker]
and t hat y ou can drop t he , um [ disfm arker] uh , t hat you can give dual
t y pes .
fe004 [ s] : Oh , one t hing I should m ent ion is about " designat es " .
fe004 [ s^ rt ] : I t hink I ’m act ually inconsist ent across t hese as well .
fe004 [ s^ co] : So , um , st rike out t he M subscript on t he m iddle block
.
m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : So basically now , um , t his is act ually [ disfm arker] t his lit t le
change act ually goes along wit h a big linguist ic change ,
fe004 [ s] : which is t hat " designat es " isn’t only som et hing for t he
sem ant ics t o worry about now .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : Good .
fe004 [ s] : So we want s " designat es " t o act ually know one of t he
const it uent s which act s like a head in som e respect s
fe004 [ s] : but is sort of , um , really im port ant for say com posit ion
lat er on .
fe004 [ s] : So for inst ance , if som e ot her const ruct ion says , you know
, " are you of t y pe [ disfm arker] is t his part of t ype what ever " , um , t he
" designat es " t ells you which sort of part is t he m eaning part .
fe004 [ s^ rt :s] : OK , so if you hav e like " t he big red ball " , you know ,
y ou wanna know if t here ’s an object or a noun .
fe004 [ s:s] : Well , ball is going t o be t he designat ed sort of elem ent of
t hat kind of phrase .
m e045 [ b] : Mm m .
fe004 [ fh] : Um ,
fe004 [ s] : t here is a slight com plicat ion here which is t hat when we
t alk about form it ’s useful som et im es t o t alk about , um [ disfm arker]
t o t alk about t here also being a designat ed object
fe004 [ s|s^ f] : and we t hink t hat t hat ’ll be t he sam e one , right ?
fe004 [ s:s] : So t he ball is t he head of t he phrase ,
fe004 [ s^ e:s] : " t he r t he [ disfm arker] " , um , " big red ball " ,
fe004 [ s] : and t he ent it y denot ed by t he word " ball " is sort of t he
sem ant ic head in som e ways of [ disfm arker] of t his sort of , um , in
int erest ing larger elem ent .
m e010 [ s.%−] : A a and t he [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ bu] : And t here ’s [ disfm arker] uh t here ’s ca som e cases
where t he gram m ar depends on som e form propert y of t he head .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ bu] : And [ disfm arker] and t his enables you t o get t hat , if I
underst and you right .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Right , right .
m e045 [ s^ na] : That ’s t he idea .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yeah yeah .
fe004 [ s] : And , uh , you m ight be able t o say t hings like if t he head
has t o go last in a head − final language , you can refer t o t he head as
a p t he , y ou know [ disfm arker] t he form al head as opposed t o t he
rest of t he form hav ing t o be at t he end of t hat decision .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe004 [ s] : So t hat ’s a useful t hing
fe004 [ s^ df] : so t hat you can get som e int ernal st ruct ural const raint s
in .
m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : OK , so t hat all looks good .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : Let m e [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ %−−] : Oh , w Oh .
m e010 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m e010 [ qy] : Were y ou finished ?
fe004 [ h|s] : Um , t here was a list of t hings t hat isn’t included
fe004 [ s] : but you [ disfm arker] you can [ disfm arker] you can ask a
quest ion .
fe004 [ s^ e] : That m ight @ @ it .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So , i if I underst and t his t he [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : aside from , uh , const rued and all t hat sort of st uff , t he
[ disfm arker] t he differences are m ainly t hat , [ vocalsound] we ’ve gone
t o t he possibilit y of having form − m eaning pairs for a t ype
fe004 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ bsc] : or act ually gone back t o ,
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s.%−] : if we go back far enough [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ arp] : Well , except for t heir const ruct ion m eaning ,
fe004 [ s.%−−] : so it ’s not clear t hat ,
fe004 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : Well , right now it ’s a c uh cont r const ruct ion t ype and
m eaning t ype .
fe004 [ s^ no] : So I don’t know what a form t ype is .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
m e010 [ s^ fa] : I ’m sorry ,
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s] : y ou ’re right .
m e010 [ s] : A const ruct ion t ype .

m e010 [ s^ ba] : Uh , t hat ’s fine .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e010 [ s.%−] : But it , um [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : A well , and a previous , um , you know , version of t he
not at ion cert ainly allowed you t o single out t he m eaning bit by it .
fe004 [ s] : So y ou could say " const ruct of t ype what ever designat es
som et hing " .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : But t hat was m ost ly for reference purposes ,
fe004 [ s] : just t o refer t o t he m eaning pole .
fe004 [ s] : I don’t t hink t hat it was oft en used t o give an ext ra m eaning
const t y pe const raint on t he m eaning ,
fe004 [ s] : which is really what we want m ost of t he t im e I t hink .
m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ fh] : Um ,
fe004 [ s^ no.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know if we ’ll ever have a case
where we act ually h
fe004 [ s] : if t here is a form cat egory const raint , you could im agine
having a t riple t here t hat says , you know [ disfm arker] t hat ’s kind of
weird .
m e010 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : No , no , no , I don’t t hink so .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : I t hink t hat you ’ll [ disfm arker] you ’ll do fine .
m e045 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : In fact , t hese are , um ,
m e010 [ s] : as long as [ disfm arker] as Mark isn’t around , t hese are
form const raint s .
m e010 [ s] : So a nom inal expression is [ disfm arker] uh , t he fact t hat it
’s anim at e , is sem ant ic .
m e010 [ s^ e] : The fact t hat it ’s n uh , a nom inal expression I would
say on m ost people ’s not ion of [ disfm arker] of f you know , higher form
t y pes , t his i t his is one .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Right , right .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : And I t hink t hat ’s just fine .
fe004 [ s^ m ^ na|s^ aa] : Which is fine , yeah .
m e045 [ s] : It ’s [ disfm arker] t hat now , um , I ’m m ent ioned t his ,
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s^ bd^ df^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know if I ever explained
t his
m e045 [ s.%−−] : but t he point of , um ,
m e045 [ s.%−−:s] : I m ent ioned in t he last m eet ing , [ com m ent ] t he point
of hav ing som et hing called " nom inal expression " is , um ,

m e045 [ s^ rt ] : because it seem s like having t he verb subcat egorize for
, you know , like say t aking as it s object just som e expression which ,
um , designat es an object or designat es a t hing , or what ever , um ,
t hat leads t o som e synt act ic problem s basically ?
m e045 [ s:s] : So you wanna , y ou know [ disfm arker] you sort of hav e
t his problem like " OK , well , I ’ll put t he word " , uh , let ’s say , t he
word " dog " ,
m e045 [ s^ f|s] : y ou know . And t hat has t o com e right aft er t he verb
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s^ df] : cuz we know verb m eet s it s object .
m e045 [ s:s] : And t hen we have a const ruct ion t hat says , oh , you can
have " t he " preceding a noun .
m e045 [ s] : And so y ou ’d have t his sort of problem t hat t he verb has
t o m eet t he designat um .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e045 [ s:s] : And you could get , you know , " t he kicked dog " or
som et hing like t hat , m eaning " kicked t he dog " .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e045 [ s] : Um , so y ou kind of have t o let t his phrase idea in t here
m e045 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ ba] : That I [ disfm arker] I have no problem wit h it at all .
m e045 [ %−] : It − it
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : I t hink it ’s fine .
fe004 [ s^ bk|%−−] : Right , n s
fe004 [ s] : y ou m ay be [ disfm arker] you m ay not be like everyone else
in [ disfm arker] in Berkeley ,
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ ba] : but t hat ’s OK .
m e045 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , we [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] we sort of
t hought we were get t ing away wit h , uh [ disfm arker] wit h , a p
fe004 [ s^ bd] : Uh , we don’t m ind eit her ,
fe004 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s] : I m ean , t his is not rev ert ing t o t he X − bar t heory of
[ disfm arker] of phrase st ruct ure .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e045 [ fh] : But , uh ,
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e045 [ s] : I just know t hat t his is [ disfm arker] Like , we didn’t
originally have in m ind t hat , uh [ disfm arker] t hat verbs would
subcat egorize for a part icular sort of form .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ df^ rt ] : But t hey do .
m e045 [ fh] : Um ,

m e045 [ s^ m ^ na] : but t hey does .
fe004 [ s] : Well , t here ’s an alt ernat ive t o t his
m e045 [ s^ aap^ e] : At least in English .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : which is , um [ disfm arker] The quest ion was did we want
direct ed m ot ion ,
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : which is an argum ent st ruct ure const ruct ion
[ disfm arker]
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ qy .%−−] : did we want it t o worry about , um , anyt hing m ore t han
t he fact t hat it , y ou know , has sem ant ic [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : You know , it ’s sort of fram e − based const ruct ion .
fe004 [ s] : So one opt ion t hat , you know , Keit h had m ent ioned also
was like , well if y ou have m ore abst ract const ruct ions such as subject
, predicat e , basically t hings like gram m at ical relat ions ,
m e045 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : t hose could int ersect wit h t hese
fe004 [ s] : in such a way t hat subject , predicat e , or subject ,
predicat e , subject , verb , ob you know , v erb object would require
t hat t hose t hings t hat f fill a subject and object are NOM expressions .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s] : And t hat would be a lit t le bit cleaner in som e way .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : But you know , for now , I m ean ,
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ bd] : But it [ disfm arker] y y it ’s [ disfm arker] yeah , just
m ov ing it [ disfm arker] m oving t he c t he cons t he const raint s around .
fe004 [ fh] : uh , you know .
fe004 [ s^ m ^ na|s^ aa] : M m oving it t o anot her place , right .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ fg|s.%−] : OK , so t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bu|qy ^ d^ g] : But t here does [ disfm arker] basically , t he
point is t here has t o be t hat const raint som ewhere , right ?
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe004 [ fh] : So ,
fe004 [ s^ bk] : y eah .
m e010 [ s.%−] : And so t hat was t he [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Robert ’s not happy now ?
m n015 [ s^ ar] : No !
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e010 [ fg|s] : OK , and sort of going wit h t hat is t hat t he designat um
also now is a pair .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yes .
m e010 [ s^ e] : Inst ead of just t he m eaning .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e010 [ s^ bu] : And t hat aside from som e t erm inology , t hat ’s
basically it .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ bd^ df] : I just want t o b I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m asking .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
fe004 [ s] : um , t he un sort of t he un − addressed quest ions in t his ,
um , definit ely would for inst ance be sem ant ic const raint s we t alked
about .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ e] : Here are just bindings
fe004 [ %−−] : but ,
fe004 [ s^ f] : right ?
fe004 [ s^ rt ] : we m ight want t o int roduce m ent al spaces [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−] : You know , t here ’s all t hese t hings t hat we don’t
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ nd] : The whole [ disfm arker] t he m ent al space t hing is
clearly not here .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Right ?
fe004 [ s] : So t here ’s going t o be som e ex t ra [ disfm arker] you know ,
definit ely ot her not at ion we ’ll need for t hat which we skip for now .
m e045 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : By t he way , I do want t o get on t hat as soon as Robert
get s back .
fe004 [ fh] : Uh
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : So , uh , t he [ disfm arker] t he m ent al space t hing .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : Um , obviously , [ vocalsound] const rual is a b is a b is a big
com ponent of t hat
m e010 [ s] : so t his probably not wort h t ry ing t o do anyt hing t ill he get s
back .
m e010 [ s^ cs.%−] : But sort of as soon as he get s back I t hink um , we
ought t o [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ qw] : So what ’s t he [ disfm arker] what ’s t he t im e fram e ?
m e045 [ s.%−−] : I forgot again when
m e045 [ qw] : y ou ’re going away for how long ?
m n015 [ s] : Just , uh , as a [ disfm arker] sort of a m ent al bridge , I ’m

m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : So , uh , [ vocalsound] right aft erwards I ’m back .

m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ qw] : What ?
fe004 [ qy^ bu^ d^ j] : You ’re m issing like t he prem ier Am erican holiday

fe004 [ qw^ j] : What ’s t he point of spending a year here ?
m n015 [ s^ bd^ df] : Uh , I ’ve had it oft en enough .

fe004 [ s^ arp] : Not in California .
fe004 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , t hat ’s t rue .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe004 [ s] : I like [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I like spending fourt h of July
in ot her count ries , [ vocalsound] whenever I can .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ fg|s^ ba^ t ^ t c] : OK , so t hat ’s great .
fe004 [ s^ t c] : Const rual ,
fe004 [ s^ bk|%−−] : OK , so [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : Oh , so t here was one quest ion t hat cam e out .
fe004 [ s] : I hat e t his t hing .
fe004 [ s^ fa] : Sorry .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : Um , which is ,
fe004 [ s] : so som et hing like " past " which i you know , we t hink is a
v ery sim ple [ disfm arker] uh , we ’v e oft en just st uck it in as a feat ure ,
m e010 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s:s] : you know , " oh , [ pause] t his event t akes place before
speech t im e " , [ com m ent ] OK , is what t his m eans .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s] : Um , it ’s oft en t hought of as [ disfm arker] it is also
considered a m ent al space ,
m e010 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ e] : y ou know , by , you know , lot s of people around here .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ rt :s^ rt ] : So t here ’s t his issue of well som et im es t here are
really exot ic ex plicit space builders t hat say " in France , blah − blah −
blah " ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : and you have t o build up [ disfm arker] you ha you would
im agine t hat would require you , y ou know , t o be very specific about
t he m achinery ,
fe004 [ s] : whereas past is a very convent ionalized one

fe004 [ s] : and we sort of know what it m eans
fe004 [ s] : but it [ disfm arker] we doesn’t [ disfm arker] don’t necessarily
want t o , you know , unload all t he not at ion ev ery t im e we see t hat it ’s
past t ense .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s] : So , you know , we could t hink of our [ disfm arker] uh , just
like X − schem a " walk " refers t o t his com plicat ed st ruct ure , past
refers t o , y ou know , a cert ain configurat ion of t his t hing wit h respect
t o it .
m e010 [ s^ na] : I t hink t hat ’s exact ly right .
fe004 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so we ’re kind of like having our cake and
eat ing it [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ e|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : you know , having it bot h ways , right ?
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ %−] : So , i i
m e010 [ s^ aa|s^ bd] : Yeah . [ pause] No , I t hink [ disfm arker] I t hink
t hat i we ’ll have t o see how it works out when we do t he det ails
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ df] : but m y int uit ion would be t hat t hat ’s right .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , OK .
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ] : Do y ou want t o do t he sam e for space ?
fe004 [ qw^ br] : Wha − sorry ?
m n015 [ s^ r] : Space ?
fe004 [ qw^ br^ m ] : Space ?
m n015 [ s^ e] : Here ?
m n015 [ s^ e] : Now ?
fe004 [ s^ bk|qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Oh , oh , oh , oh , inst ead of just t im e ?
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ na] : Sam e t hing .
fe004 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : So t here are very convent ionalized like deict ic
ones , right ?
fe004 [ s.%−−] : And t hen I t hink for ot her spaces t hat you int roduce ,
y ou could just at t ach y
fe004 [ s] : what ev er [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : You could build up an appropriat ely [ disfm arker] uh ,
appropriat e st ruct ure according t o t he l t he sent ence .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m ,
m n015 [ s:s] : well t his [ disfm arker] t his basically would involve
ev ery t hing you can im agine t o fit under your C dot som et hing
[ disfm arker]
m e045 [ %−] : N
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

m n015 [ s^ e] : you know , where [ disfm arker] where it ’s cont ext ually
dependent ,
fe004 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ qh] : " what is now ,
m n015 [ qh] : what was past ,
m n015 [ qh] : what is in t he fut ure ,
m n015 [ qh] : where is t his ,
m n015 [ qh] : what is here ,
m n015 [ qh] : what is t here ,
m n015 [ qh.%−−] : what is [ disfm arker] "
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : So t im e and space .
fe004 [ s] : Um , we ’ll [ disfm arker] we ’ll get t hat on t he ot her side a
lit t le , like very m inim ally .
fe004 [ s] : There ’s a sort of t here ’s a slot for set t ing t im e and set t ing
place .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : Good .
fe004 [ fh] : And
fe004 [ s] : y ou know , you could im agine for bot h of t hose are absolut e
t hings y ou could say about t he t im e and place ,
fe004 [ s] : and t hen t here are m any in m ore int erest ingly , linguist ically
anyway , [ com m ent ] t here are relat iv e t hings t hat , you know , you
relat e t he ev ent in t im e and space t o where you are now .
fe004 [ s] : If t here ’s som et hing a lot m ore com plicat ed like , or so
[ disfm arker] hy pot het ical or what ev er , t hen you have t o do your job ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ e] : like or som ebody ’s job anyway .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : I ’m gonna point t o [ disfm arker] at random .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m s curious about how
m uch of t he m ent al [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ no] : I m ean , I ’m not sure t hat t he form alism , sort of t he
gram m at ical side of t hings , [ com m ent ] is gonna have t hat m uch going
on in t erm s of t he m ent al space st uff .
m e045 [ s.%−−] : You know , um , basically all of t hese so − called space
builders t hat are in t he sent ence are going t o sort of [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s.%−−] : I t hink of it as , sort of giving you t he coordinat es of ,
y ou know [ disfm arker]

m e045 [ s] : assum ing t hat at any point in discourse t here ’s t he
possibilit y t hat we could be sort of t alking about a bunch of different
world scenarios , what ever , and t he speaker ’s supposed t o be
keeping t rack of t hose . The , um [ disfm arker] t he const ruct ion t hat
y ou act ually get is just gonna sort of give you a cue as t o which one of
t hose t hat y ou ’ve already got going , um , you ’re supposed t o add
st ruct ure t o .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s:s] : So " in France , uh , Wat ergat e wouldn’t have hurt Nixon "
or som et hing like t hat .
m e045 [ s] : Um , well , you say , " alright , I ’m supposed t o add som e
st ruct ure t o m y m odel of t his hypot het ical past France universe " or
som et hing like t hat .
m e045 [ s] : The inform at ion in t he sent ence t ells you t hat m uch
m e045 [ s] : but it doesn’t t ell you like exact ly what it [ disfm arker] what
t he point of doing so is .
m e045 [ s.%−−] : So for exam ple , depending on t he linguist ic con uh ,
cont ext it could be [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ qh] : like t he quest ion is for ex am ple , what does " Wat ergat e "
refer t o t here ?
m e045 [ qh.%−−] : Does it , you know [ disfm arker] does it refer t o , um
[ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s] : if you just hear t hat sent ence cold , t he assum pt ion is t hat
when y ou say " Wat ergat e " you ’re referring t o " a Wat ergat e − like
scandal as we m ight im agine it happening in France " .
m e045 [ s:s] : But in a different cont ex t , " oh , you know , if Nixon had
apologized right away it wouldn’t [ disfm arker] you know , Wat ergat e
wouldn’t hav e hurt him so badly in t he US
m e045 [ s:s] : and in France it wouldn’t hav e hurt him at all " .
m e045 [ s] : Now we ’re s now t hat " Wat ergat e " [ disfm arker] we ’re
now t alking about t he real one ,
fe004 [ s^ na|s^ aa] : They ’re real , right .
m e045 [ s|qy^ d^ f^ g] : and t he " would " sort of [ disfm arker] it ’s a sort
of different dim ension of hypot he − t het icalit y , right ?
fe004 [ s^ na|s^ aa] : I see [ disfm arker] right .
m e045 [ s^ e:qw] : We ’re not say ing [ disfm arker] What ’s hypot het ical
about t his world .
m e045 [ s] : In t he first case , hypot het ically we ’re im agining t hat
Wat ergat e happened in France .
fe004 [ b] : Hm m .
m e045 [ s] : In t he second case we ’re im agining hypot het ically t hat
Nix on had apologized right away
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m e045 [ s^ e|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : or som et hing . Right ?
m e045 [ s] : So a lot of t his isn’t happening at t he gram m at ical level .

m e045 [ fh] : Uh , um , and so [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Correct .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s^ no] : I don’t know where t hat sit s t hen ,
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
m e045 [ s^ e] : sort of t he idea of sort ing out what t he person m eant .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : It seem s like , um , t he gram m at ical t hings such as t he
auxiliaries t hat you know int roduce t hese condit ionals , what ever , give
y ou sort of t he [ disfm arker] t he m ost basi
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s|qy^ d^ f^ g] : t h t hose we [ disfm arker] I t hink we can figure out
what t he possibilit ies are , right ?
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ df] : There are sort of a relat ively lim it ed num ber .
fe004 [ s.%−−:s] : And t hen how t hey int eract wit h som e ex t ra t hing like "

t hat t hey c t hey can [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : You know , one is a m ore specific version of t he general
pat t ern t hat t he gram m at gram m ar gives you .
fe004 [ s^ bd] : I t hink .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ bd] : But , you know , what ever ,
fe004 [ %−] : we [ disfm arker] we ’re [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ fg|s] : Yeah , in t he short run all we need is a enough
m echanism on t he form side t o get t hings going .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ %−] : Uh , I [ disfm arker] uh , y ou [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s] : But t he whole point of [ disfm arker] t he whole point of what
Fauconnier and Turner have t o say about , uh , m ent al spaces , and
blending , and all t hat st uff is t hat you don’t really get t hat m uch out of
t he sent ence .
m e045 [ s] : You know , t here ’s not t hat m uch inform at ion cont ained in
t he sent ence .
m e045 [ s:s] : It just says , " Here .
m e045 [ s:s] : Add t his st ruct ure t o t his space . "
m e045 [ s] : and ex act ly what t hat m eans for t he overall ongoing

m e045 [ s:s] : An indiv idual sent ence could m ean a hundred different

fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s] : And so som ebody ’s gonna have t o be doing a whole lot of

m e010 [ %−] : Well [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ na] : I t hink t hat ’s right .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : Oh , I [ disfm arker] yeah , I , uh , uh [ disfm arker] I t hink
t hat ’s [ disfm arker] Not k I t h
m e010 [ s^ nd] : I don’t t hink it ’s com plet ely right .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , in fact a sent ence exam ples you gave in f did
const rain t he m eaning b
m e010 [ s] : t he form did const rain t he m eaning ,
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s.%−] : and so , um , it isn’t , uh [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ bk|qh^ df] : Sure , but like what [ disfm arker] what was t he
point of say ing t hat sent ence about Nixon and France ?
m e045 [ s] : That is not [ disfm arker] t here is not hing about t hat in t he
[ disfm arker] in t he sent ence really .
fe004 [ s^ bd] : That ’s OK .
fe004 [ s^ df] : We usually don’t know t he point of t he sent ence at all .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : But we know what it ’s t rying t o say .
fe004 [ s] : We [ disfm arker] we know t hat it ’s [ disfm arker] what
predicat ion it ’s set t ing up .
m e045 [ b] : Y yeah .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ na] : But [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] bot t om line , I agree
wit h you ,
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ bd] : That ’s all .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ e.%−] : t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat we ’re not
ex pect ing m uch out of t he , uh f
fe004 [ s^ 2|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Purely linguist ic cues , right ?
m e010 [ s^ m ^ na|s^ aa] : uh , t he purely form cues , yeah .
fe004 [ fh] : So .
fe004 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ fh|s^ bd] : And , um [ disfm arker] I m ean , you ’re [ disfm arker]
y ou ’re t he linguist
m e010 [ s] : but , uh , it seem s t o m e t hat t h t hese [ disfm arker] we
[ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] you know , we ’ve t alked about m aybe a
half a dozen linguist ics t heses in t he last few m inut es or som et hing .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah , y eah .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : Yeah , I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Oh , yeah .
m e010 [ s] : uh , I [ disfm arker] I m ean , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s m y
feeling t hat [ disfm arker] t hat t hese are really hard uh , problem s t hat
decide ex act ly what [ disfm arker] what ’s going on .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ fg|s^ t ^ t c:s] : OK , so , um , one ot her t hing I just want t o point
out is t here ’s a lot of confusion about t he t erm s like " profile ,
designat e , focus " , et cet era , et cet era .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Uh , right , right , right .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : Um , for now I ’m gonna say like " profile " ’s oft en used
[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : like t wo uses t hat com e t o m ind im m ediat ely .
fe004 [ s] : One is in t he t radit ional like sem ant ic highlight of one
elem ent wit h respect t o everyt hing else .
fe004 [ s^ e] : So " hypot enuse " , you profiled t his guy against t he
background of t he [ pause] right t right t riangle .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s] : And t he second use , um , is in Fram eNet . It ’s
fe004 [ s^ rt ] : slight ly different .
fe004 [ s] : Oh , I was asking Hans about t his .
fe004 [ s] : They use it t o really m ean , um , t his [ disfm arker] in a fram e
t h t his is [ disfm arker] t he profiles on t he [ disfm arker] t hese are t he
ones t hat are required .
fe004 [ s] : So t hey have t o be t here or expressed in som e way .
fe004 [ s] : Which [ disfm arker] which [ disfm arker] I ’m not saying one
and t wo are m ut ually exclusive
fe004 [ s] : but t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re different m eanings .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : So t he closest t hing [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : so I was t hinking about how it relat es t o t his not at ion .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : For us , um [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ fg|qw^ t 1.%−−] : OK , so how is it [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−] : so " designat e " [ disfm arker] Fram eNet ?
m e010 [ qy .%−] : Does t hat [ disfm arker] Is t hat really what t hey m ean in
[ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qy ^ 2^ bu^ d] : Fram eNet ?
m e010 [ s^ e] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e010 [ s^ no] : I didn’t know t hat .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
fe004 [ s^ ba] : I [ disfm arker] I m ean , I [ disfm arker] I was a lit t le bit
surprised about it t oo .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : I knew t hat [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : I t hought t hat t hat would be som et hing like [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : t here ’s anot her t erm t hat I ’v e heard for t hat t hing

m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right , OK .
fe004 [ s] : but t hey [ disfm arker] I m ean [ disfm arker] uh , well , at least
Hans say s t hey use it t hat way .
fe004 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ cc] : Well , I ’ll check .
fe004 [ s] : and m ay m aybe he ’s wrong .
fe004 [ fg] : Any way , so
fe004 [ s^ t c|qy^ d^ f^ g] : I t hink t he [ disfm arker] t he " designat e " t hat
we have in t erm s of m eaning is really t he " highlight t his t hing wit h
respect t o everyt hing else " . OK ?
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe004 [ s] : So t his is what [ disfm arker] what it m eans .
fe004 [ s] : But t he second one seem s t o be useful
fe004 [ s^ rt ] : but we m ight not need a not at ion for it ?
fe004 [ s] : We don’t have a not at ion for it
fe004 [ s] : but we m ight want one .
fe004 [ s:s] : So for exam ple we ’ve t alked about if you ’re t alking about
t he lexical it em " walk " ,
fe004 [ s] : you know it ’s an act ion .
fe004 [ s] : Well , it also has t his idea [ disfm arker] it carries along wit h
it t he idea of an act or
fe004 [ s] : or som ebody ’s gonna do t he walking .
fe004 [ s:s] : Or if you t alk about an adject ive " red " , it carries along
t he idea of t he t hing t hat has t he propert y of having color red .
fe004 [ s^ rt :s] : So we used t o use t he not at ion " wit h " for t his
fe004 [ s] : and I t hink t hat ’s closest t o t heir second one .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s] : So I d don’t yet know , I have no com m it m ent , as t o
whet her we need it .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : It m ight be [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ cs^ rt .%−−] : it ’s t he kind of t hing t hat w a parser m ight want
t o t hink about whet her we require [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : you know , t hese t hings are like it ’s sem ant ically part of it
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ ar] : N no , no .
m e010 [ s^ nd] : Well , uh , t h crit ically t hey ’re not required synt act ically
.
m e010 [ s^ e] : Oft en t hey ’re pres presu presupposed and all t hat sort
of st uff .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Right , right . Yeah , um , definit ely .
fe004 [ fh] : So , um ,
fe004 [ s:s] : " in " was a good exam ple .
fe004 [ qh^ df^ e] : If you walk " in " , like well , in what ?
fe004 [ s.%−−] : You know , like you have t o have t he [ disfm arker]
[ com m ent ] So [ disfm arker] so it ’s only sem ant ically is it [ disfm arker]

m e010 [ s^ aa|%−] : Right , t here ’s [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : it is st ill required , say , by sim ulat ion t im e t hough
fe004 [ s^ e] : t o have som et hing .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe004 [ s] : So it ’s t hat [ disfm arker] I m eant t he idea of like t hat
[ disfm arker] t he sem ant ic value is filled in by sim sim ulat ion .
fe004 [ s^ no^ rt ] : I don’t know if t hat ’s som et hing we need t o spa t o
[ disfm arker] t o like say ever as part of t he requirem ent ? [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bsc^ rt ] : or t he const ruct ion ?
fe004 [ s^ e] : or not .
fe004 [ s] : We ’ll [ disfm arker] we ’ll again defer .
m e010 [ %−−] : Or [ disfm arker] I m ean , or [ disfm arker] or , uh
m e010 [ %−] : so t he [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bu] : Have it const rued ,
fe004 [ qy ^ rt ] : is t hat t he idea ?
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
fe004 [ s] : Just point at Robert .
fe004 [ s] : Whenever I ’m confused just point t o him .
m e010 [ s^ aa^ j] : Right .
fe004 [ s] : You t ell m e .
m e010 [ s^ j|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s his t hesis , right ?
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ fg] : Anyway ,
m e010 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : right , yeah , w t his is gonna be a b
m e010 [ s] : y ou ’re right , t his is a bit of in a m ess
m e010 [ s] : and we st ill have em phasis as well , or st ress , or what ever
.
fe004 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , well we ’ll get , uh uh , I [ disfm arker] we have
t hought s about t hose as well .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : Great .
fe004 [ fh] : Um ,
fe004 [ s.%−−] : t he I w I would just
fe004 [ s] : s som e of t his is just like m y [ disfm arker] you know , by fiat .
fe004 [ s] : I ’m going t o say , t his is how we use t hese t erm s .
fe004 [ s] : I don’t − y ou know , t here ’s lot s of different ways in t he
world t hat people use it .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : I [ disfm arker] t hat ’s fine .
fe004 [ s] : I t hink t hat , um , t he ot her t erm s t hat are relat ed are like
focus and st ress .
fe004 [ %−−] : So , s
m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : I t hink t hat t he way I [ disfm arker] we would like t o t hink ,
uh , I t hink is focus is som et hing t hat com es up in , I m ean , lot s of
[ disfm arker]

fe004 [ s] : basically t his is t he inform at ion st ruct ure .
fe004 [ s] : OK , it ’s like [ disfm arker] uh , it ’s not [ disfm arker] it m ight
be t hat t here ’s a synt act ic , uh , device t hat you use t o indicat e focus
m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : or t hat t here are t hings like , you know ,
fe004 [ s] : I t hink Keit h was t elling m e , [ com m ent ] t hings t oward t he
end of t he sent ence , post − verbal , t end t o be t he focused
[ disfm arker] focused elem ent ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm m .
fe004 [ s^ e] : t he new inform at ion .
fe004 [ s:s] : You know , if I [ disfm arker] " I walked int o t he room " , you
[ disfm arker] t end t o t hink t hat , what ev er , " int o t he room " is sort of
like t he m ore focused kind of t hing .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : And when you , uh , uh , you have st ress on som et hing t hat
m ight be , y ou know , a cue t hat t he st ressed elem ent , or for inst ance
, t he negat ed elem ent is kind of relat ed t o inform at ion st ruct ure .
fe004 [ s] : So t hat ’s like t he new [ disfm arker] t he sort of like im port or
what ev er of [ disfm arker] of t his t hing .
fe004 [ s] : Uh , so [ disfm arker] so I t hink t hat ’s kind of nice t o keep "
focus " being an inform at ion st ruct ure t erm .
fe004 [ %−−] : " St ress " [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : I t h and t hen t here are different kinds of focus t hat you can
bring t o it .
fe004 [ fh|s] : So , um , like " st ress " , t h st ress is kind of a pun on
[ disfm arker] you m ight have like [ disfm arker] what ever , like , um ,
accent kind of st ress .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : And t hat ’s just a [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : uh , w we ’ll want t o dist inguish st ress as a form device .
fe004 [ s^ e] : You know , like , oh , high volum e or what ever .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ fh] : Um ,
fe004 [ s] : t uh , and dist inguish t hat from it ’s effect
fe004 [ s:s|s^ f] : which is , " Oh , t he kind of focus we have is we ’re
em phasizing t his value oft en as opposed t o ot her values " , right ?
fe004 [ s] : So focus carries along a scope .
fe004 [ s] : Like if y ou ’re gonna focus on t his t hing and you wanna
know [ disfm arker] it sort of ev okes all t he ot her possibilit ies t hat it
wasn’t .
fe004 [ s:qy^ rt ] : Um , so m y classic [ disfm arker] m y now − classic
ex am ple of say ing , " Oh , he did go t o t he m eet ing ? " ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .

fe004 [ s^ rt :qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : t hat was m y way of saying [ disfm arker] as
opposed t o , y ou know , " Oh , he didn’t g " or " There was a m eet ing ?
"
fe004 [ s] : I t hink t hat was t he ex am ple t hat was caught on by t he
linguist s im m ediat ely .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : And so , um , t he [ disfm arker] like if you said he
[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−−] : you know , t here ’s all t hese different t hings t hat if you
put st ress on a different part of it t hen y ou ’re , c focusing , what ever ,
on , uh [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s:s] : " he walked t o t he m eet ing " as opposed t o " he ran " ,
fe004 [ s:s|s^ f] : or " he did walk t o t he m eet ing " as opposed t o " he
didn’t walk " . You know ,
m e045 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ cs] : so we need t o have a not at ion for t hat
fe004 [ %−−] : which , um ,
fe004 [ s] : I t hink t hat ’s st ill in progress .
fe004 [ s^ e] : So , sort of I ’m st ill working it out .
fe004 [ s] : But it did [ disfm arker] one [ disfm arker] one im plicat ion it
does f hav e for t he ot her side , which we ’ll get t o in a m inut e is t hat I
couldn’t t hink of a good way t o say " here are t he possible t hings t hat
y ou could focus on " ,
fe004 [ s^ df] : cuz it seem s like any ent it y in any sent ence , you know ,
or any m eaning com ponent of anyt h y ou know [ disfm arker] all t he
possible m eanings you could have , any of t hem could be t he subject
of focus .
m e010 [ b] : Mm m .
fe004 [ s|qy^ d^ f^ g] : But I t hink one [ disfm arker] t he one t hing you
can schem at ize is t he kind of focus , right ?
fe004 [ s|s^ f] : So for inst ance , you could say it ’s t he [ disfm arker] t he
t ense on t his as opposed t o , um , t he [ disfm arker] t he act ion . OK .
fe004 [ s] : Or it ’s [ disfm arker] uh , it ’s an ident it y t hing or a cont rast
wit h ot her t hings ,
fe004 [ s^ e] : or st ress t his value as opposed t o ot her t hings .
fe004 [ fh] : So , um ,
fe004 [ s] : it ’s [ disfm arker] it is kind of like a profile [ disfm arker] profile
− background t hing
fe004 [ s.%−−] : but I [ disfm arker] I can’t t hink of like t he lim it ed set of
possible m eanings t hat you would [ disfm arker] t hat you would focu
m e045 [ s^ 2|s^ aa] : Light up wit h focus , yeah .
fe004 [ s^ m ^ na] : light [ disfm arker] highlight
fe004 [ s^ e] : as opposed t o ot her ones .

fe004 [ s] : So it has som e cert ain com plicat ions for t he , uh , uh
[ disfm arker] lat er on .
fe004 [ s] : Li − I m ean , uh , t he best t hing I can com e up wit h is t hat
inform at ion has a list of focused elem ent s .
fe004 [ s] : For inst ance , you [ disfm arker] Oh , one ot her t ype t hat I
forgot t o m ent ion is like query elem ent s
fe004 [ s:qw] : and t hat ’s probably relevant for t he like " where is " ,
y ou know , " t he cast le " kind of t hing ?
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ df:s^ no] : Because you m ight want t o say t hat , um , locat ion
or cert cert ain WH words bring [ disfm arker] you know , sort of
aut om at ically focus in a , you know , " I don’t know t he ident it y of t his
t hing " kind of way on cert ain elem ent s .
fe004 [ fh] : So .
fe004 [ fg|s^ rt ] : OK . Anyway . So t hat ’s onl t here are [ disfm arker]
t here are m any m ore t hings t hat are uncl t hat are sort of like a lit t le
bit unst able about t he not at ion
fe004 [ s] : but it ’s m ost [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] t his is ,
y ou know , t he current [ disfm arker] current form .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : Ot her t hings we didn’t [ v ocalsound] t ot ally deal wit h ,
um ,
fe004 [ s] : well , we ’ve had a lot of ot her st uff t hat Keit h and I have
t hem working on in t erm s of like how you deal wit h like an adject ive .
m e045 [ s^ ba] : Oh , t here ’s a bunch .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : You know , a [ disfm arker] a nom inal expression .
fe004 [ fh] : And , um ,
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ cs] : I m ean , we should have put an exam ple of t his
fe004 [ s^ cs] : and we could do t hat lat er .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : But I t hink t he not inherent ly like t he general principles st ill
work t hough ,
fe004 [ s.%−−] : t hat , um , we can hav e const ruct ions t hat have sort of
const it uent st ruct ure in t hat t here is like , you know , for inst ance ,
one [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s|qy^ d^ f^ g] : Uh , you know , t hey [ disfm arker] t hey have
const it uent s , right ?
fe004 [ s] : So you can like nest t hings when you need t o ,
fe004 [ s] : but t hey can also overlap in a sort of flat t er way .
fe004 [ s] : So if you don’t have like a lot of gram m ar experience , t hen
like t his [ disfm arker] t his m ight , y ou know , be a lit t le o opaque .
fe004 [ s] : But , y ou know , we have t he [ pause] propert ies of
dependency gram m ars and som e propert ies of const it uent s
[ disfm arker] const it uent − based gram m ar .

fe004 [ s] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat ’s sort of t he m ain t hing
we want ed t o aim for
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : and so far it ’s worked out OK .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : Good .
fe004 [ fh] : So .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s.%−] : I can say t wo t hings about t he f
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yes .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : Maybe you want t o forget st ress .
m n015 [ s.%−] : This [ disfm arker] m y f
fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : As a word ?
m n015 [ s^ ar|s^ cs] : No , as [ disfm arker] as [ disfm arker] Just don’t
[ disfm arker] don’t t hink about it .
fe004 [ %−−] : As a [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qw^ j] : What ’s t hat ?
fe004 [ s^ fa] : Sorry .
m n015 [ %−] : If [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : canonically speaking you can [ disfm arker] if you look at a
[ disfm arker] a curve over sent ence , you can find out where a cert ain
st ress is
m n015 [ s] : and say , " hey , t hat ’s m y focus exponent . "
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s] : It doesn’t t ell you any t hing what t he focus is .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s.%−] : If it ’s just t hat t hing ,
fe004 [ s] : Or t he const it uent t hat it falls in .
m n015 [ s] : a lit t le bit m ore or t he whole phrase .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ %−] : Um [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : You m ean t forget about st ress , t he form cue ?
m n015 [ s^ na] : The form bit
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ df] : because , uh , as a form cue , um , not even t rained
ex pert s can always [ disfm arker] well , t hey can t ell you where t he focus
ex ponent is som et im es .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : And t hat ’s also m ost ly t rue for read speech .
m n015 [ s] : In [ disfm arker] in real speech , um , people m ay put st ress
.
m n015 [ s] : It ’s so d cont ext dependent on what was t here before ,
phrase ba breaks , um , rest art s .
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : It ’s just , um [ disfm arker]

m n015 [ s^ ba] : it ’s absurd .
m n015 [ s^ e] : It ’s com plicat ed .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e045 [ fg|s^ cs] : Yeah , I m ean , I [ disfm arker] I ’m sort of inclined t o
say let ’s worry about specifying t he inform at ion st ruct ure focus of t he
sent ence
m n015 [ %−] : And all [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ na|s^ bk] : I believe you , yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s.%−] : and t hen ,
fe004 [ s^ 2.%−−] : Ways t hat you can get it com e from t h
m e045 [ s] : hhh , [ com m ent ] t he phonology com ponent can handle
act ually assigning an int onat ion cont our t o t hat .
fe004 [ b] : right .
m e045 [ s.%−] : You know , I m ean , lat er on we ’ll worry about exact ly
how [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ bu] : Or [ disfm arker] or m ap from t he cont our t o
[ disfm arker] t o what t he focus exponent is .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : y Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Ex act ly .
m e045 [ s.%−−] : But figure out how t he [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : But , uh , if you don’t know what you ’re [ disfm arker] what
y ou ’re focus is t hen y ou ’re [ disfm arker] y ou ’re hopeless − uh − ly lost
anyway s ,
fe004 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ ba|s^ bk] : That ’s fine , yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : and t he only way of figuring out what t hat is , [ vocalsound]
is , um , by sort of generat ing all t he possible alt ernat ives t o each
focused elem ent , decide which one in t hat cont ext m akes sense and
which one doesn’t .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : And t hen you ’re left wit h a couple t hree .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : So , you know , again , t hat ’s som et hing t hat h hum ans
can do ,
m n015 [ s] : um , but far out side t he scope of [ disfm arker] of any
[ disfm arker] any t hing .
m n015 [ fh] : So .
m n015 [ fh] : You know .
m n015 [ %−−] : It ’s [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : OK . Well , uh , yeah , I wouldn’t have assum ed t hat
it ’s an easy problem in [ disfm arker] in absence of all t he ot h
m n015 [ %−] : u u

fe004 [ s^ e] : you need all t he ot her inform at ion I guess .
m n015 [ s] : But it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] what it [ disfm arker]
uh , it ’s pret t y easy t o put it in t he form alism , t hough .
m n015 [ s^ df.%−] : I m ean , because
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : you can just say what ev er st uff , " i is t he cont ainer being
focused or t he [ disfm arker] t he ent ire what ever , bot h , and so fort h . "
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m , m m − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah . Exact ly . So t he sort of effect of it is som et hing
we want t o be able t o capt ure .
m e010 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , so b b but I t hink t he poi
m e010 [ s^ bd^ df^ no] : I ’m not sure I underst and
m e010 [ s] : but here ’s what I t h t hink is going on .
m e010 [ s] : That if we do t he const ruct ions right when a part icular
const ruct ion m at ches , it [ disfm arker] t he fact t hat it m at ches , does
in fact specify t he focus .
fe004 [ %−−] : W uh ,
fe004 [ s^ no] : I ’m not sure about t hat .
fe004 [ s] : Or it m ight lim it [ disfm arker] it cert cert ainly const rains t he
possibilit ies of focus .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ na.%−] : Uh [ disfm arker] k uh , at at t he very least it const rai
fe004 [ s] : I t hink t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s , t h t hat ’s cert ainly t rue .
fe004 [ s^ bu|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : And depending on t he const ruct ion it m ay or
m ay not f specify t he focus , right ?
m e010 [ s^ na|s^ aa] : Oh , uh , for sure , yes .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : There are const rai yeah , it ’s not every [ disfm arker]
but t here are const ruct ions , uh , where you t explicit ly t ake int o
account t hose considerat ions
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : t hat you need t o t ake int o account in order t o decide
which [ disfm arker] what is being focused .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : So we t alked about t hat a lit t le bit t his m orning .
m n015 [ s:s] : " John is on t he bus ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s:s] : not Nancy . "
fe004 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ s] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker] focuses on John .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s:s] : " John is on t he bus and not on t he t rain . "
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ b] : Right .

m n015 [ s:s] : " John is on t he bus " versus " John is on t he t rain . "
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s.%−] : And " John is on t he bus " versus " was " , and e
fe004 [ s^ 2] : Is on .
fe004 [ s^ na] : " John is on t he bus " .
m n015 [ s.%−] : " it ’s t he bu " so e
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , all [ disfm arker] all of t hose .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s^ m ^ na] : All of t hese
m n015 [ qy.%−−] : and will we have [ disfm arker] u
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ] : is it all t he sam e const ruct ions ?
m n015 [ s^ e] : Just wit h a different foc focus const it uent ?
fe004 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : Yeah , I would say t hat argum ent st ruct ure in
t erm s of like t he m ain like sort of ,
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ no] : I don’t know [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : t he fact t hat you can get it wit hout any st ress and you have
som e [ disfm arker] what ever is predicat ed anyway should be t he sam e
set of const ruct ions .
fe004 [ s^ rt ] : So t hat ’s why I was t alking about overlapping
const ruct ions .
fe004 [ s] : So , t hen y ou have a separat e t hing t hat picks out , you
know , st ress on som et hing relat ive t o everyt hing else .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So , t he quest ion is act ually [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−] : And it would [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ fa] : oh , I ’m sorry ,
fe004 [ b] : y eah ,
m e010 [ s^ co] : go ahead ,
m e010 [ s^ co] : finish .
fe004 [ s] : and it w and t hat would hav e t o [ disfm arker] uh it m ight be
am biguous as , uh , whet her it picks up t hat elem ent , or t he phrase ,
or som et hing like t hat .
fe004 [ s] : But it ’s st ill is lim it ed possibilit y .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
fe004 [ s] : So t hat should , you know , int eract wit h [ disfm arker] it
should ov erlap wit h what ever ot her const ruct ion is t here .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ qh] : S s t he quest ion is , do we have a way on t he ot her page
, uh , when we get t o t he s sem ant ic side , of saying what t he st ressed
elem ent was , or st ressed phrase , or som et hing .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

fe004 [ s.%−−] : Well , so t hat ’s why I was saying how [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ rt ] : since I couldn’t t hink of an easy like lim it ed way of doing
it , um , all I can say is t hat inform at ion st ruct ure has a focused slot
m e010 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s.%−] : and I t hink t hat should be able t o refer t o [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : So t hat ’s down at t he bot t om here when we get over
t here .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s] : and , infer [ disfm arker] and I don’t have [ disfm arker] I don’t
have a great way or great exam ples
m e010 [ s^ cc] : I ’ll − I ’ll wait .
fe004 [ s] : but I t hink t hat [ disfm arker] som et hing like t hat is probably
gonna be , uh , m ore [ disfm arker] m ore what we have t o do .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
fe004 [ fh] : But , um ,
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ fh] : So
fe004 [ fg|s] : OK , t hat was one com m ent .
fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : And you had anot her one ?
m n015 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , well t he [ disfm arker] once you know what t he
focus is t he [ disfm arker] everyt hing else is background .
m n015 [ qh] : How about " t opic − com m ent "
m n015 [ s] : t hat ’s t he ot her side of inform at ion .
fe004 [ qw^ br^ rt ] : How about what ?
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : Topic − com m ent .
fe004 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , so t hat was t he ot her t hing .
fe004 [ s] : And so I didn’t realize it before .
fe004 [ s:s] : It ’s like , " oh ! " It was an epiphany t hat it [ disfm arker]
y ou know , t opic and focus are a cont rast set .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : So t opic is [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s|qy^ d^ g] : Topic − focused seem s t o m e like , um , background
profile , OK ,
fe004 [ s] : or a landm ark t raject or , or som e som et hing like t hat .
fe004 [ s] : There ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s definit ely , um , t hat kind of
t hing going on .
m n015 [ b] : Mm m .
fe004 [ s^ no.%−−] : Now I don’t know whet her [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : I n I don’t have as m any great exam ples of like t opic −
indicat ing const ruct ions
fe004 [ s^ e|qy^ d^ g] : on like focus , right ?
fe004 [ s] : Um , t opic [ disfm arker] it seem s kind of [ disfm arker] you
know , I t hink t hat m ight be an ongoing kind of t hing .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s] : Japanese has t his t hough .

fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : Topic m arker ?
m e045 [ s.%−−] : You know .
m e045 [ s^ aa|s:s] : Yeah , t hat ’s what " wa " is ,
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s^ e] : uh , just t o m ark which t hing is t he t opic .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s] : It doesn’t always have t o be t he subject .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s] : So again , inform at ion st ruct ure has a t opic slot .
fe004 [ s] : And , y ou know , I st uck it in t hinking t hat we m ight use it .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : Um , I t hink I st uck it in .
m e010 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yep , it ’s t here .
fe004 [ fh] : Um , and
fe004 [ s] : one t hing t hat I didn’t do consist ent ly , um , is [ disfm arker]
when we get t here , is like indicat e what kind of t hing fit s int o every
role .
fe004 [ s] : I t hink I have an idea of what it should be
fe004 [ %−−] : but t h
fe004 [ s] : you know , so far we ’ve been get t ing away wit h like eit her a
t y pe const raint or , um , you know , what ever .
fe004 [ s^ rt ] : I forg it ’ll be a fram e .
fe004 [ s] : You know , it ’ll be [ disfm arker] it ’ll be anot her predicat ion
or it ’ll be , um , I don’t know , som e value from [ disfm arker] from som e
som et hing , som e v ariable and scope or som et hing like t hat ,
fe004 [ s] : or a slot chain based on a variable and scope .
fe004 [ fg|s^ t c.%−−] : OK , so well t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qy ^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : should we flip over t o t he ot her side officially t hen
?
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m , hm m .
fe004 [ s] : I keep , uh , like , point ing forward t o it .
m e045 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , side one .
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : Now we ’ll go back t o s
fe004 [ fg|s] : OK , so t his doesn’t include som et hing which m i m i m ay
have som e effect on [ disfm arker] on it ,
fe004 [ s] : which is , um , t he discourse sit uat ion cont ext record ,
fe004 [ s^ f|s] : right ? So I didn’t [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I m eant just
like draw a line
fe004 [ s] : and like , you know , you also have , uh , som e t racking of
what was going on .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ bd] : And sort of [ disfm arker] t his is a big scale com m ent
before I , you know , look int o t he det ails of t his .

fe004 [ s.%−−] : But for inst ance you could im agine inst ead of having
[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ rt ] : I [ disfm arker] I changed t he nam e of [ disfm arker] um it
used t o be " ent it ies " .
fe004 [ s] : So you see it ’s " scenario " , " referent " and " discourse
segm ent " .
fe004 [ s] : And " scenario " is essent ially what kind of [ disfm arker] what
’s t he basic predicat ion ,
fe004 [ s^ e] : what event happened .
fe004 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : And act ually it ’s just a list of various slot s
from which y ou would draw [ disfm arker] draw in order t o paint your
pict ure , a bunch of fram es , bi and bindings , right ?
fe004 [ s] : Um , and obviously t here are ot her ones t hat are not
included here ,
fe004 [ s.%−−] : general cult ural fram es and general like , uh , ot her
act ion f
fe004 [ s] : y ou know , specific X − schem a fram es .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ bk|s^ bd] : OK , what ever .
fe004 [ s] : The m iddle t hing used t o be " ent it ies "
fe004 [ s^ df] : because you could im agine it should be like really a list
fe004 [ s] : where here was various inform at ion .
fe004 [ s] : And t his is int ended t o be gram m at ically specifiable
inform at ion about a referent [ disfm arker] uh , you know , about som e
ent it y t hat you were going t o t alk about .
fe004 [ s:s] : So " Harry walked int o t he room " ,
fe004 [ s] : " Harry " and " room " ,
fe004 [ s.%−−] : y ou know , t he room [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : t h but t hey would be represent ed in t his list som ehow .
fe004 [ s] : And it could also have for inst ance , it has t his cat egory slot
.
fe004 [ s] : Um , it should be eit her cat egory or in or inst ance .
fe004 [ s] : Basically , it could be a point er t o ont ology .
fe004 [ s] : So t hat everyt hing you know about t his could be
[ disfm arker] could be drawn in .
fe004 [ s] : But t he im port ant t hings for gram m at ical purposes are for
[ disfm arker] t hings like num ber , gender ,
fe004 [ s] : um [ disfm arker] ki t he ones I included here are slight ly
arbit rary
fe004 [ s.%−−] : but you could im agine t hat , um , you need t o figure out
whet h
fe004 [ s] : if it ’s a group whet her , um , som e event is happening ,
fe004 [ s] : linear t im e , linear spaces ,
fe004 [ s] : like , y ou know , are [ disfm arker] are t hey doing som et hing
serially
fe004 [ s.%−−] : or is it like ,

fe004 [ fh|s^ no] : um , uh I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m not sure .
fe004 [ s^ df] : Because t his part ly cam e from , uh , Talm y ’s schem a
fe004 [ s] : and I ’m not sure we ’ll need all of t hese act ually .
fe004 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : Um , and t hen t he " st at us " I used was like , again , in
som e languages , you know , like for inst ance in child language you
m ight dist inguish bet ween different st at us .
fe004 [ s] : So , t h t he [ disfm arker] t he big com and [ disfm arker] and
finally " discourse segm ent " is about [ vocalsound] sort of speech − act
− y inform at ion st ruct ure − y ,
fe004 [ s] : like ut t erance − specific kinds of t hings .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : So t he com m ent I was going t o m ake about , um ,
changing ent it y [ disfm arker] t he ent it y ’s block t o reference is t hat
[ v ocalsound] you can im agine your discourse
fe004 [ s^ e.%−−] : like sit uat ion cont ext ,
fe004 [ s] : y ou hav e a set of ent it ies t hat y ou ’re sort of referring t o .
fe004 [ s] : And y ou m ight [ disfm arker] t hat m ight be sort of a general ,
I don’t know , dat abase of all t he t hings in t his discourse t hat you
could refer t o .
fe004 [ s] : And I changed t o " reference "
fe004 [ s] : cuz I would say , for a part icular ut t erance you have
part icular referring ex pressions in it .
fe004 [ s] : And t hose are t he ones t hat you get inform at ion about t hat
y ou st ick in here .
fe004 [ s] : For inst ance , I know it ’s going t o be plural .
fe004 [ s] : I know it ’s gonna be fem inine or som et hing like t hat .
fe004 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : And [ disfm arker] and t hese could act ually just
point t o , y ou know , t he [ disfm arker] t he ID in m y ot her list of ent i
act ive ent it ies , right ?
fe004 [ fh] : So , um ,
fe004 [ s] : uh , t h t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s all t his st uff about
discourse st at us . We ’ve t alked about .
fe004 [ s] : I alm ost list ed " discourse st at us " as a slot where you could
say it ’s act iv e .
fe004 [ s] : You know , t here ’s t his , um , hierarchy [ disfm arker] uh
t here ’s a schem at izat ion of , y ou know , t hings can be act ive or t hey
can be , um , accessible , inaccessible .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : It was t he one t hat , you know , Keit h , um , em ailed t o us
once , t o som e of us ,
fe004 [ s] : not all of us .
fe004 [ fh] : And
fe004 [ s] : t he t hing is t hat t hat [ disfm arker] I not iced t hat t hat , um ,
list was sort of discourse dependent .
fe004 [ s] : It was like in t his part icular set , s you know , inst ance , it
has been referred t o recent ly or it hasn’t been ,

m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : or t his is som et hing t hat ’s like in m y world knowledge but
not act iv e .
m e010 [ %−−] : This [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ fg|s] : Uh [ disfm arker] y eah , well t here [ disfm arker] t here
seem s t o be cont ex t propert ies .
fe004 [ fh] : So .
fe004 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , t hey ’re cont ex and for inst ance , I used t o
have a locat ion t hing t here
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : but act ually t hat ’s a propert y of t he sit uat ion .
fe004 [ s] : And it ’s again , t im e , you know [ disfm arker] at cert cert ain
point s t hings are locat ed , you know , near or far from you
m e010 [ s^ nd] : Well , uh , uh , t his is recursive
fe004 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ df.%−−] : cuz unt il we do t he uh , m ent al space st ory , we ’re
not quit e sure [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] Th − t h
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : which is fine .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah .
m e010 [ s.%−] : We ’ll just [ disfm arker] we ’ll j
fe004 [ s.%−] : So som e of t hese are , uh [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ no] : we just don’t know yet .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe004 [ s|qy^ d^ g:s] : So I [ disfm arker] so for now I t hought , well m aybe
I ’ll just have in t his list t he t hings t hat are relevant t o t his part icular
ut t erance , right ?
fe004 [ s] : Ev ery t hing else here is ut t erance − specific .
fe004 [ s] : Um , and I left t he slot , " predicat ions " , open
fe004 [ s^ df] : because you can hav e , um , t hings like " t he guy I know
from school " .
fe004 [ s] : Or , y ou know , like your referring expression m ight be
const rained by cert ain like unbounded na am ount s of prep you know ,
predicat ions t hat you m ight m ake .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : And it ’s unclear whet her [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : I m ean , y ou could just have in your scenario , "
here are som e ext ra few t hings t hat are t rue " , right ?
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : And t hen you could just sort of not have t his slot
here . Right ?
fe004 [ s] : You ’re [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] but it ’s used for
ident ificat ion purposes .
fe004 [ s] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s a lit t le bit different from just saying
" all t hese t hings are t rue from m y ut t erance " .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ fh] : Um .
m e045 [ fg|s:s] : Right , " t his guy I know from school cam e for dinner "
does not m ean , um , " t here ’s a guy , I know him from school ,
m e045 [ s:s] : and he cam e over for dinner " .
m e045 [ s] : That ’s not t he sam e effect .
fe004 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , it ’s a lit t le bit [ disfm arker] it ’s a lit t le bit
different .
fe004 [ s^ f|%−−] : Right ? So [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−−] : Or m aybe t hat ’s like a rest rict ive , non − rest rict ive
[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−−] : you know , it ’s like it get s int o t hat kind of t hing for
[ disfm arker]
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : um , but m aybe I ’m m ix ing , you know [ disfm arker] t his is
kind of like t he final result aft er parsing t he sent ence .
fe004 [ s] : So y ou m ight im agine t hat t he inform at ion you pass t o , you
know [ disfm arker] in ident ifying a part icular referent would be , " oh ,
som e [ disfm arker] " y ou know , " it ’s a guy
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : and it ’s som eone I know from school " .
fe004 [ s] : So m aybe t hat would , you know , be som e int erm ediat e
st ruct ure t hat you would pass int o t he disc t o t he , what ever ,
const rual engine or what ever , discourse cont ext , t o find [ disfm arker]
y ou know , eit her creat e t his reference ,
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : in which case it ’d be creat ed here ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−−] : y ou know , so [ disfm arker] so you could im agine t hat
t his m ight not [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : So , uh , I ’m uncom m it t ed t o a couple of t hese t hings .
m n015 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] t o m ake it m precise at least in m y m ind ,
uh , it ’s not precise .
fe004 [ fh] : Um .
m n015 [ qw^ rt ] : So " house " is gender neut er ?
fe004 [ h|s.%−] : Um , it could be in [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : In realit y
m n015 [ qrr.%−] : or in [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : Sem ant ically .
fe004 [ s^ m ^ na|s^ aa] : sem ant ically , yeah . Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ bk^ m ] : sem ant ically .
m n015 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s:s] : So it uh , uh , a t able .
fe004 [ s] : You know , a t hing t hat c doesn’t have a gender .

fe004 [ fg|s.%−−] : So . Uh , it could be t hat [ disfm arker] I m ean ,
fe004 [ s.%−−] : m ay be you ’d [ disfm arker] m aybe not all t hese
[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : I m ean , I wou I would say t hat I t ried t o keep slot s here t hat
were pot ent ially relevant t o m ost [ disfm arker] m ost t hings .
m n015 [ s^ ar|s] : No , just t o m ake sure t hat we [ disfm arker] everybody
t hat ’s [ disfm arker] com plet ely agreed t hat it [ disfm arker] it has
not hing t o do wit h , uh , form .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ bk|s.%−] : OK , t hat is sem ant ic as opposed t o [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . Yeah . That ’s right .
fe004 [ fh] : Um .
fe004 [ %−] : S so again [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : Then " predicat ions " m akes sense t o [ disfm arker] t o have
it open for som et hing like , uh , accessibilit y or not .
fe004 [ s^ 2] : Open t o various t hings .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , so . Let ’s see .
fe004 [ qy ^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : So m aybe having m ade t hat big sca sort of like
large scale com m ent , should I just go t hrough each of t hese slot s
[ disfm arker] uh , each of t hese blocks , um , a lit t le bit ?
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
fe004 [ s] : Um , m ost ly t he t op one is sort of im age schem at ic .
fe004 [ s] : And just a not e ,
fe004 [ s.%−−] : which was t hat , um [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−−] : s so when we act ually ha
fe004 [ s.%−−] : so for inst ance , um ,
fe004 [ s|s^ f] : som e of t hem seem m ore inherent ly st at ic , OK ,
fe004 [ s] : like a cont ainer or sort of support − ish .
fe004 [ s] : And ot hers are a lit t le bit seem ingly inherent ly dynam ic
fe004 [ s] : like " source , pat h , goal " is oft en t hought of t hat way
fe004 [ s] : or " force " , or som et hing like t hat .
fe004 [ s] : But in act ual fact , I t hink t hat t hey ’re int ended t o be sort
of neut ral wit h respect t o t hat .
fe004 [ s] : And different X − schem as use t hem in a way t hat ’s eit her
st at ic or dy nam ic .
fe004 [ s] : So " pat h " , you could just be t alking about t he pat h
bet ween t his and t his .
m e045 [ b.%] : Mm m .
fe004 [ s] : And y ou know , " cont ainer " t hat you can go in and out .
fe004 [ s] : All of t hese t hings .
fe004 [ fh] : And so , um ,
fe004 [ s] : I t hink t his cam e up when , uh , Ben and I were working wit h
t he Spaniards , um , t he ot her day [ disfm arker]

fe004 [ s^ bsc] : t he " Spaniet t es " , as we [ vocalsound] called t hem
[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : um , t o decide like how you want t o split up , like , s im age
schem at ic cont ribut ions versus , like , X − schem at ic cont ribut ions .
fe004 [ qh^ e] : How do you link t hem up .
fe004 [ s] : And I t hink again , um , it ’s gonna be som et hing in t he X −
schem a t hat t ells y ou " is t his st at ic or is t his dynam ic " .
fe004 [ s^ cs] : So we definit ely need [ disfm arker] t hat sort of aspect ual
t y pe giv es y ou som e of t hat .
fe004 [ fg|s] : Um , t hat , you know , is it , uh , a st at e or is it a change
of st at e , or is it a , um , act ion of som e kind ?
m n015 [ qy ] : Uh , i i i is t here any m eaning t o when you have sort of
param et ers behind it and when y ou don’t ?
fe004 [ fh] : Uh .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n015 [ %−] : Just m eans [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk|qy ^ bu^ d] : Oh , oh ! You m ean , in t he slot ?
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ ar|s] : Um , no , it ’s like X − sc it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s like I was
t hinking of t ype const raint s
fe004 [ s] : but X − schem a , well it obviously has t o be an X − schem a .
fe004 [ s] : " Agent " , I m ean , t he [ disfm arker] t he perform er of t he X −
schem a ,
fe004 [ s] : t hat s depends on t he X − schem a .
fe004 [ s.%−] : You know , and I [ disfm arker] in general it would probably
be , y ou know [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ bu] : So t he difference is basically whet her you t hought it
was obvious what t he possible fillers were .
fe004 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , basically .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ bd] : Um , " aspect ual t y pe " probably isn’t obvious
fe004 [ s^ df.%−] : but I should hav e [ disfm arker] So , I just neglect ed t o
st ick som et hing in . " Perspect ive " , " act or " , " undergoer " , "
observer " , um ,
m e003 [ b] : Mm m .
fe004 [ s.%−] : I t hink we ’ve oft en used " agent " , " pat ient " , obser
m e045 [ s^ fe] : " Whee ! "
m e045 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g] : That ’s t hat one , right ?
fe004 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , exact ly . [ vocalsound] Exact ly .
fe004 [ fh|s] : Um , and so one nice t hing t hat , uh , we had t alked
about is t his exam ple [ com m ent ] of like , if you have a passive
const ruct ion t hen one t hing it does is ch you know [ disfm arker]
definit ely , it is one way t o [ disfm arker] for y ou t o , you know ,
specifically t ake t he perspect ive of t he undergoing kind of object .

fe004 [ qh] : And so t hen we t alked about , you know , whet her well ,
does t hat specify t opic as well ?
fe004 [ s] : Well , m aybe t here are ot her t hings .
fe004 [ s] : You know , now t hat it ’s [ disfm arker] subject is m ore like a
t opic .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : And now t hat , y ou know [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ fg|%−−] : Anyway . So .
fe004 [ s^ fa|s] : Sorry . I ’m gonna t rail off on t hat one
fe004 [ s^ df] : cuz it ’s not t hat f im port ant right now .
fe004 [ fh] : Um ,
m e010 [ s] : N now , for t he m om ent we just need t he abilit y t o l l writ e
it down if [ disfm arker] if som ebody figured out what t he rules were .
fe004 [ s^ 2.%−] : To know how [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . Yeah . Exact ly .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe004 [ fh] : Um ,
fe004 [ s.%−−] : som e of t hese ot her ones ,
fe004 [ s] : let ’s see .
fe004 [ fh] : So ,
fe004 [ s] : uh , one t hing I ’m uncert ain about is how polarit y int eract s
.
fe004 [ s] : So polarit y , uh , is using for like act ion did not t ake place
for inst ance .
m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : So by default it ’ll be like " t rue " , I guess ,
fe004 [ s] : you know , if you ’re specify ing event s t hat did happen .
fe004 [ s] : You could im agine t hat you skip out t his [ disfm arker] you
know , leav e off t his polarit y ,
fe004 [ s] : y ou know , not [ disfm arker] don’t have it here .
fe004 [ s] : And t hen have it part of t he speech − act in som e way .
m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : There ’s som e negat ion .
fe004 [ s] : But t he reason why I left it in is cuz you m ight have a
change of st at e , let ’s say , where som e st at e holds and t hen som e
st at e doesn’t hold ,
fe004 [ s.%−−] : and you ’re just t alking , you know [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−] : if you ’re t rying t o have t he nut s and bolt s of sim ulat ion
y ou need t o know t hat , you know , what ever , t he holder doesn’t and
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ ar|s] : No , I t h I t hink at t his lev which is [ disfm arker] it
should be where you have it .
fe004 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , it ’s [ disfm arker] so it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
[ disfm arker] it ’s fine where it is .
fe004 [ fh] : So ,
m e010 [ s^ e] : I m ean , how you get it m ay [ disfm arker] m ay in will
oft en involv e t he discourse

fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ 2] : May com e from a few places .
m e010 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] by t he t im e you ’re
sim ulat ing you sh y y ou should know t hat .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e045 [ s^ rt ] : So , [ vocalsound] I ’m st ill just really not clear on what I
’m looking at .
m e045 [ s^ rt ] : The " scenario " box ,
m e045 [ qh] : like , what does t hat look like for an exam ple ?
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s^ df] : Like , not all of t hese t hings are gonna be here .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Correct .
m e045 [ s.%−] : This is just basically say s
fe004 [ s.%−] : It ’s a grab bag of [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s] : " part of what I ’m going t o hand you is a whole bunch of s
uh , schem as , im age , and X − schem as .
m e045 [ s] : Here are som e exam ples of t he sort s of t hings you m ight
have in t here " .
fe004 [ s^ na] : So t hat ’s exact ly what it is .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s] : And for a part icular inst ance which I will , you know , m ake
an exam ple of som et hing , is t hat you m ight have an inst ance of
cont ainer and pat h , let ’s say , as part of your , you know , " int o " you
know , definit ion .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ rt ] : So y ou would event ually have inst ances filled in wit h
v arious [ disfm arker] v arious values for all t he different slot s .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : And t hey ’re bound up in , y ou know , t heir bindings and
[ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and values .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ %−−] : W it c
m e045 [ qy.%−−] : Do y ou have t o say about t he binding in your
[ disfm arker]
m e045 [ qy^ rt ] : is t here a slot in here for [ disfm arker] t hat t ells you
how t he bindings are done ?
m e010 [ s^ ar] : No , no , no .
m e010 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] let ’s see , I t hink we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re
not [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ no] : I don’t t hink we have it quit e right yet .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So , uh , what t his is ,
m e010 [ s] : let ’s suppose for t he m om ent it ’s com plet e .

m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : OK , uh , t hen t his says t hat when an analysis is finished ,
t he whole analysis is finished , [ com m ent ] you ’ll have as a result , uh ,
som e s result ing s sem spec for t hat ut t erance in cont ext ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : which is m ade up ent irely of t hese t hings and , uh ,
bindings am ong t hem .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ e] : And bindings t o ont ology it em s .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat t he who t hat t his is t he t ool kit
under whi out of which you can m ake a sem ant ic specificat ion .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : So t hat ’s A .
m e045 [ b] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : But B , which is m ore relevant t o your life , is t his is also
t he t ool kit t hat is used in t he sem ant ic side of const ruct ions .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So t his is an t hat anyt hing you have , in t he part y line ,
[ com m ent ] any t hing you have as t he sem ant ic side of const ruct ions
com es , from pieces of t his [ disfm arker] ignoring li
m e045 [ b] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : I m ean , in general , y ou ignore lot s of it .
m e045 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : But it ’s got t o be pieces of t his along wit h const raint s
am ong t hem .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : Uh , so t hat t he , y ou know , goal of t he , uh uh , " source ,
pat h , goal " has t o be t he landm ark of t he cont a you know , t he
int erior of t his cont ainer .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ e] : Or what e what ev er .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s] : So t hose const raint s appear in const ruct ions
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : but pret t y m uch t his is t he full range of sem ant ic
st ruct ures av ailable t o you .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ arp] : Ex cept for " cause " , t hat I forgot .
fe004 [ s] : But anyway , t here ’s som som e kind of causal st ruct ure for
com posit e event s .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : OK , good .
m e010 [ s^ co] : Let ’s [ disfm arker] let ’s m ark t hat .
m e010 [ s.%−] : So we need a c
fe004 [ s] : Uh , I m ean , so it get s a lit t le funny .

fe004 [ s] : These are all [ disfm arker] so far t hese st ruct ures ,
especially from " pat h " and on down , t hese are sort of relat ively
fam iliar , um , im age schem at ic kind of slot s .
fe004 [ s|qy ^ d^ g] : Now wit h " cause " , uh , t he fillers will act ually be
t hem selves fram es . Right ?
fe004 [ s] : So y ou ’ll say , " event one causes event B [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and
t his [ disfm arker] t his [ disfm arker] t his again m ay ge our , um
[ disfm arker] and we [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and , of course ,
worlds .
fe004 [ s.%−] : uh , ev ent t wo " ,
fe004 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah . So t hat ’s , uh t hese are all im plicit ly one
[ disfm arker] wit hin , uh wit hin one world .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ fh] : Um ,
fe004 [ s] : even t hough saying t hat place t akes place , what ever .
fe004 [ s] : Uh , if y if I said " t im e " is , you know , " past " , t hat would
say " set t hat t his world " , you know , " som ewhere , before t he world
t hat corresponds t o our current speech t im e " .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ fh|s] : So . But t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s sort of
OK .
fe004 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] wit hin t he ev ent it ’s st it
’s st ill one world .
fe004 [ fh] : Um .
fe004 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , so " cause " and [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : Ot her fram es t hat could com e in [ disfm arker] I m ean ,
unfort unat ely you could bring in say for inst ance , um , uh , " desire "
or som et hing like t hat ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ e] : like " want " .
fe004 [ s] : And act ually t here is right now under " discourse segm ent s
" , um , " at t it ude " ?
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ rt ] : " Volit ion " ?
fe004 [ s] : could fill t hat .
fe004 [ s^ rt ] : So t here are a couple t hings where I like , " oh , I ’m not
sure if I want ed t o have it t here
m e045 [ %−] : Well t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : or [ disfm arker] " Basically t here was a whole list of
[ disfm arker] of possible speaker at t it udes t hat like say Talm y list ed .

fe004 [ s] : And , like , well , I don’t [ disfm arker] you know , it was like "
hope , wish . desire " ,
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e045 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe004 [ s^ e] : blah − blah − blah .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : And it ’s like , well , I feel like if I want ed t o have an ext ra
m eaning [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ no] : I don’t know if t hose are gram m at ically m arked in t he
first place .
fe004 [ s|qy^ d^ f^ g] : So [ disfm arker] They ’re m ore lexically m arked ,
right ?
fe004 [ s^ e] : At least in English .
m e045 [ b] : Mm m .
fe004 [ s] : So if I want ed t o I would st ick in an ext ra fram e in m y
m eaning , saying ,
fe004 [ s|qy^ d^ f^ g] : e so t h it ’d be a hierarchical fram e t hem , right ?
fe004 [ s] : You know , like " Naom i want s [ disfm arker] want s su a
cert ain sit uat ion
fe004 [ s] : and t hat sit uat ion it self is a st at e of affairs " .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : S right .
m e010 [ s.%−] : So [ disfm arker] so , " want " it self can be [ disfm arker]
[ pause] i i i i i
fe004 [ %−] : u
fe004 [ s^ 2] : Can be just anot her fram e t hat ’s part of your
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : Well , and it i basically it ’s an act ion .
m e010 [ s^ e.%−] : In [ disfm arker] in our s in our [ disfm arker] in our
[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ 2|s^ aa] : Sit uat ion . [ com m ent ] Right , right .
m e010 [ s] : in [ disfm arker] in our [ disfm arker] in our s t erm inology , "
want " can be an act ion
m e010 [ s] : and " what you want " is a world .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ b] : Hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ s] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker] I m ean , it ’s cert ainly one way t o do
it .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ fh|s] : Yeah , t here [ disfm arker] t here are ot her t hings .
m e010 [ s] : Causal st uff we absolut ely need .
m e010 [ s] : Ment al space we need .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : The cont ext we need .
m e010 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um , so anyway , Keit h [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ qy ] : So is t his com fort able t o y ou

m e010 [ s^ e] : t hat , uh , once we have t his defined , it is your t ool kit
for building t he sem ant ic part of const ruct ions .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ e] : And t hen when we com bine const ruct ions sem ant ically ,
t he goal is going t o be t o fill out m ore and m ore of t he bindings
needed in order t o com e up wit h t he final one .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s] : And t hat ’s t he wh and [ disfm arker] and I m ean , t hat
[ disfm arker] according t o t he part y line , t hat ’s t he whole st ory .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e045 [ fh|%−−] : Um . y
m e045 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Right . That m akes sense .
m e045 [ s] : So I m ean , t here ’s t his st uff in t he [ disfm arker] off in t he
scenario ,
m e045 [ s] : which just t ells you how various [ disfm arker] what schem as
y ou ’re using
m e045 [ s] : and t hey ’re [ disfm arker] how t hey ’re bound t oget her .
m e045 [ s.%−−] : And I guess t hat som e of t he discourse segm ent st uff
[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ qy.%−−] : is t hat where you would sa
m e045 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , t hat ’s where t he inform at ion st ruct ure is
m e045 [ s] : which sort of is a kind of profiling on different part s of , um
, of t his .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Exact ly .
m e045 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , what ’s int erest ing is t hat t he inform at ion
st ruct ure st uff [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ ba] : Hm m .
m e045 [ s] : There ’s alm ost [ disfm arker] I m ean , we keep com ing back
t o how focus is like t his [ disfm arker] t his , uh , t raject or − landm ark
t hing .
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s:s] : So if I say , um , You know , " In France it ’s like t his " .
m e045 [ s] : You know , great ,
m e045 [ s^ e] : we ’v e learned som et hing about France
m e045 [ s] : but t he fact is t hat ut t erances of t hat sort are generally
used t o help y ou draw a conclusion also about som e im plicit cont rast ,
m e045 [ s:s] : like " In France it ’s like t his " .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m e045 [ s.%−−:s] : And t herefore y ou ’re supposed t o say , " Boy , life
sure [ disfm arker] "

m e045 [ s] : You know , " in France kids are allowed t o drink at age
t hree " .
m e045 [ s] : And w you ’re [ disfm arker] t hat ’s not just a fact about
France .
fe004 [ b] : Right , right .
m e045 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : You also conclude som et hing about how boring
it is here in t he U S . Right ?
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e045 [ fh] : And so [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bd^ cs^ rt ] : S so I would prefer not t o worry about t hat for
right now
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : and t o t hink t hat t here are , um ,
m e045 [ s] : That com es in
fe004 [ s.%−−] : discourse level const ruct ions in a sense , t opic
[ disfm arker] t opic − focus const ruct ions t hat would say , " oh , when
y ou focus som et hing " t hen [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ %−] : and , uh [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : just done t he sam e way [ disfm arker] just act ually in t he
sam e way as t he lower level .
fe004 [ s] : If you st ressed , you know , " John went t o t he [ disfm arker] "
, you know , " t he bar " what ever , you ’re focusing t hat
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : and a in a possible inference is " in cont rast t o ot her t hings
" .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : So sim ilarly for a whole sent ence , you know , " in France
such − and − such happens " .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah , yeah .
fe004 [ s] : So t he whole t hing is sort of like again im plicit ly as opposed
t o ot her t hings t hat are possible .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : Uh , just [ disfm arker] just , uh , look [ disfm arker] read uh
ev en sem sem i form al Mat s Root h .
fe004 [ %−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n015 [ s] : If you haven’t read it . It ’s nice .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : And just pick any paper on alt ernat ive sem ant ics .
fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : So t hat ’s his [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he best way of t alking
about focus , is I t hink his way .

m e045 [ s^ bk|qw^ rt ] : OK , what was t he nam e ?
m n015 [ s] : Mat s .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : MATS .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : Root h .
m n015 [ s] : I t hink t wo O ’s ,
m n015 [ s^ aa|s] : yes , TH .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : I nev er know how t o pronounce his nam e
m n015 [ s^ df.%−] : because he ’s sort of ,
m e010 [ qy ^ 2^ bu^ d] : S Swede ?
m n015 [ s] : uh , he is Dut ch
m e010 [ qw^ br^ m ] : Dut ch ?
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ m ] : Oh , Dut ch .
m n015 [ fh|s] : and , um [ disfm arker] but very confused background I
t hink .
m e010 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n015 [ fh] : So [ pause] and , um ,
m e045 [ s] : Mat s Gould .
m n015 [ s] : And sadly enough he also just left t he IMS in St ut t gart .
m n015 [ s] : So he ’s not t here anym ore .
m e045 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ fh] : But , um [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ no] : I don’t know where he is right now
m n015 [ s] : but alt ernat ive sem ant ics is [ disfm arker] if you t ype t hat
int o an , uh , uh , browser or search engine you ’ll get t ons of st uff .
m e045 [ b] : OK .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e045 [ s^ bk|s^ ft ] : OK , t hanks .
m n015 [ s^ t c] : And what I ’m kind of confused about is [ disfm arker] is
what t he speaker and t he hearer is [ disfm arker] is sort of doing t here .
fe004 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : So for a part icular segm ent it ’s really just a
reference t o som e ot her ent it y again in t he sit uat ion , right ?
fe004 [ s] : So for a part icular segm ent t he speaker m ight be you or
m ight be m e .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ ba] : Um , hearer is a lit t le bit harder .
fe004 [ s] : It could be like m ult iple people .
fe004 [ s] : I guess t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat ’s not very clear from here [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : I m ean , t hat ’s not allowed here .
m n015 [ s^ bk|qy] : Yeah , but you [ disfm arker] Don’t we ult im at ely want
t o handle t hat analogously t o t he way we handle t im e and place ,
m n015 [ s^ df] : because " you " , " m e " , " he " , " t hey " ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : y ou know , " t hese guy s " ,

m n015 [ s] : all t hese expressions , nuh , are in [ disfm arker] in m uch
t he sam e way cont ext ually dependent as " here , " and " now , " and "
t here " [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : Now , t his is [ disfm arker] t his is assum ing you ’ve already
solv ed t hat .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Ye − y eah .
m e010 [ s:s] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s Fred and Mary ,
fe004 [ %−] : So t h
m e010 [ s] : so t he speaker would be Fred
m e010 [ %−] : and t he [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ bk] : Ah !
fe004 [ s^ aa|s] : Right , so t he const ruct ions m ight [ disfm arker] of
course will refer , using pronouns or what ever .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : In which case t hey hav e t o check t o see , uh , who t he , uh ,
speaker in here wa in order t o resolve t hose .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : But when you act ually say t hat " he walked int o
[ disfm arker] " , what ever , um , t he " he " will refer t o a part icular
[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : You [ disfm arker] you will already have figured who " he " or "
y ou " , m m m , or " I " , m aybe is a bet t bet t er exam ple , who " I " refers
to .
fe004 [ s] : Um , and t hen you ’d just be able t o refer t o Harry , you
know , in wherev er t hat person [ disfm arker] what ever role t hat person
was play ing in t he event .
m n015 [ b] : Mm m .
m n015 [ s^ bu] : That ’s up at t he reference part .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
m n015 [ qw^ rt ] : And down t here in t he speaker − hearer part ?
fe004 [ s.%−−] : S so , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat ’s just [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ %−−] : n
fe004 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : for inst ance , Speaker is known from t he
sit uat ion , right ?
fe004 [ s] : You ’re [ disfm arker] when you hear som et hing you ’re t old
who t he speaker is [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : I m ean , y ou know who t he speaker is .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : In fact , t hat ’s kind of const raining how [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : in som e ways you know t his before you get t o t he
[ disfm arker] you fill in all t he rest of it .
fe004 [ s] : I t hink .
m e010 [ b] : Mm m .
fe004 [ qh^ df.%−] : I m ean , how else would you um [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s:s] : You know , uh , uh , it ’s [ disfm arker] t he speaker m ay
[ disfm arker] in English is allowed t o say " I . "
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .

m e010 [ %−] : Well , here [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ e] : Uh , am ong t he t went y − fiv e percent m ost used words .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n015 [ qh] : But wouldn’t t he " I " t hen set up t he [ disfm arker] t he s s
referent [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ e] : t hat happens t o be t he speaker t his t im e
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Right , right .
m n015 [ s^ e] : and not " t hey , " whoever t hey are .
fe004 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ %−−] : Or " you " [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s.%−] : m uch like t he " you " could n
fe004 [ fg|s] : S so [ disfm arker] OK , so I would say ref under referent
should be som et hing t hat corresponds t o " I " .
fe004 [ s] : And m aybe each referent should probably have a list of way
what ev er , t he way it was referred t o .
fe004 [ s] : So t hat ’s " I "
fe004 [ qh] : but , uh , uh , should we say it [ disfm arker] it refers t o ,
what ?
fe004 [ s:s] : Uh , if it were " Harry " it would refer t o like som e ont ology
t hing .
fe004 [ s:s] : If it were [ disfm arker] if it ’s " I " it would refer t o t he
current speaker ,
fe004 [ s] : OK , which is given t o be like , you know , whoever it is .
m n015 [ s^ nd] : Well , not [ disfm arker] not always .
m n015 [ s.%−:s.%−] : I m ean , so t here ’s " and t hen he said , I w " Uh −
huh .
fe004 [ s^ df:s] : " I " wit hin t he current world .
m e010 [ %−] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ na] : That ’s right .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
m e010 [ fg|s] : So [ disfm arker] so again , t his [ disfm arker] uh , t his
[ disfm arker] t his is gonna t o get us int o t he m ent al space st uff
m e010 [ s^ df:s] : and t because you know , " Fred said t hat Mary said
[ disfm arker] " , and what ever .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ s^ cs] : And [ disfm arker] and so we ’re , uh gonna have t o , um
, chain t hose as well .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ b] : Twhhh − whhh .
m n015 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

fe004 [ s] : So t his ent ire t hing is inside a world ,
m e010 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ e] : not just like t he t op part .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ %−−] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink , uh [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ %−−] : That ’s [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ arp] : Except s it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s t rickier t han t hat
m e010 [ s^ df.%−−] : because um , t he reference for exam ple
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So he where it get s really t ricky is t here ’s som e t hings
,
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : and t his is where blends and all t erribl
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s] : So , som e t hings which really are m eant t o be ident ified
and som e t hings which aren’t .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : And again , all we need for t he m om ent is som e way t o say
t hat .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s] : So I t hought of having like [ disfm arker] for each referent ,
having t he list of [ disfm arker] of t he t hings t wit h which it is ident ified .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : You know , which [ disfm arker] which , uh you know , you
[ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ am ] : You could do t hat .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : for inst ance , um [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−−] : So , I guess ,
fe004 [ s] : it sort of depends on if it is a referring exp if it ’s ident ifiable
already or it ’s a new t hing .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : If it ’s a new t hing you ’d hav e t o like creat e a st ruct ure or
what ev er .
fe004 [ s|s^ f] : If it ’s an old t hing it could be referring t o , um , usually
w som et hing in a sit uat ion , right ?
fe004 [ s^ e] : Or som et hing in ont ology .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : uh − huh .
fe004 [ fh] : So ,
fe004 [ s] : t here ’s a you know , what ever , it c it could point at one of
t hese .
m e010 [ s] : I just had a [ disfm arker] I just had an [ disfm arker] an idea
t hat would be very nice if it works .
fe004 [ qw^ br] : For what ?
fe004 [ s] : If it works .
m e010 [ s] : Uh , uh , uh , I hav en’t t old you what it is yet .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m . Mm m .

m e010 [ s^ df] : This was m y build − up .
m e010 [ s.%−] : An i an idea t hat would be nice i
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ bk|s^ cc] : OK , we ’re crossing our fingers .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : If it worked .
m e003 [ s^ j] : So we ’re building a m ent al space , good .
m e010 [ s^ aa^ j] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ bk^ j] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ aa|s^ rt ] : Right , it was a space builder .
m e010 [ fh|s] : Um , we m ight be able t o handle cont ext in t he sam e
way t hat we handle m ent al spaces
m e010 [ s^ df] : because , uh , you hav e som ewhat t he sam e t hings
going on of , uh , t hings being accessible or not .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ %−−] : And so , i
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e010 [ s] : it c it [ disfm arker] it , uh I t hink if we did it right we m ight
be able t o get at least a lot of t he sam e st ruct ure .
fe004 [ s^ 2|s^ aa] : Use t he sam e [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] Yep .
m e010 [ s] : So t hat pulling som et hing out of a discourse cont ext is I
t hink sim ilar t o ot her kinds of , uh , m ent al space phenom ena .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : I see .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ df] : Uh , I ’ve [ disfm arker] I ’ve [ disfm arker] I ’ve never seen
anybody writ e t hat up
fe004 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ ba^ df] : but m aybe t hey did .
m e010 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m e010 [ s] : That m ay be all ov er t he lit erat ure .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s.%−] : So [ disfm arker] so by default [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s.%−−] : There ’s t hings like t her you know , t here ’s all kinds of
st uff like , um , in [ disfm arker] I t hink I m ent ioned last t im e in Czech if
y ou hav e a [ disfm arker] a verb of saying t hen
m e045 [ s:s] : um , y ou know , you say som et hing like [ disfm arker] or
[ disfm arker] or I was t hinking you can say som et hing like , " oh , I
t hought , uh , you are a republican " or som et hing like t hat .
m e045 [ s:s] : Where as in English you would say , " I t hought you were
" .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e045 [ s] : Um , you know , sort of t he past t ense being copied ont o
t he lower v erb doesn’t happen t here ,
m e045 [ s] : so you have t o say som et hing about , you know , t ense is
det erm ined relat iv e t o current blah − blah − blah .

fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s] : Sam e t hings happens wit h pronouns .
m e045 [ s.%−−] : There ’s languages where , um ,
m e045 [ s.%−−] : if you have a verb of saying t hen ,
m e045 [ %−−] : ehhh ,
m e045 [ %−−] : where [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s] : OK , so a sit uat ion like " Bob said he was going t o t he
m ov ies " , where t hat lower subject is t he sam e as t he person who was
say ing or t hinking , you ’re act ually required t o have " I " t here .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s.%−] : Um , and it ’s sort of in an ext ended funct ion
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : So we would have it be in quot es in English .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m e045 [ s] : But it ’s not perceived as a quot at ive const ruct ion .
m e045 [ s] : I m ean , it ’s been analyzed by t he form alist s as being a
logophoric pronoun ,
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s^ e|qy^ d^ f^ g] : um which m eans a pronoun which refers
back t o t he person who is speaking or t hat sort of t hing , right ?
fe004 [ s^ aa|s^ ba] : Oh , right . Yeah , t hat m akes sense .
m e010 [ b] : OK .
m e045 [ fh] : Um ,
m e045 [ s^ rt :s^ rt ] : but [ disfm arker] uh , t hat happens t o sound like
t he word for " I "
m e045 [ s^ rt ] : but is act ually sem ant ically unrelat ed t o it .
fe004 [ s^ fe] : Oh , no !
m e010 [ s^ ba|%−] : Oh , good , I love t he form ali
m e045 [ fh] : Um ,
fe004 [ qy ^ bh^ rt ] : Really ?
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . [ vocalsound] Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : You ’re kidding .
m e045 [ s] : There ’s a whole book which basically operat es on t his
assum pt ion .
m e045 [ s^ e] : Uh , Mary Dalrym ple ,
m e045 [ s] : uh , t his book , a ninet y − t hree book on , uh on pronoun
st uff .
fe004 [ s^ ar|s^ ba] : No , t hat ’s horrible .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ ba|s^ bk] : That ’s horrible . [ com m ent ] OK .
m e045 [ fh|s] : Well , yeah . And t hen t he sam e t hing for ASL
m e045 [ s] : where , you know , you ’re signing

m e045 [ s] : and som eone says som et hing .
m e045 [ s:s] : And t hen , you know , so " he say " , and t hen you sort of
do a role shift .
m e045 [ s:s] : And t hen you sign " I , t his , t hat , and t he ot her " .
fe004 [ b^ rt ] : Uh − huh .
m e045 [ s:s] : And you know , " I did t his " .
m e045 [ s:s] : That ’s also been analyzed as logophoric and having
not hing t o do wit h " I " .
m e045 [ s] : And t he role shift t hing is com plet ely left out and so on .
m e045 [ fh] : So ,
m e045 [ s] : I m ean , t he point is t hat pronoun references , uh , you
know , sort of t ies in wit h all t his m ent al space st uff and so on , and so
fort h .
fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e045 [ s.%−] : And so , yeah , I m ean [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s|s^ bk] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat d t hat does sound like it ’s
co consist ent wit h what we ’re saying , y eah .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ bk|s^ bu] : OK , so it ’s kind of like t he unspecified m ent al
spaces just are occurring in cont ext .
fe004 [ s] : And t hen when you em bed t hem som et im es you have t o
pop up t o t he h y ou know , depending on t he const ruct ion or t he
what ev er , um , y ou [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker] you ’re scope is
[ disfm arker] m m ight ext end out t o t he [ disfm arker] t he base one .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ cs] : It would be nice t o act ually use t he sam e , um ,
m echanism
fe004 [ s^ df.%−−] : since t here are so m any cases where you act ually
need
fe004 [ s^ e] : it ’ll be one or t he ot her .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : It ’s like , oh , act ually , it ’s t he sam e [ disfm arker] sam e
operat ion .
m e010 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh , OK , so t his [ disfm arker] t his is wort h som e
t hought .
fe004 [ fh] : So .
m e045 [ s|qy^ d^ g] : It ’s like [ disfm arker] it ’s like what ’s happening
[ disfm arker] t hat , y eah , what what ’s happening , uh , t here is t hat
y ou ’re m oving t he base space or som et hing like t hat , right ?
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
m e045 [ s] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s how Fauconnier would t alk

m e010 [ s^ co] : Go ahead .
m n015 [ qy] : i isn’t t hat part easy t hough
m n015 [ s^ df] : because in t erm s of t he s sim spec , it would just m ean

m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ ar] : N no .
fe004 [ b] : Mm m .
m n015 [ %−−] : or [ disfm arker]

m e045 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ ar] : No .
fe004 [ s^ am ] : May be .
fe004 [ fg|s:s] : Yeah , in m odel t heory cuz t he sem ant ics is alway s like "

m e010 [ s^ ar] : No .
fe004 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : you know ?
fe004 [ s:s] : Like " t he speaker say s P and believes not − P " .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e045 [ s^ na] : We have a t heoret ical m odel of sarcasm now .
fe004 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ bk|%−−] : Yeah , right , I m ean .
fe004 [ s^ aa|%−] : Right , right , but ,
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : No , no .
m e010 [ fg|%−−] : Anyway , so [ disfm arker] so , um , I guess
m e010 [ s] : uh , let m e m ake a proposal on how t o proceed on t hat ,
m e010 [ s.%−−] : which is t hat , um ,
m e010 [ s] : it was Keit h ’s , uh , sort of job over t he sum m er t o com e
up wit h t his set of const ruct ions .
m e010 [ fh|s.%−−] : Uh , and m y suggest ion t o Keit h is t hat you , over
t he nex t couple weeks , n
m e045 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ s] : don’t t ry t o do t hem in det ail or form ally
m e010 [ s^ cs] : but just t ry t o describe which ones you t hink we ought
t o hav e .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : Uh , and t hen when Robert get s back we ’ll look at t he set
of t hem .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ cs^ e] : Just [ disfm arker] just sort of , you know , define your
space .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , OK .
m e010 [ fh|s] : And , um , so t h t hese are [ disfm arker] t his is a set of
t hings t hat I t hink we ought t o deal wit h .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : And t hen we ’ll [ disfm arker] we ’ll [ disfm arker] we ’ll go
back ov er it
m e010 [ s] : and w people will [ disfm arker] will give feedback on it .
m e045 [ b] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : And t hen [ disfm arker] t hen we ’ll have a [ disfm arker] at
least init ial spec of [ disfm arker] of what we ’re act ually t rying t o do .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ df] : And t hat ’ll also be useful for anybody who ’s t rying t o
writ e a parser .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e010 [ %−−] : Knowing uh [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ bd^ j] : In case t here ’s any around .
fe004 [ s^ bd^ j] : If we knew any body like t hat .
m e010 [ s^ aa^ j] : Right ,
m e010 [ s^ e.%−−] : " who m ight want "
m e010 [ s] : et cet era .
m e010 [ fh] : So , uh [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ b] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : So a and we get t his [ disfm arker] t his , uh , port als fixed
m e010 [ s] : and t hen we have an idea of t he sort of init ial range .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : And t hen of course Nancy you ’re gonna have t o , uh ,
do y our set of [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bd] : but y ou have t o do t hat anyway .
fe004 [ s^ na|s^ aa] : For t he sam e , y eah , dat a . Yeah , m m − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so we ’re gonna get t he w we ’re basically
dealing wit h t wo dom ains ,
m e010 [ s] : t he t ourist dom ain and t he [ disfm arker] and t he child
language learning .
m e003 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : And we ’ll see what we need for t hose t wo .
m e010 [ s^ cs] : And t hen m y proposal would be t o , um , not t ot ally cut
off m ore general discussion
m e010 [ s] : but t o focus really det ailed work on t he subset of t hings
t hat we ’v e [ disfm arker] we really want t o get done .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : And t hen as a kind of separat e t hread , t hink about t he
m ore general t hings and [ disfm arker] and all t hat .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ df] : Well , I also t hink t he det ailed discussion will hit
[ disfm arker] you know , bring us t o problem s t hat are of a general
nat ure
m e010 [ s^ na] : Uh , wit hout doubt .
m n015 [ s.%−] : and m aybe even [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ df] : But what I want t o do is [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] is
t o [ disfm arker] t o const rain t he t hings t hat we really feel responsible
for .
m n015 [ s^ e] : ev en suggest som e solut ions .
m n015 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m n015 [ b.%] : Mm m .
m e045 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ df:s] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat we say t hese are t he t hings
we ’re really gonna t ry do by t he end of t he sum m er

m e010 [ s] : and ot her t hings we ’ll put on a list of [ disfm arker] of

m e010 [ s^ df] : because you can easily get t o t he point where not hing
get s done
m e010 [ s:qh] : because every t im e y ou st art t o do som et hing you say ,
" oh , y eah , but what about t his case ? "
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ j] : This is [ disfm arker] t his is called being a linguist .
m n015 [ b] : Mm m .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ fh] : And , uh ,
m e045 [ s^ na] : Basically .
fe004 [ s^ na] : Or m e .

fe004 [ s^ bd] : Anyways [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s:s] : There ’s t hat quot e in Jurafsky and Mart in where
[ disfm arker] where it goes [ disfm arker] where som e guy goes , " every

m e010 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Ex act ly .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ bd.%−−] : But anyway .
m e010 [ qy ] : So , is [ disfm arker] is t hat [ disfm arker] does t hat m ake

fe004 [ s^ aa] : Sure , yeah .
m e045 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , yeah , we ’ll st art wit h t hat ,
m e045 [ s] : just figuring out what needs t o be done
m e045 [ s] : t hen act ually t he next st ep is t o st art t rying t o do it .
m e010 [ s^ na] : Ex act ly right .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Got it .
m n015 [ b] : Mm m .

m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , right , right , right .
fe004 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , and [ disfm arker] and t here are cert ainly cases
like t hat .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
fe004 [ s] : Ev en wit h just sem ant ic schem as we have som e exam ples .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe004 [ fh] : So ,
fe004 [ s] : and we ’v e been t alking a lit t le bit about t hat anyway .
m e010 [ fg|s^ cs] : Yeah . So what I would like t o do is separat e t hat
problem out .

fe004 [ s] : Inherit s .
m e010 [ fh] : So um ,
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : m y argum ent is t here ’s not hing you can do wit h t hat t hat
y ou can’t do by just having m ore const ruct ions .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yes .
m e010 [ s^ ba^ bd^ df] : It ’s uglier and it d doesn’t have t he deep
linguist ic insight s and st uff .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right .
m e010 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e045 [ s^ bd] : But what ever .
fe004 [ s^ na] : Uh , t hose are ov er rat ed .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , no , no , no no .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e045 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : No , by all m eans ,
m e045 [ s^ bk] : right . Uh , sure .
m e010 [ s] : And so I [ disfm arker] what I ’d like t o do is [ disfm arker] is in
t he short run focus on get t ing it right .
m e010 [ s:s] : And when we t hink we have it right t hen saying , " aha ! ,
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ qh] : can we m ake it m ore elegant ? "
m e045 [ s^ bk|%−] : Yeah , t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ qh^ e] : Can [ disfm arker] can we , uh [ disfm arker] What are
t he generalizat ions , and st uff ?
m e045 [ s] : Connect t he dot s .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ df] : But rat her t han t ry t o guess a inherit ance st ruct ure
and all t hat sort of st uff before we know what we ’re doing .
m e045 [ b] : Yep .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So I would say in t he short run we ’re not gonna b
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s] : First of all , we ’re not doing t hem yet at all .
m e010 [ s:s^ fe] : And [ disfm arker] and it could be t hat half way
t hrough we say , " aha ! ,
m e010 [ s] : we [ disfm arker] we now see how we want t o clean it up . "
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ fh|s] : Uh , and inherit ance is only one [ disfm arker] I m ean ,
t hat ’s one way t o organize it
m e010 [ s] : but t here are ot hers .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s] : And it m ay or m ay not be t he best way .
m e010 [ s^ fa^ t c] : I ’m sorry ,
m e010 [ s] : y ou had news .
m n015 [ b] : Mm m .

m n015 [ s^ bk|s^ bd] : Oh , just sm all st uff .
m n015 [ fh|s^ ft .%−−] : Um , t hanks t o Eva on our web sit e we can now ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : if you want t o run JavaBay es , uh , you could see
[ disfm arker] get [ disfm arker] download t hese classes .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : And t hen it will enable you [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : she m odified t he GUI so it has now a m a m a but t on m enu
it em for sav ing it int o t he em bedded JavaBayes form at .
fn050 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ b] : Mm m .
m n015 [ s^ ba^ rt ] : So t hat ’s wonderful .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : Great .
m n015 [ s] : And , um and she , a You t est ed it out .
m n015 [ qy ] : Do y ou want t o say som et hing about t hat , t hat it works ,
right ?
fn050 [ s^ rt ] : I was just checking like , when we wanna , um , get t he
post erior probabilit y of , like , variables .
m n015 [ %−] : Wit h t he [ disfm arker]
fn050 [ qy ^ d] : You know how you asked whet her we can , like , just
observe all t he variables like in t he sam e list ?
fn050 [ s] : You can’t .
fn050 [ s^ df] : You have t o m ake separat e queries every t im e .
m n015 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n015 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : OK , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a bit unfort unat e
fn050 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
fn050 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ fh] : but
m n015 [ s.%−] : for t he t im e being it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
fine t o do it [ disfm arker]
fn050 [ s] : You just have t o have a long list of , you know , all t he
v ariables .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
fn050 [ s^ e] : Basically .
m n015 [ fh] : But uh [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bu] : Uh , all t he t hings you want t o query , you just have t o
like ask for separat ely .
fn050 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
m n015 [ s] : Well t hat ’s [ disfm arker] probably m aybe in t he long t erm
t hat ’s good news
m n015 [ s^ df] : because it forces us t o t hink a lit t le bit m ore carefully
how [ disfm arker] how we want t o get an out out put .
m n015 [ s] : Um , but t hat ’s a different discussion for a different t im e .
m n015 [ fh] : And , um ,
m n015 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m n015 [ s] : We ’re really running lat e ,
m n015 [ s] : so I had , uh , an idea yest erday

m n015 [ s^ no] : but , uh , I don’t know whet her we should even st art
discussing .
m e010 [ %−] : W what [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ aa|s^ co] : Yeah , sure , t ell us what it is .
m n015 [ h|s] : Um , t he const rual bit t hat , um , has been point ed t o
but hasn’t been , um , m ade precise by any m eans , um , m ay w m ay
work as follows .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : I t hought t hat we would , uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ df] : t hat t he following t hing would be in incredibly nice
m n015 [ s^ df] : and I have no clue whet her it will work at all or not hing .
m n015 [ s] : So t hat ’s just a t angent , a couple of m ent al disclaim ers
here .
m n015 [ fh|s] : Um , im agine you [ disfm arker] you writ e a Bayes − net ,
m n015 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qw^ br^ d^ m ] : Bayes ?
m n015 [ s^ m ^ na] : Bayes − net ,
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : um , com plet ely from scrat ch every t im e you do const rual .
m n015 [ s] : So y ou have not hing .
m n015 [ s] : Just a whit e piece of paper .
m e010 [ b] : Mm m ,
m e010 [ b] : right .
m n015 [ s] : You consult [ disfm arker] consult your ont ology
m n015 [ s.%−] : which will t ell y ou a bunch of st uff , and part s , and
propert ies , uh − uh − uh
fe004 [ s^ 2] : Grout out t he t hings t hat [ disfm arker] t hat you need .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n015 [ s] : t hen y you ’d sim ply writ e , uh , t hese int o [ disfm arker]
ont o y our [ disfm arker] your whit e piece of paper .
m n015 [ s] : And y ou will get a lot of not es and st uff out of t here .
m n015 [ s^ df] : You won’t get [ disfm arker] you won’t really get any C P
m n015 [ s] : T ’s , t herefore we need everyt hing t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
configures t o what t he sit uat ion is ,
m n015 [ s] : IE , t he cont ext dependent st uff .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : So y ou get what ev er com es from discourse
m n015 [ s] : but also filt ered .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : Uh , so only t he ont ology relevant st uff from t he
discourse
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : plus t he sit uat ion and t he user m odel .
m n015 [ s] : And t hat fills in your CPT ’s wit h which you can t hen query ,
um , t he [ disfm arker] t he net t hat you just wrot e
m n015 [ s:s] : and find out how t hing X is const rued as an ut t erance U .
m n015 [ s] : And t he em bedded JavaBayes works exact ly like t hat ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : t hat once you [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : we have , you know , precise form at in which t o writ e it ,

m n015 [ s] : so we writ e it down .
m n015 [ s] : You query it .
m n015 [ s] : You get t he result ,
m n015 [ s] : and you t hrow it away .
m n015 [ s] : And t he [ disfm arker] t he nice t hing about t his idea is t hat
y ou don’t ever have t o sit down and t hink about it or writ e about it .
m n015 [ s] : You m ay have som e general rules as t o how t hings can be
[ disfm arker] can be const rued as what , so t hat will allow you t o craft
t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he init ial not es .
m n015 [ s] : But it ’s [ disfm arker] in t hat respect it ’s com plet ely
scalable .
m n015 [ s^ df] : Because it doesn’t have any prior , um , configurat ion .
m n015 [ s] : It ’s just you need an ont ology of t he dom ain
m n015 [ s] : and y ou need t he cont ext dependent m odules .
m n015 [ s] : And if t his can be m ade t o work at all , [ vocalsound] t hat ’d
be kind of funky .
m e010 [ fg|s] : Um , it sounds t o m e like y ou want P R
m n015 [ s.%−−] : P R Ms − uh , PRM
m n015 [ s^ df] : I m ean , since you can unfold a PRM int o a
st raight forward Bayes − net [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ df.%−] : Beca − because it [ disfm arker] b because
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ ar|s] : No , no , you can’t .
m e010 [ s] : See t he [ disfm arker] t he crit ical t hing about t he PRM is it
giv es t hese relat ions in general form .
m e010 [ s] : So once you have inst ant iat ed t he PRM wit h t he inst ances
and t her t hen y ou can [ disfm arker] t hen y ou can unfold it .
m n015 [ s^ 2] : Then you can .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m , yeah .
m n015 [ s^ ar|s^ df] : No , I was m using it generic .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : So , uh , probabilist ic , what ever , relat ional m odels .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : What ever you writ e it .
m e010 [ s] : Well , no , but it m at t ers a lot
m n015 [ %−] : In [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ df] : because you [ disfm arker] what you want are t hese
generalized rules
m e010 [ s^ e.%−−] : about t he way t hings relat e ,
m e010 [ s^ e] : t h t hat you t hen inst ant iat e in each case .
m n015 [ s^ 2] : And t hen [ disfm arker] t hen inst ant iat e t hem .
m e010 [ s^ aa|%−] : Yeah , and t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ am ] : That ’s m a m aybe t he [ disfm arker] t he way
[ disfm arker] t he only way it works .
m n015 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e010 [ s^ aa|s^ aap] : Yeah , t hat ’s t he only way it could work .
m e010 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] we have a [ disfm arker] our local expert on P

m e010 [ s] : uh , but m y guess is t hat t hey ’re not current ly good
enough t o do t hat .
m e010 [ s] : But we ’ll [ disfm arker] we ’ll have t o see .
m e010 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ %−−] : But , uh ,
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yes .
m e010 [ s^ ba^ cs] : This is [ disfm arker] t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat would
be a good t hing t o t ry .
m e010 [ s] : It ’s relat ed t o t he Hobbs abduct ion st ory

m n015 [ s^ arp] : Ex cept t here ’s no [ disfm arker] no t heorem prover

fe004 [ s^ 2] : Best explanat ion .
m e010 [ s^ ar|s] : No , t here isn’t a t heorem prover
m e010 [ s] : but t here [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] but t he , um , The

m e010 [ s] : and y ou ’re [ disfm arker] y ou ’re coupling a bunch of t hem

m e010 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ ba] : Tricky .
m e010 [ s^ cs] : But you [ disfm arker] yeah , it ’s a good [ disfm arker] it
’s a [ disfm arker] it ’s a good t hing t o put in your t hesis proposal .
m n015 [ %] : What ’s it ?
m e010 [ qy^ rt ] : So are you gonna writ e som et hing for us before you

m e010 [ s] : We [ disfm arker] obviously we can [ disfm arker] we can do
t his .
m e010 [ qy ] : But t he quest ion is do y ou want t o , for exam ple , send
t he lit t le group , uh , a draft of your t hesis proposal
m e010 [ s^ e] : and get , uh , anot her session on feedback on t hat ?
m e010 [ fh] : Or [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ cs] : We can do it Th − Thursday again .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s^ ba^ na] : Fine wit h m e .

m n015 [ s^ cs] : One or four .
m n015 [ s^ bd] : I don’t care .
m e045 [ s^ na] : To m e t his is equal .
m e045 [ s^ bd] : I don’t care .
m n015 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : If it ’s equal for all ?

fe004 [ s^ ar^ bsc|s^ bd] : no , no , no , uh , I don’t care .
fe004 [ s^ ba] : It ’s fine .
m n015 [ s^ df] : It ’s equal t o all of us ,

m e003 [ s] : The pressure ’s on y ou Nancy .
m n015 [ s] : Liz act ually said she likes four
