m e011 [ s] : OK , we ’re on .
m e011 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : So just m ake sure t hat t h your wireless m ike is on ,
if y ou ’re wearing a wireless .
m e003 [ s] : Check one .
m e003 [ s] : Check one .
m e011 [ s] : And you should be able t o see which one [ disfm arker]
which one you ’re on by , uh , wat ching t he lit t le bars change .
m n015 [ qw] : So , which is m y bar ?
m n015 [ %−−] : Mah !
m n015 [ s] : Num ber one .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e003 [ s] : Sibilance .
m e003 [ s] : Sibilance .
m e011 [ s] : So , act ually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digit s
now , as long as y ou ’ve signed t he consent form , t hat ’s alright .
m e003 [ qy ] : Are we supposed t o read digit s at t he sam e t im e ?
m e011 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e011 [ s^ ar^ r] : No .
m e011 [ s^ e] : Each individually .
m e011 [ s] : We ’re t alking about doing all at t he sam e t im e
m e011 [ s] : but I t hink cognit iv ely t hat would be really difficult .
[ v ocalsound] To t ry t o read t hem while everyone else is .
m e003 [ s^ na] : Ev eryone would need ext rem e focus .
m e011 [ s] : So , when you ’re reading t he digit st rings , t he first t hing
t o do is just say which t ranscript you ’re on .
m e010 [ s^ t 3] : Ot her way .
m e010 [ s] : We m We m ay wind up wit h ver We [ disfm arker] we m ay
need v ersions of all t his garbage .
m n015 [ s^ 2] : For our st uff .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fg|s] : Um . So t he first t hing you ’d wanna do is just say which
t ranscript you ’re on .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ s] : You can see t he t ranscript ?
m e011 [ s] : There ’s t wo large num ber st rings on t he digit s ?
m e011 [ s] : So you would just read t hat one .
m e011 [ s] : And t hen you read each line wit h a sm all pause bet ween
t he lines .
m e011 [ s] : And t he pause is just so t he person t ranscribing it can t ell
where one line ends and t he ot her begins .
m e011 [ s] : And I ’ll give [ disfm arker] I ’ll read t he digit st rings first , so
can see how t hat goes .
m e011 [ fh] : Um .

m e011 [ s] : Again , I ’m not sure how m uch I should t alk about [ pause]
st uff before ev ery one ’s here .
m e010 [ b.%] : Mm m .
m e010 [ s] : Well , we have one m ore com ing .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ qh^ cs] : Well , why don’t I go ahead and read digit st rings
m e011 [ s^ cs^ e] : and t hen we can go on from t here .
m e010 [ z] : OK .
m e010 [ z] : Well , we can st art doing it .
m e011 [ s^ ft ] : Thanks .
m e011 [ s] : So , uh , just also a not e on wearing t he m icrophones .
m e011 [ s] : All of you look like you ’re doing it reasonably correct ly ,
m e011 [ s] : but y ou want it about t wo t hum b widt hs away from your
m out h ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : and t hen , at t he corner .
m e011 [ s^ df] : And t hat ’s so t hat y ou m inim ize breat h sounds ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : so t hat when you ’re breat hing , you don’t breat he int o
t he m ike .
m e011 [ fh] : Um .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Yeah , t hat ’s good .
m e011 [ fh] : And uh [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : So , ev eryone needs t o fill out , only once , t he speaker
form and t he consent form .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : And t he short form [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , you should read t he consent form ,
m e011 [ s] : but uh , t he t hing t o not ice is t hat we will give you an
opport unit y t o edit a all t he t ranscript s .
m e011 [ s] : So , if you say t hings and you don’t want t hem t o be
released t o t he general public , which , t hese will be available at som e
point t o anyone who want s t hem , uh , you ’ll be given an opport unit y
by em ail , uh , t o bleep out any port ions y ou don’t like .
m e011 [ fh] : Um .
m e011 [ s] : On t he speaker form just fill out as m uch of t he inform at ion
as y ou can .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : If you ’re not exact ly sure about t he region ,
m e011 [ s^ bd^ df] : we ’re not exact ly sure eit her .
m e011 [ s] : So , don’t worry t oo m uch about it .
m e011 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] It ’s just self rat ing .
m e011 [ fh] : Um .
m e011 [ s] : And I t hink t hat ’s about it .
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : I m ean , should I [ disfm arker] Do you want m e t o t alk
at all about why we ’re doing t his and what t his project is ?
m e010 [ h|s^ aa] : Um , yeah .
m e011 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e010 [ s^ ar|s] : No . There was [ disfm arker] t here was [ disfm arker]
Let ’s see .

m e003 [ qy ] : Does Nancy know t hat we ’re m eet ing in here ?
m e010 [ %−−] : Oh [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ na] : She got an em ai she was not ified .
m n015 [ s^ na] : I sent an em ail .
m e003 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : Oh yeah , she got an e
m e003 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah .
m e010 [ s] : Whet her she knows [ vocalsound] is anot her quest ion .
m e010 [ fh] : Um .
m e010 [ qy ^ rt ] : So are t he people going t o be ident ified by nam e ?
m e011 [ s] : Well , what we ’re gonna [ disfm arker] we ’ll anonym ize it in
t he t ranscript .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ e] : Um , but not in t he audio .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : So , t hen in t erm s of people worrying about , uh , excising
t hings from t he t ranscript , it ’s unlikely .
m e011 [ s.%−] : So t he
m e010 [ s^ df] : Since it [ disfm arker] it does isn’t at t ribut ed .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see ,
m e010 [ s.%−] : but t he a but t he [ disfm arker] but t he [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa|s:qw] : Right , so if I said , " Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? "
, we ’re not gonna go t hrough and cancel out t he " Jerry " s .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Sure .
m e011 [ s] : Um , so we will go t hrough and , in t he speaker ID t ags
t here ’ll be , y ou know , M − one O seven , M − one O eight .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ fh] : Um , but uh ,
m e011 [ fh] : um , it w uh ,
m e011 [ s^ no] : I don’t know a good way of doing it on t he audio , and
st ill hav e people who are doing discourse research be able t o use t he
dat a .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ df] : No , I [ disfm arker] I wasn’t com plaining ,
m e010 [ s^ df] : I just want ed t o underst and .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : Well , we can m ake up aliases for each of us .
m e011 [ fg|s^ na] : Yeah , I m ean , what ever you wanna do is fine ,
m e010 [ b.%] : Right .
m e012 [ b.%] : OK .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : but we find t hat [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : We want t he m eet ing t o be as nat ural as possible .

m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ df] : So , we ’re t rying t o do real m eet ings .
m e011 [ s] : And so we don’t wanna hav e t o do aliases
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : and we don’t want people t o be edit ing what t hey say .
m n015 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : So I t hink t hat it ’s bet t er just as a pro post − process t o
edit out every t im e you bash Microsoft .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ f] : You know ?
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ fg|qh^ cs^ t c.%−−] : Um , OK . So why don’t you t ell us briefly
m e010 [ s^ t c] : y our [ disfm arker] giv e [ disfm arker] give your e norm al
schpiel .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ %−] : So t h
m e011 [ s] : Um . So t his is [ disfm arker] The project is called Meet ing
Recorder
m e011 [ s] : and t here are lot s of different aspect s of t he project .
m e011 [ s] : Um . So m y part icular int erest is in t he PDA of t he fut ure .
m e011 [ s] : This is a m ock − up of one .
m e011 [ s] : Yes , we do believe t he PDA of t he fut ure will be m ade of
wood .
m e011 [ fh|s] : Um . [ com m ent ] The idea is t hat you ’d be able t o put a
PDA at t he t able at an im prom pt u m eet ing ,
m e011 [ s] : and record it ,
m e011 [ s] : and t hen be able t o do querying and ret rieval lat er on , on
t he m eet ing .
m e011 [ s] : So t hat ’s m y part icular int erest ,
m e011 [ s] : is a port able device t o do m uh , inform at ion ret rieval on
m eet ings .
m e011 [ s] : Ot her people are int erest ed in ot her aspect s of m eet ings .
m e011 [ s] : Um . So t he first st ep on t hat , in any of t hese , is t o
collect som e dat a .
m e011 [ s] : And so what we want ed is a room t hat ’s inst rum ent ed wit h
bot h t he t able t op m icrophones ,
m e011 [ s] : and t hese are very high qualit y pressure zone m ikes ,
m e011 [ s] : as well as t he close t alking m ikes .
m e011 [ s] : What t he close t alk ng t alking m ikes gives us is som e
ground t rut h ,
m e011 [ s] : gives us , um , high qualit y audio ,
m e011 [ s] : um , especially for people who aren’t int erest ed in t he
acoust ic part s of t his corpus .

m e011 [ s] : So , for people who are m ore int erest ed in language , we
didn’t want t o penalize t hem by having only t he far field m ikes available
.
m e011 [ s] : And t hen also , um , it ’s a very , very hard t ask in t erm s of
speech recognit ion .
m e011 [ s] : Um . And so , uh , on t he far field m ikes we can expect very
low recognit ion result s .
m e011 [ s] : So we want ed t he near field m ikes t o at least isolat e t he
difference bet ween t he t wo .
m e011 [ s^ df] : So t hat ’s why we ’re recording in parallel wit h t he close
t alking and t he far field at t he sam e t im e .
m e011 [ s] : And t hen , all t hese channels are recorded sim ult aneously
and fram ed synchronously
m e011 [ s^ df] : so t hat you can also do t hings like , um , beam −
form ing on all t he m icrophones
m e011 [ s] : and do research like t hat .
m e011 [ s] : Our int ent ion is t o release t his dat a t o t he public , um ,
probably t hrough f t hrough a body like t he LDC .
m e011 [ s] : And , uh , just m ake it as a generally available corpus .
m e011 [ fh|s] : Um . [ v ocalsound] There ’s ot her work going on in
m eet ing recording .
m e011 [ s] : So , we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re working wit h SRI ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : wit h UW ,
m e011 [ h|s^ e] : Um . NIST has st art ed an effort which will include video
.
m e011 [ s] : We ’re not including video , obviously .
m e011 [ s] : And uh [ disfm arker] and t hen also , um , a sm all am ount of
assist ance from IBM .
m e011 [ s^ e] : Is also involved .
m e011 [ s] : Um . Oh , and t he digit st rings , t his is just a m ore
const rained t ask .
m e011 [ s] : Um . So because t he general env ironm ent is so
challenging , we decided t o [ disfm arker] t o do at least one set of digit
st rings
m e011 [ s^ e] : t o giv e ourselves som et hing easier .
m e011 [ s] : And it ’s exact ly t he sam e digit st rings as in TI − digit s ,
m e011 [ s] : which is a com m on connect ed digit s corpus .
m e011 [ s] : So we ’ll have som e , um , com parison t o be able t o be
m ade .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ qo^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : Anyt hing else ?
m e010 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ co] : OK , so when t he l last person com es in , just
have t hem wear a wireless .
m e011 [ s] : It should be on already .
m e011 [ fh] : Um .

m e011 [ s] : Eit her one of t hose .
m e011 [ s] : And uh , read t he digit st rings and [ disfm arker] and fill out
t he form s .
m e011 [ s] : So , t he m ost im port ant form is t he consent form ,
m e011 [ s] : so just be s be sure ev ery one signs t hat , if t hey consent .
m n015 [ s] : I ’m sure it ’s pret t y usual for m eet ings t hat people com e
lat e ,
m n015 [ s] : so y ou will have t o leav e what you set .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : And uh , just give m e a call ,
m e011 [ s] : which , m y num ber ’s up t here when your m eet ing is over .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m e011 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] I ’m going t o leave t he m ike here
m e011 [ s] : but it ’s n [ nonvocalsound] Uh , but I ’m not gonna be on
m e011 [ s] : so don’t have t hem use t his one .
m e011 [ s] : It ’ll just be sit t ing here .
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : Input ?
m n015 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : There we go .
m e010 [ s] : By t he way , Adam , we will be using t he , uh , screen as
well .
m n015 [ b] : Yep .
m e010 [ s] : So , you know .
m e010 [ s^ ba^ fe] : Wow !
m e010 [ s^ t ^ t c] : Organizat ion .
m e010 [ s^ bu] : So you guys who got em ail about t his [ pause] oh f uh ,
Friday or som et hing about what we ’re up t o .
m e003 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e012 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n015 [ s^ na] : I got it .
m e003 [ qw^ rt ] : What was t he nat ure of t he em ail ?
m e010 [ s] : Oh , t his was about [ pause] um , inferring int ent ions from
feat ures in cont ex t , and t he words ,
m e010 [ s^ e.%−] : like " s go t o see " , or " visit " , or som e
m n015 [ %−] : Wel − we I [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ qy^ bu^ d] : You didn’t get it ?
m e003 [ s^ nd] : I don’t t hink I did .
m e010 [ s] : I guess t hese g have got bet t er filt ers .
m e010 [ s^ df] : Cuz I sent it t o everybody .
m e010 [ s] : You just blew it off .
m e003 [ b] : Ah .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : It ’s really sim ple t hough .
m n015 [ s] : So t his is t he idea .

m n015 [ fh] : Um .
m n015 [ s] : We could pursue , um , if we t hought it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
wort h it but , uh , I t hink we [ disfm arker] we will agree on t hat , um , t o
com e up wit h a [ disfm arker] wit h a sort of very , very first crude
prot ot y pe ,
m n015 [ s] : and do som e im plem ent at ion work , and do som e
[ disfm arker] som e research , and som e m odeling .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : So t he idea is if you want t o go som ewhere ,
m n015 [ fh] : um , and
m n015 [ s^ co.%−−] : focus on t hat object down [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ t 1] : Oh , I can act ually walk wit h t his .
m n015 [ s^ ba^ t 1] : This is nice .
m n015 [ s^ co] : down here .
m n015 [ s] : That ’s t he Powder − Tower .
m n015 [ s] : Now , um , [ vocalsound] we found in our , uh , dat a and
from ex perim ent s , t hat t here ’s t hree t hings you can do .
m n015 [ fh|s] : Um , you can walk t his way , and com e really , really
close t o it .
m n015 [ s^ e] : And t ouch it .
m n015 [ s] : But y ou cannot ent er or do anyt hing else .
m n015 [ s] : Unless y ou ’re int erest ed in rock clim bing , it won’t do you
no good st anding t here .
m n015 [ s] : It ’s just a dark alley .
m n015 [ s] : But y ou can t ouch it .
m n015 [ s] : If you want t o act ually go up or int o t he t ower , you have t o
go t his way ,
m n015 [ s] : and t hen t hrough som e buildings and up som e st airs and
so fort h .
m n015 [ s] : If you act ually want t o see t he t ower , and t hat ’s what
act ually m ost people want t o do , is just have a good look of it , t ake a
pict ure for t he fam ily , [ com m ent ] you hav e t o go t his way , and go up
here .
m n015 [ s] : And t here you have a vre really view [ disfm arker] It
ex ploded , t he [ disfm arker] during t he Thirt y
m n015 [ s] : y ears − war . Really uh , int erest ing sight .
m e003 [ b] : Mm m .
m n015 [ fh|s^ rt ] : And um , t hese uh [ disfm arker] t hese lines are , um ,
pat hs ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : or so That ’s ab er , i
m n015 [ s] : t he st reet net work of our geographic inform at ion syst em .
m n015 [ s] : And y ou can t ell t hat we deliberat ely cut out t his part .
m n015 [ s^ df] : Because ot herwise we couldn’t get our GIS syst em t o
t ake [ disfm arker] t o lead people t his way .
m n015 [ s] : It would always use t he closest point t o t he object ,
m n015 [ s] : and t hen t he t ourist s would be faced , you know , in front
of a wall ,

m n015 [ s] : but it would do t hem absolut ely no good .
m n015 [ s] : So , [ vocalsound] what we found int erest ing is , first of all ,
int ent ions differ .
m n015 [ s] : May be you want t o ent er a building .
m n015 [ s] : May be y ou want t o see it ,
m n015 [ s] : t ake a pict ure of it .
m n015 [ s] : Or m ay be you act ually want t o com e as close as possible
t o t he building .
m n015 [ s] : For what ever reason t hat m ay be .
m e003 [ qw] : What ’s it [ disfm arker] what ’s it m ade out of ?
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : Um , r red lim est one .
m e003 [ s] : So m aybe you would wanna t ouch it .
m n015 [ s^ aa|s^ m ^ na] : Yeah , m aybe you would want t o t ouch it .
m n015 [ fh] : Um .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : Okay , I [ disfm arker] This , um [ disfm arker] These
int ent ions , we [ disfm arker] w w we could , if we want t o , call it t he
[ disfm arker] t he Vist a m ode ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : where we just want t o [ disfm arker] eh [ disfm arker] s
get t he overv iew or look at it ,
m n015 [ s] : t he Ent er m ode ,
m n015 [ s] : and t he , well , Tango m ode .
m n015 [ s] : I always com e up wit h [ disfm arker] wit h silly nam es .
m n015 [ s] : So t his " Tango " m eans , lit erally t ranslat ed , " t o t ouch " .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : So [ disfm arker] But som et im es t he [ disfm arker] t he
Tango m ode is really relevant in t he [ disfm arker] in t he sense t hat , um
, if y ou want t o , uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s.%−−] : If you don’t have t he int ent ion of ent ering your building
, but y ou know t hat som et hing is really close t o it , and you just want
t o approach it , or get t o t hat building .
m n015 [ s] : Consider , for exam ple , t he Post Office in Chicago , a
building so large t hat it has it s own zip code .
m n015 [ s] : So t he ent rance could be m iles away from t he closest
point .
m n015 [ s] : So som et im es it m m m m akes sense m ay be t o d t o
dist inguish t here .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : So , um , I ’ve looked , uh , t hrough t went y som e
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ bd^ df] : Uh , I didn’t look t hrough all t he dat a .
m n015 [ s] : um , and t here [ disfm arker] t here ’s uh , a lot m ore
different way s in people [ disfm arker] uh , t he ways people phrase how
t o g get [ disfm arker] if t hey want t o get t o a cert ain place .
m n015 [ s] : And som et im es here it ’s b it ’s a lit t le bit m ore obvious
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ fh|s] : Um . [ vocalsound] Maybe I should go back a couple of
st eps
m n015 [ s.%−] : and go t hrough t he [ disfm arker]

m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ co] : No , OK com e in , sit down .
m e010 [ s^ co] : If y ou grab yourself a m icrophone .
m n015 [ s] : You need t o sign som e st uff and read som e digit s .
m e010 [ s] : Well , you can sign aft erwards .
m n015 [ s] : O or lat er .
m e003 [ s] : You hav e t o al also have t o read som e digit s .
m e010 [ s] : Aft erwards .
fe004 [ s^ bk|s] : OK . [ com m ent ] OK . Aft erwards is fine .
m n015 [ s] : They are uncom fort able .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

fe004 [ s^ ft ] : Thank you .
m n015 [ fg|s^ t ^ t c] : OK , but t hat was our idea .
m e010 [ s] : And it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it it also
has t o be swit ched on , Nance .
m n015 [ %−] : Is [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : No , t hat one ’s already on , I t hought he said .
m n015 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : It ’s on ?
m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : OK , good .
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ bk|s^ na] : OK . It ’s on .
m n015 [ fg|s] : OK . That was t he idea .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : Um , people , when t hey w when t hey want t o go t o a
building , som et im es t hey just want t o look at it .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : Som et im es t hey want t o ent er it .
m n015 [ s] : And som et im es t hey want t o get really close t o it .
m n015 [ s] : That ’s som et hing we found .
m n015 [ s] : It ’s just a t ruism .
m n015 [ s] : And t he places where you will lead t hem for t hese
int ent ions are som et im es ex in incredibly different .
m n015 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I gave an exam ple where t he point where you
end up if you want t o look at it is com plet ely different from where
[ disfm arker] if y ou want t o ent er it .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : So , t his is sort of how people m ay , uh [ disfm arker]
m ay phrase t hose request s t o a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a m ock −
up sy st em at least t hat ’s t he way t hey did it .
m n015 [ s:qw] : And we get t ons of [ disfm arker] of t hese " how do I get
t o " , " I want t o go t o " ,
m n015 [ s:s] : but also , " give m e direct ions t o " , and " I would like t o
see " .
m n015 [ fh|s.%−−] : And um , what we can sort of do , if we look closer a
closer at t he [ disfm arker] t he dat a [ disfm arker]

m n015 [ s] : That was t he wrong one .
m n015 [ s] : um , we can look at som e fact ors t hat m ay m ake a
difference .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : First of all ,
m n015 [ s^ ba] : v ery im port ant ,
m n015 [ s] : and um , t hat [ disfm arker] I ’ve com plet ely forgot t hat
when we t alked .
m n015 [ s:qw] : This is of course a crucial fact or , " what t ype of object
is it ? "
m n015 [ s] : So , som e buildings you just don’t want t o t ake pict ures of
.
m n015 [ s^ e] : Or very rarely .
m n015 [ s] : But you usually want t o ent er t hem .
m n015 [ s] : Som e object s are m ore pict uresque ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : and you [ disfm arker] m ore f m ore highly phot ographed .
m n015 [ s] : Then of course t he [ disfm arker] t he act ual phrases m ay
giv e us som e idea of what t he person want s .
m n015 [ fh|s] : Um . Som et im es I found in t he [ disfm arker] Uh , looking
at t he dat a , in a superficial way , I found som e s sort of m odifiers t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat m m ay also giv e us a hint ,
m n015 [ fh|s:s] : um , " I ’m t ry ing t o get t o "
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Nuh ?
m n015 [ s:s] : " I need t o get t o " .
m n015 [ s] : Sort of hint s t o t he fact t hat you ’re not really sight seeing
and [ disfm arker] and just f t here for pleasure and so fort h and so on .
m n015 [ s] : And t his leads us st raight t o t he cont ext which also should
be considered .
m n015 [ s] : That what ever it is you ’re doing at t he m om ent m ay also
int er influence t he int erpret at ion of [ disfm arker] of a phrase .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : So , t his is , uh , really
m n015 [ fh] : uh , uh , uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : My suggest ion is really sim ple .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : We st art wit h , um [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : Now , Let m e , uh , say one m ore t hing .
m n015 [ s] : What we do know , is t hat t he parser we use in t he
Sm art Kom sy st em will never different iat e bet ween any of t hese .
m n015 [ s] : So , basically all of t hese t hings will result in t he sam e XML
M − t hree − L st ruct ure .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : Sort of act ion " go " ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : and t hen an object .
fe004 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Yeah ?
m n015 [ s^ e] : and a source .
m n015 [ s] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s way t oo crude t o
d capt ure t hose differences in int ent ions .
m n015 [ s^ rt :s^ fe] : So , I t hought , " Mm m !

m n015 [ s] : May be for a deep underst anding t ask , t hat ’s a nice sort
of playground or first lit t le t hing . "
m n015 [ s.%−−] : Where we can st art it and n sort of look [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : " OK , we need , we gonna get t hose M − t hree − L
st ruct ures .
m n015 [ s] : The crude , undifferent iat ed parse .
m n015 [ s^ e] : Int erpret ed input .
m n015 [ s] : We m ay need addit ional part of speech , or m aybe just
som e inform at ion on t he verb , and m odifiers , auxiliaries .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : We ’ll see .
m n015 [ s^ cc^ rt ] : And I will t ry t o [ disfm arker] t o sort of com e up wit h
a list of fact ors t hat we need t o get out of t here ,
m n015 [ s] : and m ay be we want t o get a g swit ch for t he cont ext .
m n015 [ s] : So t his is not som et hing which we can act ually m onit or ,
[ v ocalsound] now ,
m n015 [ s] : but just is som et hing we can set .
m n015 [ s] : And t hen you can all im agine sort of a [ disfm arker] a
const rained sat isfact ion program , depending on [ disfm arker] on what
, um , com es out .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : We want t o have an [ disfm arker] a st ruct ure result ing
m n015 [ s] : if we feed it t hrough a belief − net or [ disfm arker] or
som et hing along t hose lines . We ’d get an inferred int ent ion , we
[ disfm arker] we produce a st ruct ure t hat different iat es bet ween t he
Vist a , t he Ent er , and t he , um , Tango m ode .
m n015 [ s] : Which I t hink we m aybe want t o ignore .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : But . That ’s m y idea .
m n015 [ s] : It ’s up for discussion .
m n015 [ s] : We can change all of it ,
m n015 [ s] : any bit of it .
m n015 [ s] : Throw it all away .
m e012 [ s] : Now @ @ t his em ail t hat y ou sent , act ually .
m e010 [ qw^ br] : What ?
m e012 [ s] : Now I rem em ber t he em ail .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e003 [ b] : Huh .
m e003 [ s] : St ill , I have no recollect ion what soever of t he em ail .
m e003 [ s] : I ’ll have t o go back and check .
m e010 [ s^ ba^ bd] : Not im port ant .
m e010 [ s] : So , what is im port ant is t hat we underst and what t he
proposed t ask is .
m e010 [ s] : And , t he [ disfm arker] t he i uh , Robert and I t alked about
t his som e on Friday .
m e010 [ fh|s] : And we t hink it ’s well − form ed .
m e010 [ s] : So we t hink it ’s a well − form ed , uh , st art er t ask for t his ,
uh , deeper underst anding in t he t ourist dom ain .

m e012 [ qw] : So , where exact ly is t he , uh , deeper underst anding
being done ?
m e012 [ qy ] : Like I m ean , s is it before t he Bayes − net ?
m e012 [ qy .%−−] : Is it , uh [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : Well , it ’s t he [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s always all
of it .
m e010 [ s] : So , in general it ’s alway s going t o be , t he answer is ,
ev ery where .
m e010 [ s] : Uh , so t he not ion is t hat , uh , t his isn’t real deep .
m e010 [ s] : But it ’s deep enough t hat y ou can dist inguish bet ween
t hese t h t hree quit e different kinds of , uh , going t o see som e t ourist
t hing .
m e010 [ s] : And , so t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he quot e " deep " t hat
we ’re t ry ing t o get at .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : And , Robert ’s point is t hat t he current front − end
doesn’t give you any way t o [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : Not only doesn’t it do it , but it also doesn’t give you
enough inform at ion t o do it .
m e010 [ s] : It isn’t like , if you just t ook what t he front − end gives you ,
and used som e clever inference algorit hm on it , you would be able t o
figure out which of t hese is going on .
m e010 [ fh] : So , uh ,
m e010 [ s] : and t his is [ disfm arker] Bu − I in general it ’s gonna be t rue
of any kind of deep underst anding ,
m e010 [ s] : t here ’s gonna be cont ext ual t hings ,
m e010 [ s] : t here ’re gonna be linguist ic t hings ,
m e010 [ s] : t here ’re gonna be discourse t hings ,
m e010 [ s] : and t hey got t a be com bined .
m e010 [ s] : And , m y idea on how t o com bine t hem is wit h a belief − net
,
m e010 [ s^ bd^ df] : alt hough it m ay t urn out t hat t som e t ot ally
different t hing is gonna work bet t er .
m e010 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um , t he idea would be t hat [ vocalsound] you , uh ,
t ake your [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : You ’re edit ing your slide ?
m n015 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah . As i a sort of , as I get ideas ,
m n015 [ %−−] : uh w uh .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n015 [ s^ df] : So , discourse [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker]
I t hought about t hat .
m n015 [ s] : Of course t hat needs t o sort of go in t here .
m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ fa] : Oh . I ’m sorry .
m e010 [ fg|s] : OK . So . This is m inut es [ disfm arker] t aking m inut es as
we go ,
m e010 [ s^ e] : in his [ disfm arker] in his own way .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yep .

m e010 [ s.%−−] : Um , but t he p t he [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ fg|s] : Anyway . So t he t hing is , [ vocalsound] i uh , d naively
speaking , y ou ’ve [ disfm arker] you ’ve got a [ disfm arker] for t his lit t le
t ask , a belief − net ,
m e010 [ s] : which is going t o hav e as out put , t he condit ional pr
probabilit y of one of t hree t hings ,
m e010 [ s:s] : t hat t he person want s t o [ disfm arker] uh , t o View it , t o
Ent er it , or t o Tango wit h it .
m e010 [ fh] : Um .
m e010 [ s] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he out put of t he
belief − net is pret t y well form ed .
m e010 [ s] : And , t hen t he input s are going t o be t hese kinds of t hings
.
m e010 [ s.%−−] : And , t hen t he quest ion is [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : t here are t wo quest ions [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ qh] : is , uh , one , where do you get t his i [ com m ent ]
inform at ion from ,
m e010 [ qh] : and t wo , what ’s t he st ruct ure of t he belief − net ?
m e010 [ qh^ e] : So what are t he condit ional probabilit ies of t his , t hat ,
and t he ot her , giv en t hese t hings ?
m e010 [ s] : And you probably need int erm ediat e nodes .
m e010 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] we don’t know what t hey are yet .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So it m ay well be t hat , uh , for exam ple , t hat , uh ,
knowing whet her [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : Oh , anot her t hing y ou want is som e inform at ion abou I
t hink , about t he t im e of day .
m e010 [ s] : Now , t hey m ay wanna call t hat part of cont ex t .
m e010 [ s] : But t he t im e of day m at t ers a lot .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s.%−] : And , if t hings are obviously closed , t hen , you
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ 2] : People won’t want t o ent er it .
m e010 [ s^ m ^ na] : Pe − people don’t wanna ent er t hem .
m e010 [ s] : And , if it ’s not obvious , you m ay want t o act ually uh ,
point out t o people t hat it ’s closed [ disfm arker] you know , what t hey
’re g going t o is closed and t hey don’t have t he opt ion of ent ering it .
m n015 [ %−−] : s b
m e010 [ s] : So anot her t hing t hat can com e up , and will com e up as
soon as you get serious about t his is , t hat anot her opt ion of course is
t o hav e a [ disfm arker] m ore of a dialogue .
m e010 [ s] : So if som eone say s som et hing you could ask t hem .
m e003 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] Now , one t hing you could do is always
ask t hem ,
m e010 [ s^ bd^ df] : but t hat ’s boring .

m e010 [ s] : And it also w it also be a pain for t he person using it .
m e010 [ s] : So one t hing you could do is build a lit t le syst em t hat , said
, " whenever you got a quest ion like t hat I ’ve got one of t hree answers
.
m e010 [ s] : Ask t hem which one y ou want . "
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : But t hat ’s , um , not what we ’re gonna do .
m n015 [ s] : But m ay be t hat ’s a false st at e of t he syst em , t hat it ’s t oo
close t o call .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Oh yeah .
m e010 [ s] : You want t he [ disfm arker] y ou want t he abilit y t o a You
want t he abilit y t o ask ,
m e010 [ s] : but what you don’t wanna do is onl build a syst em t hat
always asks every t im e ,
m e010 [ s.%−−] : and i
m e010 [ s^ df] : That ’s not get t ing at t he scient ific problem ,
m e010 [ s.%−−] : and it ’s [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : In general you ’re [ disfm arker] you know , it ’s gonna be
m uch m ore com plex t han t hat .
m e010 [ s] : a This is purposely a really sim ple case .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ fh] : So , uh [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ t c] : I have one m ore point t o [ disfm arker] t o Bhaskara ’s
quest ion .
m n015 [ s] : Um , I t hink also t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he deep
underst anding part of it is [ disfm arker] is going t o be in t here t o t he
ex t ent t hat we um , want it in t erm s of our m odeling .
m n015 [ s] : We can st art , you know , basic from hum an beings ,
m n015 [ s] : m odel t hat ,
m n015 [ s] : it s m ot ions ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : going , walking , seeing ,
m n015 [ s] : we can m em m odel all of t hat
m n015 [ s] : and t hen com pose what ever inferences o we m ake out of
t hese really concept ual prim it ives .
m n015 [ s] : That will be ext rem ely deep in t he [ disfm arker] in
[ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in m y underst anding .
m e010 [ fg|qh] : Yeah . S so [ disfm arker] so t he way t hat m ight com e
up , if y ou wanna [ disfm arker] Suppose you want ed t o do t hat , you
m ight say , " Um , as an int erm ediat e st ep in your belief − net , is t here
a Source − Pat h − Goal schem a involved ? "
m e010 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m e010 [ qh] : And if so , uh , is t here a focus on t he goal ?
m e010 [ qh] : Or is t here a focus on t he pat h ?
m e010 [ s] : or som et hing .

m e010 [ s.%−−] : And t hat could be , uh , one of t he condit iona
m e010 [ s] : y ou know , t h t he [ disfm arker] In som e piece of t he belief −
net , t hat could be t he [ disfm arker] t he appropriat e t hing t o ent er .
m e012 [ qw] : So , where would we ex t ract t hat inform at ion from ?
m e012 [ s^ bu^ e^ rt ] : From t he M − t hree − L ?
m e010 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e010 [ s^ ar^ r|s^ df.%−−] : No . See , t he M − t hree − L is not gonna give
th
m e010 [ s] : What he was saying is , t he M − t hree − L does not have any
of t hat .
m e010 [ s:s] : All it has is som e really crude st uff saying , " A person
want s t o go t o a place . "
m e012 [ b] : Right .
m e003 [ s^ bu] : The M − t hree − L is t he old Sm art Kom out put ?
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : M − t hree well , M − t hree − L it self refers t o Mult im edia Mark
− up Language .
m e003 [ s] : It ’s just a language .
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Right , yeah .
m e010 [ s.%−] : So we have t h w we we we have t o have a bet t er w way
of referring t o [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : The parser out put ?
m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : " Analy zed speech " I t hink it ’s what t hey call it ,
m e010 [ %−] : The [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ am ] : Well , OK .
m n015 [ %−] : really , oder [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : o t h No , act ually , int ent ion lat t ices is what we ’re gonna

m e010 [ s] : Is − i but t hey c t hey call it int ent ion lat t ice ,

m n015 [ s] : In − in a int ent ion lat t ice k Hypot hesis .
m e010 [ fg] : Any way .
m n015 [ s] : They call it int ent ion hypot heses .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : So , t h t hey ’re gonna giv e us som e cr uh [ disfm arker] or
[ disfm arker] We can assum e t hat y you get t his crude inform at ion .
m e010 [ s^ e] : About int ent ion ,
m e010 [ s] : and t hat ’s all t hey ’re going t o provide .
m e010 [ s] : And t hey don’t give y ou t he kind of object ,
m e010 [ s] : t hey don’t give you any discourse hist ory ,
m e010 [ s] : if y ou want t o keep t hat you have t o keep it som ewhere

m n015 [ s] : Well , t hey keep it .
m n015 [ s^ e] : We have t o request it .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Nuh ?
m n015 [ s] : But it ’s not in t here .
m e010 [ s] : Well , t hey [ disfm arker] t hey kee t hey keep it by t heir light s
.
m e010 [ s] : It m ay [ disfm arker] it m ay or m ay not be what [ disfm arker]
what we want .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ %−] : Yeah , or i
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e003 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So , if som eone says , " I wanna t ouch t he side
of t he Powder − Tower " , t hat would [ disfm arker] basically , we need t o
pop up Tango m ode and t he [ disfm arker] and t he direct ions ?
m e010 [ s^ na|s^ aa] : If i if [ disfm arker] Yeah , if it got as sim ple as t hat
, yeah .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ df] : But it wouldn’t .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : But t hat doesn’t necessarily [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : But we ’d hav e t o infer a Source − Pat h −

m n015 [ fh] : Um ,
m n015 [ s^ df] : because um , som et im es people just say t hings
[ disfm arker]

m n015 [ s:qw] : That ’s what t hey say , is , " Where is it ? " .
m n015 [ s:qw] : Where is t hat dam n t hing ?
m e003 [ s.%−−] : And t he parser would out put [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : Well , t hat ’s a [ disfm arker] a quest ion m ark .
m n015 [ %−−] : sh
m n015 [ s.%−−] : A lot of parsers , um ,
m n015 [ %−−] : just , uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : That ’s way beyond t heir scope , is [ disfm arker] of

m n015 [ s^ f] : You know ?

m n015 [ s] : st ill out com e w t he out com e will be som e form of st ruct ure

m n015 [ s^ f^ rt ] : you know ?
m n015 [ s] : som ebody else has t o do t hat job lat er .
m e003 [ s] : I ’m just t rying t o figure out what t he Sm art Kom syst em

m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s^ e] : depending on t hese t hings .
m n015 [ s] : Um , it will probably t ell you how far away it is ,
m n015 [ s] : at least t hat ’s [ disfm arker] That ’s even what Deep Map
does .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : It t ells you how far away it is ,

fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Exact ly .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s^ df^ e] : Y y eh [ disfm arker] you won’t t ell t hem how t o get

fe004 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n015 [ s] : But if it ’s t he post office , you will t ell t hem how t o get

fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n015 [ s] : So t h They have done som e int erest ing experim ent s on
t hat in Ham burg as well .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ fh] : So .
m e010 [ fg] : But [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : i Go [ disfm arker] go back t o t he [ disfm arker] t he uh ,
th
m e010 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , t hat slide .
m n015 [ fg|s] : So I w t his is [ disfm arker] " ont o " is [ disfm arker] is
knowledge about buildings ,
m n015 [ s] : t heir opening t im es ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : and t hen t coupled wit h t im e of day , um , t his should
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ f] : You know .
fe004 [ s^ bu] : So t hat cont ext was like , um , t heir presum ed purpose

fe004 [ s] : i like business or t ravel ,
fe004 [ s^ e] : as well as t he ut t erance cont ext , like , " I ’m now

m n015 [ s] : Hist ory .
m n015 [ s^ e] : Discourse hist ory .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ bd] : What ever .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ cs] : So we can work out t erm inology lat er .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m e010 [ s] : So , t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re quit e dist inct .
m e010 [ s^ df] : I m ean , you need t hem bot h ,
m e010 [ s] : but t hey ’re quit e dist inct .
m e010 [ s] : And , so what we were t alking about doing , a a as a first
shot , is not doing any of t he linguist ics .
m e010 [ s] : Except t o find out what seem s t o be [ pause] useful .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So , t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he reason t he
belief − net is in blue , is t he not ion would be [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bd^ df] : Uh , t his m ay be a bad dis bad idea ,

m e010 [ s^ rt ] : but t he idea is t o t ake as a first goal , see if we could
act ually build a belief − net t hat would m ake t his t hree way dist inct ion
uh , in a plausible way ,
m e010 [ s.%−−] : giv en
m e010 [ s] : t hese [ disfm arker] We have all t hese t ranscript s
m e010 [ s] : and we ’re able t o , by hand , ext ract t he feat ures t o put in
t he belief − net .
m e010 [ s:s^ bk] : Saying , " Aha !
m e010 [ s^ e:s] : here ’re t he t hings which , if you get t hem out of
[ disfm arker] out of t he language and discourse , and put t hem int o
t he belief − net , it would t ell you which of t hese t hree uh , int ent ions is
m ost likely . "
m e010 [ s] : And if [ disfm arker] t o act ually do t hat , build it , um
[ disfm arker] you know , run it [ disfm arker] y y run it on t he dat a where
y ou hand − t ranscribe t he param et ers .
m e010 [ s] : And see how t hat goes .
m e010 [ s] : If t hat goes well , t hen we can st art worry ing about how we
would ex t ract t hem .
m e010 [ qh] : So [ disfm arker] where would you get t his inform at ion ?
m e010 [ s] : And , ex pand it t o [ disfm arker] t o ot her t hings like t his .
m e010 [ s] : But if we can’t do t hat , t hen we ’re in t rouble .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : I m ean t h t h i i if you can’t do t his t ask ,
m e010 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ 2^ cs] : We need a different , uh , engine .
m e010 [ s^ aa|s] : Uh , uh , yeah , or som et hing .
m n015 [ s^ bsc] : Machine , I m ean .
m e010 [ s] : Well it [ disfm arker] i I if it [ disfm arker] if it ’s t he belief −

m e010 [ s] : but I don’t t hink t hat ’s gonna be t he case .
m e010 [ s] : I t hink t hat , uh , if we can get t he inform at ion , a belief −
net is a perfect ly good way of doing t he inferent ial com binat ion of it .
m e010 [ qh] : The real issue is , do what are t he fact ors involved in
det erm ining t his ?
m e010 [ s^ no^ rt ] : And I don’t know .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ s.%−] : But , only w
m e010 [ s^ co] : Hold on a s Hold on a second .
m n015 [ %−] : Muh .
m e010 [ s] : So , I know .
m e010 [ qy ^ rt ] : Uh , uh , is it clear what ’s going on here ?
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
fe004 [ s^ df] : Um , I m issed t he beginning ,
fe004 [ fh] : but , um
fe004 [ s.%−−] : I guess [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qy ^ rt ] : could you back t o t he slide ,
fe004 [ s^ e^ rt ] : t he previous one ?

fe004 [ qy ^ bu.%−−] : So , is it t hat it ’s , um [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : These are all fact ors t hat uh , a These are t he

fe004 [ qrr] : or t hat we want t o [ vocalsound] t ake int o account ?
fe004 [ s.%−] : You were saying n
m e010 [ s] : Take t hem int o account .
fe004 [ s] : Take t he [ disfm arker] t he linguist ic fact ors t oo .
m e010 [ s.%−] : But [ disfm arker] but y ou don’t worry about [ disfm arker]
h
fe004 [ s^ bk|s^ 2] : Oh , how t o ex t ract t hese feat ures .
m e010 [ s^ m ^ na] : how t o ext ract t hem .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : So , f let ’s find out which ones we need first ,
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Got it .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ bu] : And [ disfm arker] and it ’s clear from t he dat a , um , like
, sort a t he correct answer in each case .
m e010 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ ar] : No .
fe004 [ %−] : But l
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ ar] : No .
fe004 [ s.%−] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he t hing I ’m curious ab
m n015 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ cs] : Let ’s go back t o t h Let ’s go back t o t he [ disfm arker]
t he [ disfm arker] t he slide of dat a .
fe004 [ qy .%−−] : Like do we know from t he dat a wh which [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ %−] : Um [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ nd] : Not from t hat dat a .
m n015 [ s] : But , um , since we are designing a [ disfm arker] a
[ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] an , com pared t o t his , even bigger dat a
collect ion effort , [ com m ent ] um , we will definit ely t ake care t o put it in
t here ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : in som e shape , way , form over t he ot her ,
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : t o see whet her we can , t hen , get sort of em pirically
v alidat ed dat a .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : Um , from t his , we can som et im es , you know
[ disfm arker]

m n015 [ qh^ df] : an and t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] but t hat
[ disfm arker] isn’t t hat what we need for a belief − net anyhow ?
m n015 [ s.%−−] : is sort of [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : s som et im es when people want t o just see it , t hey
phrase it m ore like t his ?
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : But it doesn’t exclude any body from phrasing it t ot ally
different ly , ev en if t hey st ill [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : you know ?
m n015 [ s] : But t hen ot her fact ors m ay com e int o play t hat change t he
out com e of t heir belief − net .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : So , um , t his is ex act ly what [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ df] : Because y you can never be sure .
m n015 [ s:s] : And I ’m sure even i t he m ost , sort of , deliberat e dat a
collect ion experim ent will never giv e you dat a t hat say , " Well , if it ’s
phrased like t hat , t he int ent ion is t his . "
fe004 [ b] : Sure .
m n015 [ s.%−] : You know , because t hen , uh , you [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : u u I m ean , t he only way you could get t hat is if you were t o
giv e t h t he x subject s a t ask .
fe004 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
fe004 [ s.%−] : Where you have [ disfm arker] where your , uh , current

m n015 [ %−] : We
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah !
fe004 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n015 [ s] : That ’s what we ’re doing .
fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So t hat ’s what you want ?
m n015 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but we will st ill get t he phrasing all over
t he place .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s] : So y ou will know .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s.%−] : I ’m sure t hat , you know [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] No , t hat ’s fine .
fe004 [ s] : I guess , it ’s just knowing t he int ent ion from t he
ex perim ent al subject .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ 2|s^ aa] : From t hat t ask , y eah .
m e010 [ fg|s] : So , uh , I t hink you all know t his , but we are going t o
act ually use t his lit t le room

fe004 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e010 [ s] : and st art recording subject s probably wit hin a m ont h or
som et hing .
m e010 [ s] : So , t his is not any [ disfm arker] lo any of you guys ’ worry ,
m e010 [ s] : ex cept t hat we m ay want t o push t hat effort t o get
inform at ion we need .
m e010 [ s] : So our job [ vocalsound] is t o figure out how t o solv e t hese
problem s .
m e010 [ s] : If it t urns out t hat we need dat a of a cert ain sort , t hen
t he sort of dat a collect ion branch can be , uh , asked t o do t hat .
m e010 [ s] : And one of t he reasons why we ’re recording t he m eet ing
for t hese guy s is cuz we want t heir help when we d we st art doing uh ,
recording of subject s .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : So , yeah [ disfm arker] y y ou ’re absolut ely right ,
t hough .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : No , you [ disfm arker] you will not have ,
m e010 [ s] : and t here it is ,
m e010 [ fh] : and , uh [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : But you know , y y
m e010 [ fh] : t he , um [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−−] : And I t hink t he ot her concern t hat has com e up before ,
t oo , is if it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ no] : I don’t know if t his was collect ed [ disfm arker] what
sit uat ion t his dat a was collect ed in .
fe004 [ qy ^ rt ] : Was it [ disfm arker] is it t he one t hat you showed in your
t alk ?
fe004 [ s.%−] : Like people [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ ar] : No , no .
fe004 [ %−−] : But
m n015 [ s^ ar^ r] : No .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So was t his , like , som eone act ually m obile , like
[ disfm arker] s using a device ?
m n015 [ h] : Uh ,
m n015 [ s^ ar|%−−] : N no , no not [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ aap] : i it was m obile
m n015 [ s] : but not [ disfm arker] not wit h a w a real wizard syst em .
m n015 [ s] : So t here were never answers .
fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK . OK .
fe004 [ qy .%−−] : But , is it [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ no] : I guess I don’t know [ disfm arker] The sit uat ion of
[ disfm arker] of collect ing t h t he dat a
fe004 [ s^ e] : of , like [ disfm arker] Here you could im agine t hem being
[ disfm arker] walking around t he cit y . as like one sit uat ion .

fe004 [ s] : And t hen you have all sort s of ot her c sit uat ional cont ext
fact ors t hat would influence w how t o int erpret , like you said , t he
scope and t hings like t hat .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : If t hey ’re doing it in a [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : you know , " I ’m sit t ing here wit h a m ap and asking
quest ions " ,
fe004 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I would im agine t hat t he dat a would be really
different .
fe004 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um , so it ’s just [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ df] : But [ disfm arker] It was never t h t h t he goal of t hat dat a
collect ion t o [ disfm arker] t o serve for sat for such a purpose .
m n015 [ s] : So t hat ’s why for exam ple t he t asks were not
different iat ed by int ent ionalit y ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : t here was n t here was no label ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s^ e] : you know , int ent ion A , int ent ion B , int ent ion C .
m n015 [ s^ e] : Or t ask A , B , C .
m n015 [ fh] : Um
m n015 [ s] : I ’m sure we can produce som e if we need it ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : um , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat will help us along t hose lines .
m n015 [ s] : But , you know , you got t a leave som et hing for ot her
people t o m odel .
m n015 [ s] : So , t o [ disfm arker] Finding out what , you know ,
sit uat ional con what t he cont ex t ual fact ors of t he sit uat ion really are ,
y ou know is an int erest ing s int erest ing t hing .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : u u Sort of I ’m , at t he m om ent , curious and I ’m
[ disfm arker] I ’m [ disfm arker] s w want t o approach it from t he end
where we can s sort of st art wit h t his t oy syst em t hat we can play
around wit h ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : so t hat we get a clearer not ion of what input we need for
t hat ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : what suffices and what doesn’t .
m n015 [ s] : And t hen we can st art worrying about where t o get t his
input ,
m n015 [ qh] : what [ disfm arker] what do we need , you know
[ disfm arker]

m n015 [ s^ rt ] : Ult im at ely once we are all expert s in changing t hat
parser , for exam ple , m aybe , t here ’s just a couple t hree t hings we
need t o do
m n015 [ s] : and t hen we get m ore what ev er , part of speech and m ore
const ruct ion − t ype − like st uff out of it .
fe004 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ s] : It ’s a m pragm at ic approach , uh , at t he m om ent .
m e003 [ qw] : How exact ly does t he dat a collect ion work ?
m e003 [ qy ^ e] : Do t hey have a m ap ,
m e003 [ s^ bu^ e] : and t hen you give t hem a scenario of som e sort ?
m n015 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : Im agine y ou ’re t he [ disfm arker] t he subject .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : You ’re gonna be in here ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : and som ebody [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and y ou see , uh , eit her t h t he t hree − D
m odel , or uh , a QuickTim e anim at ion of st anding u in a square in
Heidelberg .
m n015 [ s] : So you act ually see t hat .
m n015 [ fh] : Um . The uh ,
m n015 [ s] : um , first t hing is you have t o read a t ex t about Heidelberg
.
m n015 [ s] : So , just off a t ext book , uh , t ourist guide , t o fam iliarize ,
uh , y ourself wit h t hat sort of odd − sounding Germ an st reet nam es ,
like Fischergasse and so fort h .
m n015 [ s] : So t hat ’s part one .
m n015 [ s] : Part t wo is , you ’re t old t hat t his huge new , wonderful
com put er syst em ex ist s , t hat can y t ell you everyt hing you want t o

m n015 [ s] : and it underst ands you com plet ely .
m n015 [ s] : And so y ou ’re gonna pick up t hat phone ,
m n015 [ s] : dial a num ber ,
m n015 [ s] : and you get a cert ain am ount of t asks t hat you have t o
solv e .
m n015 [ s] : First you have t o know [ disfm arker] find out how t o get t o
t hat place ,
m n015 [ s] : m aybe wit h t he int ent ion of buying st am ps in t here .
m n015 [ s] : May be [ disfm arker] So , t he next t ask is t o get t o a cert ain
place and t ake a pict ure for your grandchild .
m n015 [ s] : The t hird one is t o get inform at ion on t he hist ory of an

m n015 [ s.%−−] : The fourt h one [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : And t hen t he g syst em breaks down .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : It crashes ,
fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : a At t he t hird ?
m n015 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]

fe004 [ s^ e] : Right t hen ?
m n015 [ s^ ng] : Aft er t he t hird t ask .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : And t hen [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : Or aft er t he fourt h .
m n015 [ s^ co] : Som e find [ disfm arker] @ @ [ com m ent ] Forget t hat for

m n015 [ s^ rt ] : And t hen , a hum an operat or com es on , and
[ disfm arker] and exp apologizes t hat t he syst em has crashed ,
m n015 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : but , you know , urges you t o cont inue , you
know ?
m n015 [ s] : now wit h a hum an operat or .
m n015 [ s] : And so , you have basically t he sam e t asks again ,
m n015 [ s] : just wit h different object s ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : and you go t hrough it again ,
m n015 [ s] : and t hat was it .
m n015 [ fg|s] : Oh , and one [ disfm arker] one lit t le bit [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : w And uh , t he com put er you are [ disfm arker] you are
being t old t he com put er syst em knows exact ly where you are , via GPS
.
m n015 [ s] : When t he hum an operat or com es on , um , t hat person
does not know .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : So t he GPS is crashed as well .
m n015 [ s:qw] : So t he person first has t o ask you " Where are you ? " .
m n015 [ s] : And so y ou have t o do som e [ disfm arker] s t ell t he person
sort of where you are , depending on what you see t here .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : Um , t his is a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker]
a [ disfm arker] a bit t hat I d I don’t t hink we [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ] : Did we discuss t hat bit ?
m n015 [ s] : Uh , I just sort of squeezed t hat in now .
m n015 [ s] : But it ’s som et hing , uh , t hat would provide som e very
int erest ing dat a for som e people I know .
m n015 [ fh] : So .
fe004 [ s.%−] : So , in t he display you can [ disfm arker] Oh , you said t hat
y ou cou y ou m ight have a display t hat shows , like , t he [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : a Addit ionally , y you have a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a
sort of a m ap t ype display .
fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : a w your perspect ive ? sort of ?
fe004 [ s.%−] : And so , as you [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ arp] : Uh , t wo − D .

fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ na^ r] : Two − D .

fe004 [ s] : So as you m ove t hrough it t hat ’s − t hey just t rack it on t he

m n015 [ s^ rt ] : And you see t he label of t he nam e [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : So we get t hose nam es , pronunciat ion st uff , and so fort h
,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : and we can change t hat .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ bu.%−−] : So your t asks don’t require you t o [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ rt ] : I m ean , uh [ disfm arker] yo you ’re t old [ disfm arker] So
when y our t ask is , I don’t know , " Go buy st am ps " or som et hing like
t hat ?

m n015 [ s.%−−] : m aybe t he [ disfm arker] m aybe what you ’re suggest ing
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qy^ bu^ rt ] : Is what you ’re suggest ing t hat it m ight be t oo

m n015 [ s^ bu^ e] : You wanna m have it m ore [ disfm arker] m ore st eps

fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e010 [ s] : and we do have , um , a st udent who is a candidat e for

m e010 [ s] : Uh , she ’s gonna get in t ouch wit h m e .
m e010 [ s] : It ’s a st udent of Ev e ’s .
m e010 [ s] : FEY ,
m e010 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Fey ?

m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ fg|s] : So , anyway , she ’s looking for som e m ore part t im e

m e010 [ s] : And she ’ll be in t ouch .
m e010 [ s] : So we m ay have som eone , uh , t o do t his ,
m e010 [ s] : and she ’s got you know , som e background in
[ disfm arker] in all t his st uff .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : And is a linguist st
m e010 [ fh] : and , so
m e010 [ fg|s] : So . [ v ocalsound] That ’s [ disfm arker] So , Nancy , we ’ll
have an At som e point we ’ll have anot her discussion on exact ly wha t t
y ou know , how t hat ’s gonna go .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : And um , Jane , but also , uh , Liz have offered t o help us
do t his , uh , dat a collect ion and design and st uff .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ s] : So , when we get t o t hat we ’ll have som e people doing it
t hat know what t hey ’re doing .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .

fe004 [ s^ df] : I guess t he reason I was asking about t he sort of t he de
t he det ails of t his kind of t hing is t hat , um , it ’s one t hing t o collect
dat a for , I don’t know , speech recognit ion or various ot her t asks t hat
have pret t y c clear correct answers ,
fe004 [ s] : but wit h int ent ion [ vocalsound] um , obviously , as you point
out , t here ’s a lot of di ot her fact ors
fe004 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] I ’m not really sure , um , how [ disfm arker]
how [ disfm arker] e t he quest ion of how t o m ake it a t appropriat e t oy
v ersion of t hat [ disfm arker] Um , it ’s ju it ’s just hard .
fe004 [ s.%−] : So , I m ean , obviously it ’s a [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ fg|s^ na] : Yeah , uh , act ually I guess t hat was m y quest ion .
m e003 [ qy ] : Is t he int ent ion im plicit in t he scenario t hat ’s given ?
m e003 [ qy .%−] : Like , do t he [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ na.%−] : It is , if t hey have t hese t asks t hat t hey ’re supposed
t o [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ aa|s^ df^ no] : Yeah , I just wasn’t sure t o what level of
det ail t he t ask was .
fe004 [ s.%−] : t o [ disfm arker] t o give [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
fe004 [ %−−] : uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n015 [ s^ ba] : n No one is , at t he m om ent .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : So , we t hat ’s part of what we ’ll have t o figure out .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ fh] : But , uh ,
m e010 [ s^ t ^ t c] : t he [ disfm arker] The problem t hat I was t r gonna t ry
t o focus on t oday was , let ’s suppose by m agic you could collect
dialogues in which , one way or t he ot her , you were able t o , uh ,
figure out bot h t he int ent ion ,
m e010 [ s^ e] : and set t he cont ext ,
m e010 [ s^ e] : and know what language was used .
m e010 [ s] : So let ’s suppose t hat we can get t hat kind of dat a .
m e010 [ fh] : Um .
m e010 [ qh] : The issue is , can we find a way t o , basically , feat urize it
m e010 [ s] : so t hat we get som e discret e num ber of feat ures so t hat ,
uh , when we know t he values t o all t hose feat ures , or as m any as
possible , we can w com e up wit h t he best est im at e of which of t he , in
t his case t hree lit t le int ent ions , are m ost likely .
fe004 [ qw^ rt ] : w What are t he t t hree int ent ions ?
fe004 [ qy ^ bu.%−] : Is it t o go t here , t o see it , and [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ 2] : To com e as close as possible t o it .
m e010 [ s.%−] : Th − t he t erm inology we ’re using is t o [ disfm arker]

fe004 [ s^ aa|%] : Yeah , it ’s @ @ .
m e010 [ s^ co] : Go back .
m e010 [ %−] : To v
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : t o View it .
m e010 [ s^ f] : OK ?
m e010 [ s] : To Ent er it .
m e010 [ s] : Now t hose [ disfm arker] It seem s t o m e t hose are cl you c
y ou hav e no t rouble wit h t hose being dist inct .
m e010 [ s] : " Take a pict ure of it "
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : you [ disfm arker] you m ight well want t o be a really rat her
different place t han ent ering it .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : And , for an object t hat ’s at all big , uh , sort of get t ing t o
t he nearest part of it uh , could be quit e different t han eit her of t hose
.
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : Just sort of [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , so now I underst and t he referent of Tango m ode .
m e003 [ s^ ng] : See , I would hav e t hought it was m ore of a walt z .
fe004 [ s^ df] : I didn’t get t hat before .
m n015 [ %−] : S
m n015 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : To " Walt z " it ?
fe004 [ s^ aa|qh^ e] : Yeah , like , how close are you gonna be ?
m e010 [ %−] : Well .
fe004 [ s^ ba] : Like , [ vocalsound] Tango ’s really close .
m e003 [ s^ aa|s^ df.%−] : Yeah , cuz a t ango [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ fg] : Well , anyway .
m e012 [ %−] : All t hese
m e010 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ bu] : So , like , t he quest ion is how what feat ures can
[ disfm arker] like , do you wanna t ry t o ex t ract from , say , t he parse or
what ev er ?
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e012 [ s^ e.%−−] : Like , t he presence of a word or t he presence of a
cert ain uh , st em , or [ disfm arker] cert ain const ruct ion or what ever .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ qh] : Is t here a const ruct ion , or t he kind of object ,
m e010 [ s^ e] : or w uh , anyt hing else t hat ’s in t he si It ’s eit her in t he
[ disfm arker] in t he s t he discourse it self or in t he cont ext .

m e010 [ s] : So if it t urns out t hat , what ever it is , you want t o know
whet her t he person ’s uh , a t ourist or not , OK ? t hat becom es a
feat ure .
m e010 [ s] : Now , how you det erm ine t hat is anot her issue .
m e010 [ s:s] : But fo for t he current problem , it would just be , " OK , if
y ou can be sure t hat it ’s a t ourist , v ersus a businessm an , versus a
nat iv e , " or som et hing , uh , t hat would give you a lot of discrim inat ory
power
m e010 [ s:s^ fe] : and t hen just have a lit t le sect ion in your belief − net
t hat said , " pppt ! "
m e010 [ s] : Though sin f in t he short run , you ’d set t hem ,
m e012 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : and see ho how it worked ,
m e010 [ s] : and t hen in t he longer run , y ou would figure out how you
could derive t hem . From previous discourse or w any anyt hing else you
knew .
m e012 [ b.%] : Right .
m e012 [ qw] : So , how should [ disfm arker] What ’s t he uh , plan ?
m e012 [ qw^ e.%−] : Like , how should we go about figuring out t hese
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : OK . So , first of all is ,
m e010 [ fh|qy ] : uh , do e eit her of you guys , you got a favorit e belief −
net t hat y ou ’ve , you know , played wit h ?
m e010 [ s^ e] : JavaBayes or som et hing ?
m e012 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e012 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : No , not really .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ fg|s^ co] : Well , anyway . f Get one .
m e010 [ s^ bk|s] : OK ? So [ disfm arker] y so one of t h one of t he t hings
we wanna do is act ually , uh , pick a package ,
m e010 [ s] : doesn’t m at t er which one ,
m e010 [ s] : uh , presum ably one t hat ’s got good int eract ive abilit ies ,
m e010 [ s^ df.%−−] : cuz a lot of what we ’re gonna be d
m e010 [ s] : You know , we don’t need t he one t hat ’ll solve m assive ,
uh , belief − net s quickly .
m e010 [ %−−] : d w
m e010 [ s] : These are not gonna get big in [ disfm arker] in t he
foreseeable fut ure .
m e010 [ s] : But we do want one in which it ’s easy t o int eract wit h and
, uh , m odify .
m e010 [ s^ df] : Because i t hat ’s [ disfm arker] A lot of what it ’s gonna
be , is , um , play ing wit h t his .
m e010 [ s] : And probably one in which it ’s easy t o have , um , what
am ount s t o t ranscript files .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So t hat if [ disfm arker] if we have all t hese cases
[ disfm arker]

m e010 [ s^ f] : OK ?
m e010 [ s] : So we m ake up cases t hat have t hese feat ures ,
m e010 [ s.%−−:s] : OK , and t hen you ’d like t o be able t o say , " OK ,
here ’s a bunch of cases " [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : There ’re even ones t ha t hat you can do learning
m e010 [ s] : OK ? So you have all t heir cases and [ disfm arker] and t heir
result s
m e010 [ s] : and you have a [ disfm arker] algorit hm s t o go t hrough and
run around t ry ing t o set t he [ disfm arker] t he probabilit ies for you .
m e010 [ fh] : Um ,
m e010 [ s] : probably t hat ’s not wort h it .
m e010 [ s^ df] : I m ean , m y guess is we aren’t gonna have enough
dat a t hat ’s good enough t o m ake t he [ disfm arker] t hese dat a fit t ing
ones wort h it ,
m e010 [ s^ df^ no] : but I don’t know .
m e010 [ s] : So I would say you guy t he first t ask for you t wo guys is t o
um , pick a package .
m e010 [ s] : OK , and you wanna it s You know , t he st andard t hings
m e010 [ s^ e.%−−] : y ou want it st able , you want it [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ %] : yeah , @ @ .
m e010 [ s] : And , as soon as we have one , we can st art t rying t o , uh ,
m ake a first cut at what ’s going on .
m n015 [ %−] : An − Nuh .
m e010 [ s] : But it [ disfm arker] what I like about it is it ’s very concret e .
m e010 [ s] : OK ? We [ disfm arker] we have a [ disfm arker] we know what
t he out com es are gonna be ,
m e010 [ s] : and we have som e [ disfm arker] som e dat a t hat ’s loose ,
m e010 [ s] : we can use our own int uit ion ,
m e010 [ s] : and see how hard it is ,
m e010 [ s] : and , im port ant ly , what int erm ediat e nodes we t hink we
need .
m e010 [ s] : So it [ disfm arker] if it t urns out t hat just , t hinking about
t he problem , you com e up wit h t hings you really need t o [ disfm arker]
You know , t his is t he kind of t hing t hat is , you know , an int erm ediat e
lit t le piece in y our belief − net . That ’d be really int erest ing .
m e003 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : And it [ disfm arker] and it m ay serve as a plat form for a
person , m ay be m e , or whoever , who is int erest ed in doing som e
linguist ic analysis .
m n015 [ s] : I m ean , w we hav e t he For − Fram eNet group here ,
m n015 [ s] : and we can see what t hey have found out about t hose
concept s already ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : t hat are cont ained in t he dat a ,
m n015 [ fh|s] : um , you know , t o com e up wit h a nice lit t le set of
feat ures
m n015 [ fh|s] : and um , m aybe ev en m eans of s uh , ext ract ing t hem .

m n015 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and t hat alt oget her could also be
[ disfm arker] uh , becom e a nice paper t hat ’s going t o be published
som ewhere , if we sit down and writ e it .
m n015 [ fh] : And um [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : When you said JavaBayes belief − net you were
t alking about ones t hat run on coffee ?
m n015 [ qrr] : or t hat are in t he program language Java ?
m e010 [ s^ ar|s] : No , t h It t urns out t hat t here is a , uh [ disfm arker]
The new end of Java libraries .
m e010 [ s] : OK , and it t urns out one called
m e010 [ s] : Which is one t hat fair [ disfm arker] people around here use
a fair am ount .
m n015 [ b] : Mm m .
m n015 [ b] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ no.%−−] : I have no idea whet her t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e010 [ s] : The obv ious advant age of t hat is t hat you can t hen ,
relat iv ely easily , get all t he ot her Java packages for GUIs or what ever
else y ou m ight want t o do .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : So t hat i t hat ’s I t hink why a lot of people doing research
use t hat .
m e010 [ s^ bd] : But it m ay not be [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ no] : I have no idea whet her t hat ’s t he best choice
m e010 [ s] : an and t here ’re plent y of people around , st udent s in t he
depart m ent who , you know , live and breat he Bayes − net s .
m e010 [ fh] : So , uh ,
fe004 [ s] : There ’s t he m t ool kit t hat um , Kevin Murphy has
developed ,
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : It ’s OK .
fe004 [ s^ ba] : which m ight be useful t oo .
m e012 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : So , yeah , Kevin would be a good person t o st art wit h .
fe004 [ s] : And it ’s av ailable Mat lab code .
m e010 [ s] : Nancy knows him well .
m e010 [ s^ no] : I don’t know I don’t know whet her you guys have m et
Kevin y et or not ,
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ fh] : but , uh [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , I know him .
m n015 [ %−] : But i
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : But since we all probably are pret t y sure t hat , um , t he
[ disfm arker]

m n015 [ s] : For ex am ple , t his t h t h t he dialogue hist ory is [ disfm arker]
is um , producing XML docum ent s .
m n015 [ s] : M − t hree − L of course is XML .
m n015 [ s.x ] : And t he ont ology t hat um , uh t he st udent is [ disfm arker]
is const ruct ing for m e back in [ disfm arker] in EML is in OIL and t hat ’s
also in XML .
m n015 [ s.x ] : And so t hat ’s where a lot of knowledge about bakeries ,
about hot els , about cast les and st uff is gonna com e from .
m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : Um , so , if it has t hat IO capabilit y and if it ’s a Java
package , it will definit ely be able [ disfm arker] We can couple .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ fg|s] : So , yeah , we ’re sort of [ nonvocalsound] com m it t ed t o
XML as t he kind of , uh , int erchange .
m e010 [ s] : But t hat ’s , you know , not a big deal .
m n015 [ qh^ df] : Who isn’t ,
m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : nuh ?
m e010 [ s] : So , in t erm s of [ disfm arker] of [ disfm arker] int erchanging
in and out of any m odule we build , It ’ll be XML .
m e010 [ s] : And if y ou ’re going off t o queries t o t he ont ology , for
ex am ple , you ’ll hav e t o deal wit h it s int erface .
m e010 [ s] : But t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s fine
m e010 [ fh] : an and um ,
m e010 [ s] : all of t hese t hings have been built wit h m uch bigger
project s t han t his in m ind .
m e010 [ s] : So t hey [ disfm arker] t hey have worked very hard .
m e010 [ s^ e] : It ’s kind of blackboards and m ult i − wave blackboards
m e010 [ s^ e.%−−] : and ways of int erchanging and regist ering your

m e010 [ %−−] : So ,
m e010 [ s] : t hat I don’t t hink is even wort h us worrying about just yet .
m e010 [ s] : I m ean if we can get t he core of t he t hing t o work , in a

m e010 [ s^ e] : I believe .
m e010 [ s.%−] : I don’t [ disfm arker] I don’t see [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ fg|s^ rt ] : Yeah . Yeah , I like , for exam ple , t he [ disfm arker]
what y ou said about t he get t ing input from [ disfm arker] from just files
about where you h where you have t he dat a , have specified t he
feat ures and so fort h .
m n015 [ s] : That ’s , of course , easy also t o do wit h , you know , XML .
m e010 [ s^ na|s^ aa] : Uh , you could have an X [ disfm arker] yeah , you
could m ake and XML form at for t hat . Sure .
m n015 [ %−] : So r

m e010 [ %−−] : That [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ fh] : um ,
m e010 [ s] : you know , feat ure value XML form at is probably as good a
way as any .
m e010 [ s] : So it ’s als Yeah , I guess it ’s also wort h , um , while you ’re
poking around , poke around for XML packages t hat um , do t hings you
’d like .
m e012 [ qy ^ rt ] : Doesn’t [ disfm arker] does Sm art Kom syst em have
such packages ?
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m n015 [ s^ na] : The [ disfm arker] t he lib M − t hree − L library does t hat .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : And t he quest ion is , d you c you [ disfm arker] you ’ll
have t o l We ’ll have t o l
m n015 [ s.%−] : It ’s also [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : That should be [ disfm arker] ay We should be able t o
look at t hat [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ ar] : No ,
m n015 [ %−−] : u u y um
m n015 [ %−−] : t he [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s.%−−] : What I [ disfm arker] What sort of cam e t o m y m ind i is
[ disfm arker] was t he not ion of an idea t hat if [ disfm arker] if t here are l
net s t hat can act ually lear t ry t o set t heir own , um , probabilit y fact ors
based on [ disfm arker] on [ disfm arker] on [ disfm arker] on input
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : which is in file form at ,
m n015 [ s] : if we , um , get really w wild on t his , we m ay act ually want
t o use som e [ disfm arker] som e corpora t hat ot her people m ade
m n015 [ s.%−−] : and , for exam ple , if [ disfm arker] if t hey are in
[ disfm arker] in MATE , t hen we get X M L docum ent s wit h discourse
annot at ions , t
m e012 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : y ou know , t from t he discourse act down t o t he phonet ic
lev el .
m n015 [ s] : Um , Michael has a project where [ disfm arker] you know ,
recognizing discourse act s
m n015 [ s] : and he does it all in MATE ,
m n015 [ s] : and so t hey ’re act ually annot at ing dat a and dat a and
dat a .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : So if we w if we t hink it ’s wort h it one of t hese days ,
not [ disfm arker] not wit h t his first prot ot ype but m aybe wit h a second ,
and we hav e t he possibilit y of [ disfm arker] of t aking input t hat ’s
generat ed elsewhere and learn from t hat , t hat ’d be nice .
m e012 [ b] : Right .

m e010 [ s^ na|s^ nd] : It ’d be nice , but [ disfm arker] but I [ disfm arker] I
[ disfm arker] I do I don’t wanna count on it .
m e010 [ s^ df] : I m ean , you can’t [ disfm arker] you can’t run your
project based on t he speculat ion t hat [ disfm arker] t hat t he dat a will
com e ,
m n015 [ s^ ar|s.%−] : No , no , uh , just for [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ df^ e] : and you don’t have t o act ually design t he net s .
m n015 [ %−−] : Nuh .
m n015 [ s^ df.%−] : Just a back door t hat [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I
t hink we should dev ot e m
m e010 [ s^ am ] : Could happen .
m e010 [ fg|s] : Yeah . So in t erm s of [ disfm arker] of t he , um
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] what t he Sm art Kom gives us for M − t hree
− L packages , it could be t hat t hey ’re fine , or it could be eeh .
m e010 [ s] : You don’t [ disfm arker] You know , you don’t really like it .
m e010 [ s] : So we ’re not [ disfm arker] we ’re not abs we ’re not
required t o use t heir packages .
m e010 [ s.x ] : We are required at t he end t o give t hem st uff in t heir
form at ,
m e010 [ s] : but hey .
m e012 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ fh] : Um ,
m e010 [ fh] : it ’s , uh [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : It doesn’t cont rol what you do in you know , int ernally .
m n015 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e003 [ qw] : What ’s t he t im e fram e for t his ?
m n015 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Two days ?
m e010 [ qw^ br] : Huh ?
m n015 [ s^ r^ rt ] : Two , t hree day s ?
m e010 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah bu w I ’d like t hat t his [ disfm arker] y yeah , t his
week , t o ha t o n t o [ vocalsound] hav e y guys , uh , you know , pick
[ v ocalsound] t he [ disfm arker] y you know , belief − net package
m n015 [ s^ ar.%] : No .
m e010 [ s^ e] : and t ell us what it is , and give us a point er so we can
play wit h it or som et hing .
m e012 [ s^ bk] : Sure .
m e010 [ s] : And , t hen as soon as we have it , I t hink we should st art
t ry ing t o populat e it for t his problem .
m e010 [ s] : Make a first cut at , you know , what ’s going on ,
m e010 [ s] : and probably t he ea easiest way t o do t hat is som e on −
line way .
m e010 [ s] : I m ean , you can f figure out whet her you wanna m ake it a
web sit e
m e010 [ s.%−] : or [ disfm arker] You know , how
m n015 [ fg|%−−] : Uh [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I
[ disfm arker] um , OK , I [ disfm arker] t

m n015 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ df] : I was act ually m ore joking . Wit h t he t wo or t hree days .
m e010 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , I wasn’t .
m n015 [ s.%−] : So t his was [ disfm arker] was a usual jo
m n015 [ s] : Um , it will t ake as long as y y yo you guys need for t hat .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s^ cs.x] : But um , m aybe it m ight be int erest ing if [ disfm arker]
if t he t wo of y ou can agree on who ’s gonna be t he speaker next
Monday , t o t ell us som et hing about t he net you picked ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : and what it does , and how it does t hat .
m e010 [ s^ aap^ cs.x ] : Well , y Well , or bot h of t hem speak .
m e012 [ s^ aa.%] : Sure .
m e010 [ s^ no] : We don’t care .
m n015 [ s^ aa|s^ cs] : Yeah , or y ou can split it up .
m n015 [ %−] : So , y
m e012 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ s.x] : So t hat will be sort of t he assignm ent for next week , is
t o [ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker] for slides and what ever net you picked
m n015 [ s] : and what it can do and [ disfm arker] and how far you ’ve
got t en .
m n015 [ x ] : Pppt !
m e010 [ s^ aap^ cs] : Well , I ’d like t o also , t hough , uh , ha have a
first cut at what t he belief − net looks like .
m e010 [ s^ e] : Even if it ’s really crude .
m e010 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m e010 [ s.%−] : So , you know , here a here are [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ bu] : So we ’re supposed t o @ @ about feat ures and
what not ,
m e003 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right . Yeah .
m e012 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : And , as I said , what I ’d like t o do is ,
m e010 [ s:s] : I m ean , what would be really great is you bring it in
[ disfm arker] If [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] if we could , uh , in t he
m eet ing , say , you know , " Here ’s t he package ,
m e010 [ s:s] : here ’s t he current one we have , "
m e010 [ s:qw] : uh , you know , " What ot her ideas do you have ? "
m e010 [ s] : and t hen we can t hink about t his idea of m aking up t he
dat a file .
m e010 [ %−−] : Of ,
m e010 [ s] : uh , you know , get a [ disfm arker] t a p t ent at ive form at for
it ,
m e010 [ s] : let ’s say XML , t hat says , l y ou know , " These are t he
v arious scenarios we ’ve experienced . "
m e010 [ s.x ] : We can just add t o t hat

m e010 [ s.x ] : and t here ’ll be t his [ disfm arker] t his file of t hem
m e010 [ s] : and when you t hink you ’ve got a bet t er belief − net , You
just run it against t his , um [ disfm arker] t his dat a file .
m e012 [ s^ bu] : So we ’ll be like , hand , uh , doing all t he probabilit ies
.
m e012 [ s^ bk.%] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ aa|s] : Oh , yeah , unt unt il we know m ore .
m e003 [ qw] : And what ’s t he relat ion t o t his wit h [ disfm arker]
Changing t he t able so t hat t he syst em works in English ?
m n015 [ fg] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : So t his is [ disfm arker] Whi − while you were doing t his , I
receiv ed t wo lovely em ails .
m n015 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he full NT and t he full Linux version are
t here .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : I ’v e downloaded t hem bot h ,
m n015 [ s] : and I st art ed t o unpack t he Linux one [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : Uh , t he NT one worked fine .
m n015 [ s] : and I st art ed unt a pack t he Linux one ,
m n015 [ s] : it t old m e t hat I can’t really unpack it
m n015 [ s^ df] : because it cont ains a fut ure dat e .
m n015 [ s] : So t his is t he t im e difference bet ween Germ any .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : I had t o wait unt il one o ’ clock t his aft ernoon before I
was able t o unpack it .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : Now , um [ disfm arker] Then it will be m y job t o get t his
whole t hing running bot h on Swede and on t his m achine .
m n015 [ s] : And so t hat we have it .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : And t hen um [ disfm arker] Hopefully t hat [ disfm arker]
hoping t hat m y urgent m essage will now com e t hrough t o Ralph and
Tilm an t hat it will send som e m ore docum ent at ion along ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : we [ disfm arker] I cont rol p
m n015 [ s] : May be t hat ’s what I will do next Monday
m n015 [ s^ e] : is show t he st at e and show t he syst em and show t hat .
m e010 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e010 [ fg|s] : Yeah . So t he answer , Johno , is t hat t hese are , at t he
m om ent , separat e .
m e010 [ s] : Uh , what one hopes is t hat when we underst and how t he
analy zer works , we can bot h worry about convert ing it t o English and
worry about how it could ex ext ract t he param et ers we need for t he
belief − net .
m e003 [ s] : I guess m y quest ion was m ore about t im e fram e .
m e003 [ s] : So we ’re gonna do belief − net s t his week ,
m e003 [ %−] : and t hen [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ no] : Oh , yeah . I don’t know .
m e010 [ s] : n None of t his is i n Neit her of t hese project s has got a
real t ight t im e − line ,

m e010 [ s] : in t he sense t hat over t he next m ont h t here ’s a
[ disfm arker] t here ’s a deliverable .
m e003 [ b] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : S so uh , it ’s opport u in t hat sense it ’s opport unist ic .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : If [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] you know , if we don’t get
any inform at ion for t hese guys f for several weeks t hen we aren’t
gonna sit around , y ou know , wast ing t im e , t rying t o do t he problem
or guess what t hey [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : You know , just pppt !
m e010 [ s] : go on and do ot her t hings .
m e003 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ fg|s] : Yeah , but uh [ disfm arker] but t he uh [ disfm arker] This
point is really [ disfm arker] I t hink very , very valid t hat ult im at ely we
hope t hat [ disfm arker] t hat bot h will m erge int o a harm onious and ,
um , wonderful , um , st at e
m n015 [ s:s] : where we can not only do t he bare necessit ies , IE ,
changing t he t able so it does exact ly in English what it does in Germ an
, but also t hat we can sort of hav e t he syst em where we can say , " OK
, t his is what it usually does ,
m n015 [ s] : and now we add t his lit t le t hing t o it " ,
m n015 [ s^ f] : you know ?
m n015 [ s.%−−] : what ever ,
m n015 [ s] : Johno ’s and Bhaskara ’s great belief − net ,
m n015 [ s] : and we plug it in ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : and t hen for t hese cert ain t asks ,
m n015 [ s] : and we know t hat navigat ional t asks are gonna be a core
dom ain of t he new sy st em ,
m n015 [ s] : it all [ disfm arker] all of a sudden it does m uch bet t er .
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Nuh ?
m n015 [ s^ df] : Because it can produce bet t er answers ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : t ell t he person , as I s showed you on t his m ap ,
m n015 [ s] : n y ou know , produce eit her you know , a red line t hat
goes t o t he Vist a point
m n015 [ s] : or a red line t hat goes t o t he Tango point
m n015 [ s] : or red line t hat goes t o t he door ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : which would be great .
m n015 [ s] : So not only can you show t hat you know som et hing
sensible but ult im at ely , if you produce a syst em like t his , it t akes t he
person where it want s t o go .
m n015 [ s] : Rat her t han t aking him always t o t he geom et ric cent er of a
building ,
m e012 [ b] : Mm m .
m n015 [ s] : which is what t hey do now .
m n015 [ s] : And we even had t o t ake out a bit .
m n015 [ s] : Nancy , you m issed t hat part .

m n015 [ s] : We had t o t ake out a bit of t he road work .
m n015 [ s] : So t hat it doesn’t t ake you t o t he wall [ vocalsound] every
t im e .
fe004 [ qy^ bh] : Oh , really ?
m n015 [ fh] : So . Um [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : So t his was act ually an act ual problem t hat we
encount ered ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : which nobody have [ disfm arker] has [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ df] : because car navigat ion syst em s don’t really care .
m n015 [ s] : You know , t hey get you t o t he beginning of t he st reet ,
m n015 [ s] : som e now do t he house num ber .
fe004 [ b] : Hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : But even t hat is problem at ic .
m n015 [ s^ rt .%−−] : If you go d If y ou wanna drive t o t he SAP in Waldorf ,
m n015 [ s] : I ’m sure t he sam e is t rue of Microsoft ,
m n015 [ s] : it t akes you t o t he [ disfm arker] t he address ,
m n015 [ s^ rt .%−−] : what ever , st reet num ber blah − blah − blah ,
m n015 [ s] : y ou are m iles away from t he ent rance .
m e010 [ b] : Yep .
m n015 [ s^ df] : Because t he s post al address is m aybe a m ailbox
som ewhere .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Nuh ?
m n015 [ s] : but t he ent rance where you act ually wanna go is
som ewhere com plet ely different .
m n015 [ s] : So unless you ’re a m ail person you really don’t wanna go
t here .
fe004 [ b] : Right , yeah .
m e010 [ s] : Probably not t hen ,
m e010 [ s^ df] : cuz y you probably can’t drop t he m ail t here anyway .
m n015 [ s^ na] : Probably neit her [ disfm arker] e not even t hat .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e010 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : Clear ?
m e012 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : OK . Sounds good .
m e003 [ s^ t c] : The Powder − Tower is m ade of red lim est one .

[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qy ] : Is t here a lot s of sam ple dat a t hat is beyond what you
[ disfm arker] what you have t here ?
m n015 [ s^ na] : There [ disfm arker] t here ’s m ore t han I showed ,
m n015 [ s^ df] : but um , um , I t hink t his is sort of um , in part m y job t o
look at t hat
m n015 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and t o see whet her t here are feat ures in
t here t hat can be ex t ract ed ,
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : and t o com e up wit h som e feat ures t hat are not you know
, em pirically based on [ disfm arker] on a real experim ent or on
[ disfm arker] on [ disfm arker] on realit y
fe004 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s:s^ fe] : but sort of on y our int uit ion of you know , " Aha !
