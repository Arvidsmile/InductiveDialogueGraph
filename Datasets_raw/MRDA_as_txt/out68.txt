m n007 [ z] : Eight , eight ?
m e018 [ z] : we ’re going .
m n052 [ z] : This is t hree .
m n052 [ z] : Yep .
m n007 [ z] : Three .
m n052 [ z] : Yep .
m e013 [ z] : Test .
m e013 [ z] : Hm m .
m e013 [ z] : Let ’s see .
m e013 [ z] : Move it bit .
m e013 [ z] : Test ?
m e013 [ z] : Test ?
m e013 [ z] : OK ,
m e013 [ z] : I guess it ’s alright .
m e013 [ fg] : So ,
m e013 [ fh] : let ’s see .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah , Barry ’s not here and Dave ’s not here .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−] : Um , I can say about [ disfm arker] just q just quickly
t o get t hrough it , t hat Dave and I subm it t ed t his ASRU .
m e018 [ qy ^ d.%−−] : This is for
m e018 [ s^ bk] : ASRU .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Yeah , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s int erest ing .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , basically we ’re dealing wit h rever reverberat ion ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : and , um , when we deal wit h pure reverberat ion , t he
t echnique he ’s using works really , really well .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , and when t hey had t he reverberat ion here , uh , we
’ll m easure t he signal − t o − noise rat io
m e013 [ s] : and it ’s , uh , about nine DB .
m n052 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So ,
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : a fair am ount of [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : You m ean , from t he act ual , uh , recordings ?
m n052 [ %] : k
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : It ’s nine DB ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : And act ually it brought up a quest ion which m ay be
relev ant t o t he Aurora st uff t oo .
m e013 [ s] : Um , I know t hat when you figured out t he filt ers t hat we
’re using for t he Mel scale , t here was som e ex perim ent at ion t hat went
on at [ disfm arker] at , uh [ disfm arker] at OGI .

m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s] : but one of t he differences t hat we found bet ween t he t wo
sy st em s t hat we were using , [ com m ent ] t he [ disfm arker] t he Aurora
HTK sy st em baseline syst em [ com m ent ] and t he syst em t hat we were
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he uh , ot her syst em we were using , t he
uh , t he SRI syst em , was t hat t he SRI syst em had m aybe a , um ,
hundred hert z high − pass .
m n052 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ s] : And t he , uh , Aurora HTK , it was like t went y .
m n052 [ s^ 2] : S sixt y − four .
m n052 [ s^ nd^ r] : S sixt y − four .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d^ m ] : Sixt y − four ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m n052 [ s] : if you ’re using t he baseline .
m e013 [ qy^ rt ] : Is t hat t he ba band cent er ?
m n052 [ s^ ar] : No ,
m n052 [ s^ nd] : t he edge .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : The edge is really , uh , sixt y − four ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ s] : For som e reason , uh , Dave t hought it was t went y ,
m n052 [ s] : So t he , uh , cent er would be som ewhere around like
hundred
m e013 [ %−−] : but .
m n052 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] hundred and [ disfm arker] hundred
[ disfm arker] hundred and [ disfm arker] m aybe [ disfm arker] it ’s like
[ disfm arker] fi hundred hert z .
m e013 [ qw] : But do you know , for inst ance , h how far down it would
be at t went y hert z ?
m e013 [ qw] : What t he [ disfm arker] how m uch reject ion would t here be
at t went y hert z , let ’s say ?
m n052 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : At t went y hert z .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ qy] : any idea what t he curve looks like ?
m n052 [ s] : Twent y hert z frequency [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s|qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Oh , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s zero at t went y hert z ,
right ?
m n052 [ s^ e] : The filt er ?
m n007 [ s^ nd] : Yea − act ually , t he left edge of t he first filt er is at sixt y
− four .
m n052 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Sixt − s sixt y − four .
m n007 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : So any t hing less t han sixt y − four is zero .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .

m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : It ’s act ually set t o zero ?
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : What kind of filt er is t hat ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−] : Is t his [ disfm arker] oh , from t he [ disfm arker] from
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %−−] : It [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : This is t he filt er bank in t he frequency dom ain t hat st art s
at six t y − four .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : Oh , so you , uh [ disfm arker] so you really set it t o zero
, t he FFT ?
m n052 [ b] : Yeah ,
m n052 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s a weight on t he ball spect rum .
m n052 [ s^ e] : Triangular weight ing .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ fg] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a lit t le different t han Dave
t hought , I t hink .
m e013 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker] but ,
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ s] : st ill , it ’s possible t hat we ’re get t ing in som e m ore noise .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : So I wonder , is it [ disfm arker] @ @ Was t here
[ disfm arker] t heir experim ent at ion wit h , uh , say , t hrowing away t hat
filt er or som et hing ?
m e013 [ fh] : And , uh [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Uh , t hrowing away t he first ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ h] : Um ,
m n052 [ s^ bk|s] : yeah , we [ disfm arker] we ’ve t ried including t he full
[ disfm arker] full bank .
m n052 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m n052 [ s^ e] : From zero t o four K .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : And t hat ’s always worse t han using sixt y − four hert z .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right ,
m e013 [ s^ ng] : but t he quest ion is , whet her sixt y − four hert z is
[ disfm arker] is , uh , t oo , uh , low .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n052 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : I m ean , m ake it a hundred or so ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : I t I t hink I ’ve t ried a hundred and it was m ore or less t he
sam e , or slight ly worse .

m e013 [ qw^ d] : On what t est set ?
m n052 [ s] : On t he sam e , uh , SpeechDat − Car ,
m n052 [ s] : Aurora .
m e013 [ fg|s^ nd] : Um , it was on t he SpeechDat − Car .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : So I t ried a hundred t o four K .
m n052 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : Um ,
m n052 [ s.%−] : So it was [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : and on [ disfm arker] and on t he , um , um ,
[ v ocalsound] TI − digit s also ?
m n052 [ s^ ar] : No , no , no .
m n052 [ s^ df^ nd] : I t hink I just t ried it on SpeechDat − Car .
m e013 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : That ’d be som et hing t o look at som et im e
m e013 [ s^ df] : because what , um , eh , he was looking at was
perform ance in t his room .
m n052 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy .%−−] : Would t hat be m ore like [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Well , you ’d t hink t hat ’d be m ore like SpeechDat − Car ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : I guess ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : in t erm s of t he noise .
m e013 [ s] : The SpeechDat − Car is m ore , uh , sort of roughly
st at ionary , a lot of it .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And [ disfm arker] and TI − digit s m aybe is not so m uch
as [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : Well , m aybe it ’s not a big deal .
m e013 [ fh] : But , um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Anyway , t hat was just som et hing we wondered about .
m e013 [ fh] : But , um ,
m e013 [ s] : uh , cert ainly a lot of t he noise , uh , is , uh , below a
hundred hert z .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , t he signal − t o − noise rat io , you know , looks a fair
am ount bet t er if y ou [ disfm arker] if you high − pass filt er it from t his
room .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : But , um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : but it ’s st ill pret t y noisy .
m e013 [ s] : Ev en [ disfm arker] even for a hundred hert z up , it ’s
[ disfm arker] it ’s st ill fairly noisy .

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : The signal − t o − noise rat io is [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] is
act ually st ill pret t y bad .
m e018 [ qy^ bh] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So , um ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : I m ean , t he m ain [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu|qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : So t hat ’s on t h t hat ’s on t he f t he far field
ones t hough , right ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s^ na] : t hat ’s on t he far field .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ na] : Yeah , t he near field ’s pret t y good .
m e018 [ qw] : So wha what is , uh [ disfm arker] what ’s causing t hat ?
m e013 [ s] : Well , we got a [ disfm arker] a video project or in here ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ fh|s^ e] : and , uh [ disfm arker] which we keep on during every
[ disfm arker] every session we record ,
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : which , you know , I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] w we
were aware of
m e013 [ s^ df] : but [ disfm arker] but we t hought it wasn’t a bad t hing .
m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , t hat ’s a nice noise source .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , and t here ’s also t he , uh [ disfm arker] uh , air
condit ioning .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s^ e] : Which , uh , you know , is a pret t y low frequency kind of
t hing .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker] but , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So , t hose are [ disfm arker] t hose are m ajor com ponent s , I
t hink ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ s^ e] : uh , for t he st at ionary kind of st uff .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ fh] : but , um ,
m e013 [ %−−] : it , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I guess , I [ disfm arker] m aybe I said t his last week t oo
m e013 [ s] : but it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it really becam e apparent
t o us t hat we need t o [ disfm arker] t o t ake account of noise .
m e013 [ fh] : And , uh ,

m e013 [ s] : so I t hink when [ disfm arker] when he get s done wit h his
prelim st udy I t hink [ vocalsound] one of t he next t hings we ’d want t o
do is t o t ake t his , uh [ disfm arker] uh , noise , uh , processing st uff
and [ disfm arker] and , uh [ disfm arker] uh , synt hesize som e speech
from it .
m e013 [ %−] : And t hen [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : When are his prelim s ?
m e013 [ h|s] : Um , I t hink in about , um , a lit t le less t han t wo weeks .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Wow .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , it m ight even be sooner .
m e013 [ fh|qy ^ d^ rt ^ t 1] : Uh , let ’s see , t his is t he sixt eent h ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ t 1] : sevent eent h ?
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ no.%−−] : Yeah , I don’t know if he ’s before
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : It m ight even be in a week .
m e018 [ fg] : So , I
m e013 [ s^ r] : A week ,
m e018 [ b] : Huh .
m e013 [ s] : week and a half .
m e018 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I guessed t hat t hey were gonna do it som e
t im e during t he sem est er
m e018 [ s^ bu|qy ^ d^ g] : but t hey ’ll do it any t im e , huh ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : They seem t o be [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Well , t he sem est er act ually is st art ing up .
m e018 [ qh^ rt ] : Is it already ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s^ df^ na] : t he sem est er ’s lat e [ disfm arker] lat e August t hey
st art here .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Yikes .
m e013 [ s] : So t hey do it right at t he beginning of t he sem est er .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : So , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat was sort of one
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−−] : I m ean ,
m e013 [ s] : t he overall result s seem ed t o be first place in [ disfm arker]
in [ disfm arker] in t he case of eit her , um , art ificial reverberat ion or a
m odest sized t raining set .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , eit her way , uh , i uh , it helped a lot .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : And [ disfm arker] But if you had a [ disfm arker] a really
big t raining set , a recognizer , uh , syst em t hat was capable of t aking
advant age of a really large t raining set [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I t hought t hat [ disfm arker] One t hing wit h t he HTK is t hat is
has t he [ disfm arker] as we ’re using [ disfm arker] t he configurat ion we
’re using is w s is [ disfm arker] being bound by t he t erm s of Aurora ,
m e013 [ s] : we have all t hose param et ers just set as t hey are .
m e013 [ s^ e] : So ev en if we had a hundred t im es as m uch dat a , we
wouldn’t go out t o , you know , t en or t or a hundred t im es as m any
Gaussians or anyt hing .
m e013 [ fh] : So ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : um , it ’s kind of hard t o t ake advant age of [ disfm arker]
of [ disfm arker] of big chunks of dat a .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ b] : Mm m , y eah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , whereas t he ot her one does sort of expand as you
have m ore t raining dat a .
m e013 [ s^ e] : It does it aut om at ically , act ually .
m e013 [ fh] : And so ,
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ s] : t hat one really benefit ed from t he larger set .
m e013 [ s^ df] : And it was also a div erse set wit h different noises and
so fort h .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh , so , um ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : t hat , uh [ disfm arker] t hat seem ed t o be [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So , if y ou have t hat [ disfm arker] t hat bet t er recognizer
t hat can [ disfm arker] t hat can build up m ore param et ers , and if you ,
um , hav e t he nat ural room , which in t his case has a p a pret t y bad
signal − t o − noise rat io , t hen in t hat case , um , t he right t hing t o do is
just do [ disfm arker] u use speaker adapt at ion . And [ disfm arker] and
not bot her wit h [ disfm arker] wit h t his acoust ic , uh , processing .
m e013 [ s] : But I t hink t hat t hat would not be t rue if we did som e
ex plicit noise − processing as well as , uh , t he convolut ional kind of
t hings we were doing .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s] : That ’s sort of what we found .
m n052 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ s^ t c] : I , um [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] uh , st art ed working on
t he uh [ disfm arker] Mississippi St at e recognizer .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Oh ,
m e018 [ fh|s] : So , I got in t ouch wit h Joe and [ disfm arker] and , uh ,
from y our em ail and t hings like t hat .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s] : And , uh , t hey added m e t o t he list [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ s^ e] : uh , t he m ailing list .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n052 [ s^ ba] : great .
m e018 [ s] : And he gave m e all of t he point ers and everyt hing t hat I
needed .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : And so I downloaded t he , um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : There were t wo t hings , uh , t hat t hey had t o download .
m e018 [ s] : One was t he , uh , I guess t he soft ware .
m e018 [ s] : And anot her wad [ disfm arker] was a , um , sort of like a
sam ple [ disfm arker] a sam ple run .
m e018 [ s] : So I downloaded t he soft ware and com piled all of t hat .
m e018 [ s] : And it com piled fine .
m n052 [ s^ ba] : Eight .
m n052 [ s^ ba] : Oh , eh , great .
m e018 [ s] : No problem s .
m e018 [ fh|s] : And , um , I grabbed t he sam ple st uff
m e018 [ s] : but I hav en’t , uh , com piled it .
m n052 [ s^ bu|qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : That sam ple was released only yest erday
or t he day before , right ?
m e018 [ s^ ar] : No [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ ng] : Well , I haven’t grabbed t hat one yet .
m e018 [ s^ df^ ng] : So t here ’s t wo .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Oh , t here is anot her short sam ple set [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ na] : There was anot her short one ,
m n052 [ s] : o o sam ple .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s] : And so I haven’t grabbed t he lat est one t hat he just , uh ,
put out y et .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : F Yeah , OK .
m e018 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ s] : Um , but , t he soft ware seem ed t o com pile fine and
ev ery t hing ,
m e018 [ fh] : so .
m e018 [ fh] : And , um ,
m e018 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t here any word yet about t he issues about , um ,
adjust m ent s for different feat ure set s or anyt hing ?
m e018 [ s^ ar] : No ,
m e018 [ %−−] : I [ disfm arker] I d
m e018 [ s^ df] : You asked m e t o writ e t o him
m e018 [ s^ df^ nd] : and I t hink I forgot t o ask him about t hat .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ nd] : Or if I did ask him , he didn’t reply .
m e018 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t rem em ber yet .

m e018 [ fh|s^ cc] : Uh , I ’ll [ disfm arker] I ’ll d I ’ll double check t hat and
ask him again .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : it ’s like t hat [ disfm arker] t hat could r t urn out t o be an

m n052 [ b] : Mm m .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk^ r] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : Cuz t hey have it [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : May be I ’ll send it t o t he list .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : Cuz t hey have , uh , already frozen t hose in i insert ion
penalt ies and all t hose st uff is what [ disfm arker] I feel .
m n052 [ s^ df] : Because t hey have t his docum ent explaining t he
recognizer .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m n052 [ s] : And t hey have t hese t ables wit h , uh , various language

m n052 [ %−] : u
m e018 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , I haven’t seen t hat one yet .
m n052 [ s] : Uh , it ’s t h it ’s t here on t hat web .
m e018 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ s.%−] : And , uh , on t hat , I m ean , t hey have run som e

[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : And so t hey ’ve picked [ disfm arker] t he values .
m n052 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : Yeah , I t hink t hey pi p
m n052 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : yeah , t hey picked t he values from [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e018 [ s^ bk^ r] : OK .
m e013 [ qw^ d] : For r w what t est set ?

m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : So I guess about eleven t housand param et ers ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ e] : which [ disfm arker] act ually shouldn’t be a problem ,

m n007 [ s^ na] : It should be OK .
m e018 [ qw.%−] : so what is different bet ween t his and [ disfm arker] and

m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ba] : That ’s great .
m n007 [ s] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not bad ,

m e018 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : Wh − what ’s t he baseline you need t o be under ?
m e018 [ s^ e^ rt ] : Two hundred ?
m e013 [ s^ no] : Well , we don’t know .
m e013 [ s^ df] : They ’re st ill arguing about it .
m n007 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s^ e] : I m ean , if it ’s t wo [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] if it ’s , uh
[ disfm arker] if it ’s t wo − fift y , t hen we could keep t he delt a where it is
if we shav ed off t went y .
m e013 [ s^ e] : If it ’s t wo hundred , if we shaved off t went y , we could
[ disfm arker] we could , uh , m eet it by m oving t he delt a back .
m e018 [ qw] : So , how do you know t hat what you have is t oo m uch if
t hey ’re st ill deciding ?
m e013 [ s^ no] : Uh , we don’t ,
m e013 [ %−−] : but it ’s just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ df] : I m ean , t he m ain t hing is t hat since t hat we got
burned last t im e , and [ disfm arker] you know , by not worrying about it
v ery m uch , we ’re just st aying conscious of it .
m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ %−−] : And so , t h

m e013 [ s:s^ co] : I m ean , if [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] if a week
before we have t o be done som eone says , " Well , you have t o have
fift y m illiseconds less t han you have now " , it would be pret t y frant ic
around here .
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Ah , OK .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ ba] : But st ill , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a pret t y big , uh ,
win .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : And it doesn’t seem like you ’re [ disfm arker] in t erm s of

m e013 [ s] : He added a bit on ,
m n007 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s^ df] : I guess , because before we were [ disfm arker] we were
[ disfm arker] had [ disfm arker] were able t o have t he noise , uh , st uff ,
uh , and t he LVA be in parallel .
m e013 [ s^ df] : And now he ’s [ disfm arker] he ’s requiring it t o be done
first .
m n007 [ fg|s] : Well , but I t hink t he m ain t hing , m aybe , is t he cleaning
of t he speech , which t akes fort y m illiseconds or so .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Well , so you say [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : let ’s say t en m illiseconds [ disfm arker] seconds for t he LDA
.
m n007 [ s^ ng] : and [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] t he LDA is , well ,
pret t y short right now .
m e013 [ s] : Well , t en .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen fort y for t he ot her .
m n052 [ s^ bu|qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Yeah , t he LDA [ disfm arker] LDA
[ disfm arker] we don’t know , is , like [ disfm arker] is it very crucial for
t he feat ures , right ?
m n007 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n007 [ %−−] : I just [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ df] : This is t he first t ry .
m n007 [ s^ am ] : I m ean , I [ disfm arker] m ay be t he LDA ’s not very

m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right ,
m n052 [ %−−] : S s h
m e013 [ s] : so you could st art pulling back ,
m e013 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ b] : Yeah ,
m n052 [ %−−] : l
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But I t hink you hav e [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s^ bu] : I m ean , you hav e t went y for delt a com put at ion
m e013 [ s^ e] : which y now you ’re sort of doing t wice ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e013 [ qy^ rt ] : But yo w were you doing t hat before ?
m n007 [ h] : Mm m .
m n052 [ %−] : On t he [ disfm arker] in t he [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Well , in t he proposal , um , t he input of t he VAD net work
were just t hree fram es , I t hink .
m n052 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s^ 2.%−] : Just [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , just t he st at ic , no delt a .
m n007 [ s^ e] : Uh , st at ic feat ures .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : So , what you have now is fort uh , fort y for t he
[ disfm arker] t he noise , t went y for t he delt a , and t en for t he LDA .
m e013 [ s] : That ’s sevent y m illiseconds of st uff which was form erly in

m n007 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So I t hink ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : you know , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he difference as far

m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and you could ex perim ent wit h cut t ing various pieces

m e013 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , we ’re s we ’re not [ disfm arker] we ’re not in

m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ ba^ na] : It ’s pret t y good .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not like it ’s adding up t o four

m e018 [ qw] : Where [ disfm arker] where is t his [ disfm arker] where is
t his fift y − seven point O t wo in [ disfm arker] in com parison t o t he last

m e013 [ s] : Well , it ’s [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s bet t er t han anyt hing , uh
, any body got .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy^ bh] : Oh , is t hat right ?
m n007 [ s] : The best was fift y − four point five .

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ %−] : Point s
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : And our syst em was fort y − nine ,
m e013 [ %−] : Uh

m e013 [ s] : Wit h t he f wit h t he neural net .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n052 [ b] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ %−] : and r and [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %] : It would
m n052 [ s] : so t his is [ disfm arker] t his is like t he first proposal .
m n052 [ s^ e] : The proposal − one .
m n052 [ s^ e] : It was fort y − four , act ually .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And we st ill don’t have t he neural net in .
m e013 [ %−−] : So [ disfm arker] so it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ ba^ fe] : Wow .
m e013 [ fh] : You know .
m e013 [ %−−] : So it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : We ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re doing bet t er .

m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : So , our ,
m e013 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , you can see t he kind of [ disfm arker] kind of
num bers t hat we ’re having , say , on SpeechDat − Car
m e013 [ s^ ba^ e] : which is a hard t ask ,

m e013 [ s] : cuz it ’s really , um [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s just sort of
[ disfm arker] sort of reasonable num bers , st art ing t o be .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−] : I m ean , it ’s st ill t erri
m n007 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , even for a well − m at ched case it ’s sixt y
percent error rat e reduct ion ,
m n007 [ %−−] : which is [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ r] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Probably half .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Good !
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So act ually , t his is in bet ween [ vocalsound] what we had
wit h t he prev ious VAD and what Sunil did wit h an IDL VAD .
m n007 [ s^ e|qy^ d^ g] : Which gave sixt y − t wo percent im provem ent ,
right ?
m n052 [ s^ aa|s^ aap] : Yeah , it ’s alm ost t hat .
m n007 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : It ’s alm ost an average
m n052 [ s.%−−] : som ewhere around [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qw^ br^ rt ] : What was t hat ?
m e018 [ s^ co^ rt ] : Say t hat last part again ?
m n007 [ s.%−−] : So , if you use , like , an IDL VAD , uh , for dropping t he
fram es ,
m n052 [ %] : o o
m n052 [ s^ 2] : Or t he best we can get .
m n007 [ s^ m ^ na^ rt ] : t he best t hat we can get [ disfm arker] i That
m eans t hat we est im at e t he silence probabilit y on t he clean version of

m n007 [ s] : Then y ou can go up t o sixt y − t wo percent error rat e
reduct ion , globally .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So t hat would be even [ disfm arker] That
wouldn’t change t his num ber down here t o sixt y − t wo ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−] : So y ou [ disfm arker] you were get
m n007 [ s] : If you add a g good v very good VAD , t hat works as well as
a VAD working on clean speech ,
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .

m n007 [ s.%−] : t hen you wou you would go [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : So t hat ’s sort of t he best you could hope for .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ na] : Probably . Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So fi si fift y − t hree is what you were get t ing wit h t he
old VAD .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : And , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu] : and sixt y − t wo wit h t he [ disfm arker] t he , you know ,
quot e , unquot e , cheat ing VAD .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : And fift y − seven is what you got wit h t he real VAD .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : That ’s great .
m n007 [ fh|s^ t c.%−−] : Uh , yeah , t he next t hing is , I st art ed t o play
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Well , I don’t want t o worry t oo m uch about t he delay ,
m n007 [ s^ ar] : no .
m n007 [ s^ cs] : Maybe it ’s bet t er t o wait
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ s^ e] : for t he decision
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : from t he com m it t ee .
m n007 [ fh|s] : Uh , but I st art ed t o play wit h t he , um , [ vocalsound]
[ v ocalsound] uh , t andem neural net work .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m
m n007 [ s] : I just did t he configurat ion t hat ’s very sim ilar t o what we
did for t he February proposal .
m n007 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : So . There is a f a first feat ure st ream t hat use uh
st raight MFCC feat ures .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : Well , t hese feat ures act ually .
m n007 [ s] : And t he ot her st ream is t he out put of a neural net work ,
using as input , also , t hese , um , cleaned MFCC .
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s.%−] : I don’t have t he com p
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Those are t h t hose are t h what is going int o
t he t andem net ?
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m ?
m e018 [ s^ e^ rt ] : Those t wo ?
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : So t here is just t his feat ure st ream , [ com m ent ] t he
fift een MFCC plus delt a and double − delt a .
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ?

m n007 [ fh|s^ rt ] : Um , so it ’s [ disfm arker] m akes fort y − five feat ures
[ com m ent ] t hat are used as input t o t he HTK .
m n007 [ s] : And t hen , t here is [ disfm arker] t here are m ore input s t hat

m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , oh .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ s] : h he likes t o use t hem bot h ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : cuz t hen it has one part t hat ’s discrim inat ive ,
m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ df] : one part t hat ’s not .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ fg] : So , um ,
m n007 [ fh] : uh , y eah .
m n007 [ s] : Right now it seem s t hat [ disfm arker] i I just t est ed on
SpeechDat − Car while t he experim ent are running on your [ disfm arker]
on TI − digit s .
m n007 [ s] : Well , it im proves on t he well − m at ched and t he
m ism at ched condit ions ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : but it get worse on t he highly m ism at ched .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : Com pared t o t hese num bers ?
m n007 [ s^ na] : Com pared t o t hese num bers , yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : like , on t he well − m at ch and m edium m ism at ch , t he

m e013 [ %] : y
m n007 [ s] : but it goes down a lot m ore , like fift een percent on t he HM

m e013 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : You ’re just using t he full ninet y feat ures ?
m n007 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n007 [ %−−] : The [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : Y you have ninet y feat ures ?
m n007 [ %−] : i
m n007 [ %−−] : I hav e ,
m n007 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : From t he net works , it ’s t went y − eight .
m n007 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : And from t he ot her side it ’s fort y − five .
m n007 [ s^ na] : So , d i It ’s fort y − fiv e .
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] you have sevent y − t hree feat ures ,
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s^ bu] : and y ou ’re just feeding t hem like t hat .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy^ d] : There isn’t any KLT or any t hing ?
m n007 [ s^ nd] : There ’s a KLT aft er t he neural net work , as
[ disfm arker] as before .
m e018 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : That ’s how you get down t o t went y − eight ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : Why t went y − eight ?
m n007 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m n007 [ fh] : Uh .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n007 [ s^ df] : It ’s [ disfm arker] i i i It ’s because it ’s what we did for
t he first proposal .
m n007 [ s^ e] : We t est ed , uh , t rying t o go down
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Ah .
m e013 [ s^ j] : It ’s a m ult iple of sev en .
m n007 [ fh] : and
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fg] : Um .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ df] : I want ed t o do som et hing very sim ilar t o t he proposal
as a first [ disfm arker] first t ry .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : That m akes sense .
m n007 [ s] : But we have t o [ disfm arker] for sure , we have t o go down ,
m n007 [ s^ df] : because t he lim it is now sixt y feat ures .
m n007 [ fh] : So ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : uh ,
m n007 [ s] : we hav e t o find a way t o decrease t he num ber of feat ures
.
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fg|s.%−−] : So , it seem s funny t hat [ disfm arker] I don’t know ,
m ay be I don’t u quit e underst and everyt hing , [ com m ent ] but t hat
adding feat ures [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : I guess [ disfm arker] I guess if you ’re keeping t he back −
end fixed .
m e018 [ s^ am ] : May be t hat ’s it .
m e018 [ s^ df] : Because it seem s like just adding inform at ion shouldn’t
giv e worse result s .

m e018 [ s.%−−] : But I guess if y ou ’re keeping t he num ber of Gaussians
fixed in t he recognizer , t hen [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Well , yeah .
m n007 [ b.%] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But , I m ean , just in general , adding inform at ion
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ df] : Suppose t he inform at ion you added , well , was a really
t errible feat ure and all it brought in was noise .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker] so , um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ df] : Or [ disfm arker] or suppose it wasn’t com plet ely t errible
,
m e013 [ s^ df] : but it was com plet ely equivalent t o anot her one
feat ure t hat y ou had ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : ex cept it was noisier .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e013 [ s] : In t hat case you wouldn’t necessarily expect it t o be bet t er
at all .
m e018 [ s^ bk|s^ ng] : Oh , yeah , I wasn’t necessarily saying it should
be bet t er .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : I ’m just surprised t hat you ’re get t ing fift een percent
relat iv e worse on t he wel
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ s] : But it ’s worse .
m e013 [ s^ 2] : On t he highly m ism at ched condit ion .
m e018 [ s^ e^ m ^ na] : On t he highly m ism at ch .
m n007 [ %] : Yeah , I [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So , " highly m ism at ched condit ion " m eans t hat in fact
y our t raining is a bad est im at e of y our t est .
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : So hav ing [ disfm arker] having , uh , a g a l a great er
num ber of feat ures , if t hey aren’t m aybe t he right feat ures t hat you
use , cert ainly can e can easily , uh , m ake t hings worse .
m e013 [ s^ na] : I m ean , you ’re right .
m e013 [ s] : If y ou hav e [ disfm arker] if you have , uh , lot s and lot s of

[ disfm arker] your t raining is represent at ive of your t est , t hen get t ing
m ore sources of inform at ion should just help .
m e013 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but it ’s [ disfm arker] It doesn’t necessarily
work t hat way .
m e018 [ b] : Huh .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ %−−] : So I wonder ,

m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ qw] : Well , what ’s your [ disfm arker] what ’s your t hought
about what t o do nex t wit h it ?
m n007 [ h] : Um ,
m n007 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m n007 [ s] : I ’m surprised ,
m n007 [ s^ df] : because I expect ed t he neural net t o help m ore when
t here is m ore m ism at ch , as it was t he case for t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ qy ^ rt ] : So , was t he t raining set sam e as t he p t he February

m n052 [ %] : OK .
m n007 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , it ’s t he sam e t raining set ,
m n007 [ s^ e^ na^ rt ] : so it ’s TIMIT wit h t he TI − digit s ’ , uh , noises , uh
, added .

m e013 [ s^ e] : Again .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ %−−] : But ,
m e013 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] The ot her t hing is , I m ean , before you found
t hat was t he best configurat ion , but you m ight have t o ret est t hose
t hings now t hat we have different [ disfm arker] The rest of it is different
,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ fh] : So ,
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ qw] : For inst ance , what ’s t he effect of just put t ing t he neural

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , you know what t he st raight feat ures do .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : That gives you t his .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : You know what it does in com binat ion .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : You don’t necessarily know what [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw.%−−] : What if you did t he [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Would it m ake sense t o do t he KLT on t he full set of
com bined feat ures ?
m e018 [ s^ e.%−−] : Inst ead of just on t he [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ na] : I g I guess .

m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s^ df] : The reason I did it t his ways is t hat in February , it
[ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] we t est ed different t hings like t hat ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : so , having t wo KLT , having just a KLT for a net work , or
having a global KLT .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see .
m n007 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu] : So y ou t ried t he global KLT before
m n007 [ fg] : Well [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : and it didn’t really [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %−−] : And , uh , t h
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ df] : The differences bet ween t hese configurat ions were not
huge ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n007 [ s^ df] : but [ disfm arker] it was m arginally bet t er wit h t his
configurat ion .
m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ fg|s^ cs] : But , yeah , t hat ’s obviously anot her t hing t o t ry ,
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ s^ df] : since t hings are [ disfm arker] t hings are different .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And I guess if t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : These are all [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu] : so all of t hese sev ent y − t hree feat ures are going int o ,
um , t he , uh [ disfm arker] t he HMM .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ rt ] : And is [ disfm arker] are [ disfm arker] i i are
[ disfm arker] are any delt as being com put ed of t ha of t hem ?
m n007 [ s^ na] : Of t he st raight feat ures , yeah .
m n007 [ %−] : So .
m e013 [ s^ bu.%−] : n Not of t he [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : But n t h t he , um ,
m n007 [ s] : t andem feat ures are u used as t hey are .
m e013 [ s^ 2] : Are not .
m n007 [ fh] : So ,
m n007 [ s^ bk|s^ cs] : yeah , m aybe we can add som e cont ext from
t hese feat ures also as [ disfm arker] Dan did in [ disfm arker] in his last
work .
m e013 [ s^ na] : Could .
m e013 [ %] : i
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but t he ot her t hing I was t hinking was ,

m e013 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Uh , now I lost t rack of what I was t hinking .
m e013 [ fh] : But .
m e018 [ qw.%−−] : What is t he [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : You said t here was a lim it of sixt y feat ures or
som et hing ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ qw] : What ’s t he relat ion bet ween t hat lim it and t he , um ,
fort y − eight [ disfm arker] uh , fort y eight hundred bit s per second ?
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh ,
m e013 [ s] : I know what I was gonna say .
m n007 [ h|s] : Um , not [ disfm arker] no relat ion .
m e013 [ s] : No relat ion .
m e018 [ s] : So I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I don’t underst and ,
m n007 [ s] : The f t he fort y − eight hundred bit s is for t ransm ission of
som e feat ures .
m e018 [ s^ df.%−] : because i
m e018 [ s.%−] : I m ean , if you ’re only using h
m n007 [ s] : And generally , i it [ disfm arker] s allows you t o t ransm it like
, fift een , uh , cepst rum .
m e013 [ s] : The issue was t hat , um , t his is supposed t o be a
st andard t hat ’s t hen gonna be fed t o som ebody ’s recognizer
som ewhere
m e013 [ s^ e] : which m ight be , you know , it [ disfm arker] it m ight be a
concern how m any param et ers are use [ disfm arker] u used and so
fort h .
m e013 [ fh] : And so ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ s] : t hey felt t hey want ed t o set a lim it .
m e013 [ s] : So t hey chose sixt y .
m e013 [ s] : Som e people want ed t o use hundreds of param et ers
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and t hat bot hered som e ot her people .
m e013 [ fh] : u And so
m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : t hey just chose t hat .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s kind of r
arbit rary t oo .
m e013 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s kind of
what was chosen .
m e013 [ s^ t c] : I [ disfm arker] I rem em bered what I was going t o say .
m e013 [ s^ am ] : What I was going t o say is t hat , um , m aybe
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] m ay be wit h t he noise rem oval , uh , t hese
t hings are now m ore correlat ed .
m e013 [ s^ df] : So you have t wo set s of t hings t hat are kind of
uncorrelat ed , uh , wit hin t hem selves ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : but t hey ’re pret t y correlat ed wit h one anot her .

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : And , um ,
m e013 [ s] : t hey ’re being fed int o t hese , uh , variant s , only
Gaussians and so fort h ,
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and , uh ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s^ cs] : so m aybe it would be a bet t er idea now t han it was
before t o , uh , have , uh , one KLT over everyt hing ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ e] : t o de − correlat e it .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , I see .
m e013 [ s^ am ] : Maybe .
m e013 [ fh] : You know .
m n052 [ qw^ rt ] : What are t he S N Rs in t he t raining set , TIMIT ?
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : It ’s , uh , ranging from zero t o clean ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ r] : From zero t o clean .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ t c] : So we found t his [ disfm arker] t his , uh [ disfm arker] t his
Macrophone dat a , and so fort h , t hat we were using for t hese ot her
ex perim ent s , t o be pret t y good .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker] i aft er you explore t hese ot her
alt ernat ives , t hat m ight be anot her way t o st art looking , is
[ disfm arker] is just im proving t he t raining set .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , we were get t ing , uh , lot s bet t er recognit ion
using t hat , t han [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Of course , you do have t he problem t hat , um , u i
[ com m ent ] we are not able t o increase t he num ber of Gaussians , uh ,
or any t hing t o , uh , uh , t o m at ch anyt hing .
m e013 [ s] : So we ’re only im proving t he t raining of our feat ure set ,
m e013 [ s] : but t hat ’s st ill probably som et hing .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So you ’re saying , add t he Macrophone dat a t o
t he t raining of t he neural net ? The t andem net ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : t hat ’s t he only place t hat we can t rain .
m e013 [ s^ df] : We can’t t rain t he ot her st uff wit h anyt hing ot her t han
t he st andard am ount ,
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ fh] : so .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : What [ disfm arker] what was it t rained on again ?

m e018 [ s^ e] : The one t hat you used ?
m n007 [ s] : It ’s TIMIT wit h noise .
m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ s^ e] : So , yeah , it ’s rat her a sm all [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ qw] : How big is t he net , by t he way ?
m n007 [ h|s] : Uh , it ’s , uh , five hundred hidden unit s .
m n007 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu] : And again , you did experim ent s back t hen where you
m ade it bigger
m e013 [ s^ bu] : and it [ disfm arker] and t hat was [ disfm arker] t hat was
sort of t he t hreshold point .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : Much less t han t hat , it was worse ,
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : and
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : m uch m ore t han t hat , it wasn’t m uch bet t er .
m e013 [ fh] : Hm m .
m n052 [ qy^ rt ] : So is it [ disfm arker] is it t hough t he perform ance , big
relat ion in t he high m a high m ism at ch has som et hing t o do wit h t he ,
uh , cleaning up t hat you [ disfm arker] t hat is done on t he TIMIT aft er
adding noise ?
m n007 [ b] : Yeah . @ @ ?
m n007 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n052 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ bu] : it ’s [ disfm arker] i All t he noises are from t he TI − digit s
,
m n052 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ %−−] : So y ou [ disfm arker] i
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : Well , it it ’s like t he high m ism at ch of t he SpeechDat − Car
m n007 [ %−] : They [ disfm arker] k uh [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : aft er cleaning up , m aybe having m ore noise t han t he
[ disfm arker] t he t raining set of TIMIT aft er clean [ disfm arker] s aft er
y ou do t he noise clean − up .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n052 [ s] : I m ean , earlier you never had any com pensat ion ,
m n052 [ s] : y ou just t rained it st raight away .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : So it had like all t hese different condit ions of S N Rs ,
act ually in t heir t raining set of neural net .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n052 [ s^ bu|qy ^ d^ g] : But aft er cleaning up you have now a different
set of S N Rs , right ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ e] : For t he t raining of t he neural net .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ qy] : is it som et hing t o do wit h t he m ism at ch t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat ’s creat ed aft er t he cleaning up , like t he high m ism at ch
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ qy^ bu^ d.%−−] : You m ean t he [ disfm arker] t he m ost noisy
occurrences on SpeechDat − Car m ight be a lot m ore noisy t han
[ disfm arker]
m n052 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ %−−] : Of [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : I m ean , t he SNR aft er t he noise com pensat ion of t he
SpeechDat − Car .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh ,
m e013 [ s^ aa] : so [ disfm arker] Right .
m e013 [ s] : So t he t raining [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he neural
net is being t rained wit h noise com pensat ed st uff .
m n007 [ s^ am ] : Maybe .
m n052 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ b] : y eah .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : Which m akes sense ,
m e013 [ fh|s^ bs] : but , uh , you ’re say ing [ disfm arker] Yeah , t he
noisier ones are st ill going t o be , even aft er our noise com pensat ion ,
are st ill gonna be pret t y noisy .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , so now t he aft er − noise com pensat ion t he
neural net is seeing a different set of S N Rs t han t hat was originally
t here in t he t raining set . Of TIMIT .
m n052 [ s^ df] : Because in t he TIMIT it was zero t o som e clean .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yes .
m n052 [ s^ df] : So t he net saw all t he SNR @ @ condit ions .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n052 [ s] : Now aft er cleaning up it ’s a different set of SNR .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n052 [ s] : And t hat SNR m ay not be , like , com covering t he whole
set of S N Rs t hat y ou ’re get t ing in t he SpeechDat − Car .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right ,

m e013 [ s^ ng] : but t he SpeechDat − Car dat a t hat you ’re seeing is
also reduced in noise
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah , y eah ,
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : by t he noise com pensat ion .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : yeah , it is .
m n052 [ s^ df] : But , I ’m saying , t here could be som e [ disfm arker]
som e issues of [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : Well , if t he init ial range of SNR is different , we
[ disfm arker] t he problem was already t here before .
m n007 [ fh.%] : And [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ %−−] : Because [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm m [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah , I m ean , it depends on whet her you believe t hat
t he noise com pensat ion is equally reducing t he noise on t he t est set
and t he t raining set .
m n007 [ b] : Hm m .
m n052 [ s^ t 1] : On t he t est set , yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , you ’re saying t here ’s a m ism at ch in noise t hat
wasn’t t here before ,
m n052 [ b] : Hm m .
m n052 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : but if t hey were bot h t he sam e before , t hen if t hey were
bot h reduic reduced equally , t hen , t here would not be a m ism at ch .
m e013 [ fh] : So ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , t his m ay be [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Heav en forbid , t his noise com pensat ion process m ay be
im perfect ,
m e013 [ fh] : but .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh ,
m n007 [ %] : Yeah , uh [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ fg] : Well , I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : so m aybe it ’s t reat ing som e t hings different ly .
m n052 [ fg] : I don’t know .
m n052 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I just [ disfm arker] t hat could be seen from
t he TI − digit s , uh , t est ing condit ion
m n052 [ s^ df|qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : because , um , t he noises are from t he TI −
digit s , right ?

m n052 [ s^ e] : Noise [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : So cleaning up t he TI − digit s
m n052 [ s.%−] : and if t he perform ance goes down in t he TI − digit s
m ism at ch [ disfm arker] high m ism at ch like t his [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Clean t raining , yeah .
m n052 [ s^ na] : on a clean t raining , or zero DB t est ing .
m n007 [ s] : Yeah , we ’ll [ disfm arker] so we ’ll see .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Uh .
m n052 [ s] : Then it ’s som et hing t o do .
m n007 [ s^ am ] : Maybe .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , one of t he t hings about [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , t he Macrophone dat a , um , I t hink , you know , it
was recorded over m any different t elephones .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : And , um ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : so , t here ’s lot s of different kinds of acoust ic condit ions
.
m e013 [ s^ e] : I m ean , it ’s not art ificially added noise or anyt hing .
m e013 [ s^ df] : So it ’s not t he sam e .
m e013 [ s] : I don’t t hink t here ’s anybody recording over a car from a
car ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : but [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s varied
enough t hat if [ disfm arker] if doing t his adjust m ent s , uh , and playing
around wit h it doesn’t , uh , m ake it bet t er , t he m ost [ disfm arker] uh ,
it seem s like t he m ost obvious t hing t o do is t o im prove t he t raining

m e013 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , what we were [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : uh [ disfm arker] t he condit ion [ disfm arker] It [ disfm arker] it
gave us an enorm ous am ount of im provem ent in what we were doing
wit h Meet ing Recorder digit s ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : ev en t hough t here , again , t hese m Macrophone digit s
were v ery , very different from , uh , what we were going on here .
m e013 [ s^ df] : I m ean , we weren’t t alking over a t elephone here .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : But it was just [ disfm arker] I t hink just having a
[ disfm arker] a nice v ariat ion in acoust ic condit ions was just a good
t hing .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Yep .
m n052 [ b] : Mm m .

m n007 [ s] : Yeah , act ually [ vocalsound] t o s eh , what I observed in
t he HM case is t hat t he num ber of delet ion dram at ically increases .
m n007 [ s^ e] : It [ disfm arker] it doubles .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : Num ber of delet ions .
m n007 [ s] : When I added t he num t he neural net work it doubles t he
num ber of delet ions .
m n007 [ s^ no] : Yeah , so I don’t y ou know [ vocalsound] how t o
int erpret t hat ,
m n007 [ fh] : but , m m m [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ na] : Me eit her .
m n007 [ %] : t
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : And [ disfm arker] and did [ disfm arker] an ot her

m e018 [ s^ e] : Roughly ?
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ s] : They are a lit t le bit bet t er .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah . But [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Did t hey increase t he num ber of delet ions even for t he

m e013 [ s^ e.%−] : Say , for t he [ disfm arker] I m ean , it [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ ar] : No , it doesn’t .
m n007 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s only t he highly m ism at ched ?
m e013 [ s^ co] : And it [ disfm arker] Rem ind m e again ,
m e013 [ s^ bu.%−] : t he " highly m ism at ched " m eans t hat t he
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ 2.%−−] : Clean t raining and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw] : Uh , sorry ?
m n007 [ s.%−−] : It ’s clean t raining [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Well , close m icrophone t raining and dist ant m icrophone ,
um , high speed , I t hink .

m n007 [ fh] : Well [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : The m ost noisy cases are t he dist ant m icrophone for

m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Well , m aybe t he noise subt ract ion is subt ract ing off

m n007 [ s^ 2] : Separat ing .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ %] : Wh
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : I m ean , but wit hout t he neural net work it ’s [ disfm arker]

m n007 [ s.%−] : The feat ure are t he sam e except t hat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , right .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Uh , t hat ’s right , t hat ’s right .
m e013 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : Well t hat [ disfm arker] t hat says t hat , you know , t he , um
[ disfm arker] t he m odels in [ disfm arker] in , uh , t he recognizer are

m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ fh] : Uh .
m e013 [ fg] : But , y eah ,
m e013 [ s] : act ually [ disfm arker] [ nonvocalsound] t he TIMIT noises
[ pause] are sort of a range of noises
m e013 [ s^ bu|qy ^ d^ g] : and t hey ’re not so m uch t he st at ionary

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : " Babble " , it ’s a st at ionary background plus som e voices

m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : Well , I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat if you run it
[ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s] : Act ually , you [ disfm arker] m aybe you rem em ber t his .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : When you [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in t he old
ex perim ent s when y ou ran wit h t he neural net only , and didn’t have
t his side pat h , um , uh , wit h t he [ disfm arker] t he pure feat ures as
well , did it m ake t hings bet t er t o have t he neural net ?
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy^ rt ] : Was it about t he sam e ?
m e013 [ fh] : Uh , w i
m n007 [ s^ nd] : It was [ disfm arker] b a lit t le bit worse .
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : Than [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ s] : Than just t he feat ures ,
m n007 [ fh] : y eah .
m e013 [ fg] : So ,
m e013 [ s^ bu] : unt il you put t he second pat h in wit h t he pure feat ures
, t he neural net wasn’t helping at all .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Well , t hat ’s int erest ing .
m n007 [ s] : It was helping , uh , if t he feat ures are b were bad ,
m n007 [ fh] : I m ean .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ e] : Just plain P L Ps or M F
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : C Cs .
m n007 [ s.%−] : as soon as we added LDA on − line norm alizat ion , and
[ v ocalsound] all t hese t hings , t hen [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : They were doing sim ilar enough t hings .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Well , I st ill t hink it would be k sort of int erest ing t o see
what would happen if you just had t he neural net wit hout t he side
t hing .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ b] : m m − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ df] : And [ disfm arker] and t he t hing I [ disfm arker] I have in
m ind is , uh , m ay be you ’ll see t hat t he result s are not just a lit t le bit
worse .
m e013 [ s^ df] : Maybe t hat t hey ’re a lot worse .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : You know ?
m e013 [ fh] : And , um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : But if on t he ha ot her hand , uh , it ’s , say , som ewhere in
bet ween what you ’re seeing now and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker]
and , uh , what y ou ’d have wit h just t he pure feat ures , t hen m ay be
t here is som e problem of a [ disfm arker] of a , uh , com binat ion of
t hese t hings , or correlat ion bet ween t hem som ehow .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : If it really is t hat t he net is hurt ing you at t he m om ent ,
t hen I t hink t he issue is t o focus on [ disfm arker] on , uh , im proving t he
[ disfm arker] t he net .

m n007 [ b] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ b] : m m − hm m .
m e013 [ fg] : Um .
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : So what ’s t he ov erall effe
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , you haven’t done all t he experim ent s
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : but you said it was i som ewhat bet t er , say , five
percent bet t er , for t he first t wo condit ions , and fift een percent worse
for t he ot her one ?
m e013 [ s] : But it ’s [ disfm arker] but of course t hat one ’s weight ed
lower ,
m n007 [ b] : Y y eah , oh .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : so I wonder what t he net effect is .
m n007 [ s] : I d I [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] it was one or t wo
percent .
m n007 [ s^ df] : That ’s not t hat bad ,
m n007 [ s] : but it was l like t wo percent relat ive worse on SpeechDat −
Car .
m n007 [ s^ df] : I hav e t o [ disfm arker] t o check t hat .
m n007 [ s^ cc] : Well , I have [ disfm arker] I will .
m n052 [ s] : Well , it will [ disfm arker] overall it will be st ill bet t er
m n052 [ s^ e] : even if it is fift een percent worse ,
m n052 [ s^ df] : because t he fift een percent worse is given like f w
t went y − fiv e [ disfm arker] point t wo five eight .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : So t he [ disfm arker] so t he worst it could be , if t he ot hers
were ex act ly t he sam e , is four ,
m n052 [ %−] : Is it like [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ na] : Yeah , so it ’s four .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−] : and [ disfm arker] and , uh , in fact since t he ot hers
are som ewhat bet t er [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ %] : Is i
m n052 [ s] : So eit her it ’ll get cancelled out , or you ’ll get , like ,
alm ost t he sam e .
m n007 [ s] : Yeah , it was [ disfm arker] it was slight ly worse .
m e013 [ fh.%] : Uh .
m n052 [ s^ 2] : Slight ly bad .
m n052 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s] : Yeah , it should be pret t y close t o cancelled out .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : You know , I ’ve been wondering about som et hing .

m e018 [ s] : In t he , um [ disfm arker] a lot of t he , um [ disfm arker] t he
Hub − fiv e sy st em s , um , recent ly have been using LDA .
m e018 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and t hey , um [ disfm arker] They run LDA
on t he feat ures right before t hey t rain t he m odels .
m e018 [ s^ e] : So t here ’s t he [ disfm arker] t he LDA is [ disfm arker] is
right t here before t he H M
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : So , you guys are using LDA
m e018 [ s^ bu] : but it seem s like it ’s pret t y far back in t he process .
m n052 [ s^ ng] : Uh , t his LDA is different from t he LDA t hat you are
t alking about .
m n052 [ s^ df] : The LDA t hat you [ disfm arker] saying is , like , you t ake
a block of feat ures , like nine fram es or som et hing , [ com m ent ] and
t hen do an LDA on it ,
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n052 [ s^ df] : and t hen reduce t he dim ensionalit y t o som et hing like
t went y − four or som et hing like t hat .
m e018 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , you c you c you can .
m n052 [ s^ df] : And t hen feed it t o HMM .
m e018 [ s.%−] : I m ean , it ’s [ disfm arker] y ou know , you ’re just
basically i
m n052 [ fg|s] : Yeah , so t his is like a t wo d t wo dim ensional t ile .
m e018 [ s] : You ’re shift ing t he feat ure space .
m e018 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ r] : So t his is a t wo dim ensional t ile .
m n052 [ s] : And t he LDA t hat we are f applying is only in t im e ,
m n052 [ s^ e] : not in frequency [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ e] : high cost frequency .
m n052 [ s] : So it ’s like [ disfm arker] m ore like a filt ering in t im e ,
m n052 [ s^ e.%−] : rat her t han doing a r
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Ah . OK .
m e018 [ qw.%−−] : So what i what about , um [ disfm arker] i u what i w
m e018 [ s^ no] : I m ean , I don’t know if t his is a good idea or not ,
m e018 [ qw] : but what if you put [ disfm arker] ran t he ot her kind of LDA
, uh , on your feat ures right before t hey go int o t he HMM ?
m n052 [ %] : Uh , it [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : No , act ually , I t hink [ disfm arker] i
m n052 [ %] : m
m n007 [ fh] : Well .
m n007 [ s] : What do we do wit h t he ANN is [ disfm arker] is som et hing
like t hat
m n007 [ s^ e] : ex cept t hat it ’s not linear .
m n007 [ s] : But it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s like a nonlinear discrim inant
analy sis .

m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Right ,
m e018 [ %−−] : it ’s t he [ disfm arker] It ’s [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e018 [ %−−] : The [ disfm arker] So [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %−] : But .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : Yeah , so it ’s sort of like [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : The t andem st uff is kind of like i nonlinear LDA .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ %−−] : It ’s [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ %−−] : I g
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Uh .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : But I m ean , w but t he ot her feat ures t hat you have ,
um , t h t he non − t andem ones ,
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : Yeah , I know .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : That [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : Well , in t he proposal , t hey were t ransform ed u using PCA
,
m n007 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ s] : Yeah , it m ight be t hat LDA could be bet t er .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : The a t he argum ent i is kind of i in [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : and it ’s not like we really know ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but t he argum ent anyway is t hat , um , uh , we always
have t he prob
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , discrim inat ive t hings are good .
m e013 [ s^ e] : LDA , neural net s , t hey ’re good .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df] : Uh , t hey ’re good because you [ disfm arker] you
[ disfm arker] you learn t o dist inguish bet ween t hese cat egories t hat
y ou want t o be good at dist inguishing bet ween .
m e013 [ s] : And PCA doesn’t do t hat .
m e013 [ s^ df] : It [ disfm arker] PAC − PCA [ disfm arker] low − order PCA
t hrows away pieces t hat are uh , m aybe not [ disfm arker] not gonna be
helpful just because t hey ’re sm all , basically .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ fh|s] : But , uh , t he problem is , t raining set s aren’t perfect
and t est ing set s are different .
m e013 [ s] : So you f y ou [ disfm arker] you face t he pot ent ial problem
wit h discrim inat ive st uff , be it LDA or neural net s , t hat you are t raining
t o discrim inat e bet ween cat egories in one space

m e013 [ s] : but what you ’re really gonna be g get t ing is [ disfm arker] is
som et hing else .
m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : And so , uh , St ephane ’s idea was , uh , let ’s feed , uh ,
bot h t his discrim inat ively t rained t hing and som et hing t hat ’s not .
m e013 [ s^ df] : So you have a good set of feat ures t hat every body ’s
worked really hard t o m ake ,
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df] : and t hen , uh , you [ disfm arker] you discrim inat ely t rain
it ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : but y ou also t ake t he pat h t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
doesn’t have t hat ,
m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s^ df] : and put t ing t hose in t oget her .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t hat [ disfm arker] t hat seem
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s kind of like a com binat ion of t he [ disfm arker] uh ,
what , uh , Dan has been calling , y ou know , a feat ure [ disfm arker] uh
, you know , a feat ure com binat ion versus post erior com binat ion or
som et hing .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s , you know , you have t he post erior
com binat ion
m e013 [ s] : but t hen you get t he feat ures from t hat and use t hem as a
feat ure com binat ion wit h t hese [ disfm arker] t hese ot her t hings .
m e013 [ s] : And t hat seem ed , at least in t he last one , as he was just
say ing , he [ disfm arker] he [ disfm arker] when he only did discrim inat ive
st uff , i it act ually was [ disfm arker] was [ disfm arker] it didn’t help at all
in t his part icular case .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df] : There was enough of a difference , I guess , bet ween
t he t est ing and t raining .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But by having t hem bot h t here [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : The fact is som e of t he t im e , t he discrim inat iv e st uff is
gonna help y ou .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And som e of t he t im e it ’s going t o hurt you ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : and by com bining t wo inform at ion sources if , you know
[ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s^ bu.%−] : So you wouldn’t necessarily t hen want t o do LDA on
t he non − t andem feat ures because now you ’re doing som et hing t o
t hem t hat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−] : That i i
m e013 [ s^ na] : I t hink t hat ’s count er t o t hat idea .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : Now , again , it ’s [ disfm arker] we ’re just t rying t hese
different t hings .

m e018 [ b] : right .
m e013 [ s^ df] : We don’t really know what ’s gonna work best .
m e013 [ s^ df^ na] : But if t hat ’s t he hypot hesis , at least it would be
count er t o t hat hypot hesis t o do t hat .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s] : and in principle you would t hink t hat t he neural net would
do bet t er at t he discrim inant part t han LDA .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : Though , m aybe not .
m e018 [ fg] : Well [ disfm arker] y
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Ex act ly .
m e018 [ s] : I m ean , we , uh [ disfm arker] we were get t ing ready t o do
t he t andem , uh , st uff for t he Hub − fiv e syst em ,
m e018 [ fh|s] : and , um , Andreas and I t alked about it ,
m e018 [ s:s] : and t he idea w t he t hought was , " Well , uh , yeah , t hat
i y ou know [ disfm arker] t h t he neural net should be bet t er ,
m e018 [ s^ cs] : but we should at least have uh , a num ber , you know ,
t o show t hat we did t ry t he LDA in place of t he neural net ,
m e018 [ s^ df] : so t hat we can you know , show a clear pat h .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e018 [ s] : You know , t hat you have it wit hout it ,
m e018 [ s] : t hen you have t he LDA ,
m e018 [ s] : t hen you have t he neural net ,
m e018 [ s] : and y ou can see , t heoret ically .
m e018 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : I was just wondering [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ba^ na] : Well , I t hink t hat ’s a good idea .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Did [ disfm arker] did you do t hat
m e013 [ qrr.%−] : or [ disfm arker] t ha t hat ’s a [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ ar] : Um . No .
m e018 [ s^ df] : That ’s what [ disfm arker] t hat ’s what we ’re gonna do
next
m e018 [ s^ df] : as soon as I finish t his ot her t hing .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : No , well , t hat ’s a good idea .
m e013 [ %−−] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b.%] : i Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : We just want t o show .
m e018 [ s^ df] : I m ean , it [ disfm arker] everybody believes it ,

m e013 [ s^ ar] : Oh , no
m e013 [ s.%−] : it ’s a g
m e018 [ s.%−−] : but y ou know , we just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No , no ,
m e013 [ s] : but it m ight not [ disfm arker] not even be t rue .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : I m ean , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
[ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s a great idea .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , one of t he t hings t hat always dist urbed m e , uh ,
in t he [ disfm arker] t he resurgence of neural net s t hat happened in t he
eight ies was t hat , um , a lot of people [ disfm arker] Because neural

at all int o t he linear , uh [ disfm arker] uh , versions of t hem .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s] : And , uh , people were doing recurrent net s but not
looking at IIR filt ers ,
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] You know , I m ean , uh ,
m e013 [ s] : so I t hink , yeah , it ’s definit ely a good idea t o t ry it .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e018 [ s^ df] : and everybody ’s put t ing t hat on t heir [ vocalsound]
sy st em s now ,
m e018 [ %−−] : and so , I
m e018 [ s] : t hat ’s what m ade m e wonder about t his ,
m e013 [ s^ ng] : Well , t hey ’ve been put t ing t hem in t heir syst em s off

m e018 [ fh] : but .
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] but , uh ,
m e018 [ s^ bk|s^ df^ ng] : Yeah , what I m ean is it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
like in t he Hub − fiv e evaluat ions , you know ,
m e018 [ s^ df] : and you read t he syst em descript ions and everybody ’s

m e013 [ s^ 2] : And now t hey all hav e t hat .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e018 [ fh] : And so .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fh] : Uh .
m n007 [ s] : It ’s t he t ransform at ion t hey ’re est im at ing on [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ s^ bk|s^ nd] : Yeah , so it ’s different .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e018 [ s^ aa] : ex act ly .

m e018 [ s^ df] : Cuz t hey don’t have t hese , you know , m ism at ches t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat you guys have .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , part of why [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink part of why you were

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ fg] : So , yeah ,
m n052 [ s^ t c] : I ’ve been exploring a parallel VAD wit hout neural

m n052 [ s^ e] : wit h , like , less lat ency using SNR and energy , um ,
aft er t he cleaning up .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : So what I ’d been t rying was , um ,
m n052 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : Aft er t he b aft er t he noise com pensat ion , n I was t rying t
t o f find a f feat ure based on t he rat io of t he energies , t hat is , cl aft er

m n052 [ s] : So t hat if [ disfm arker] if t hey are , like , pret t y c close t o
one , which m eans it ’s speech .
m n052 [ s] : And if it is n if it is close t o zero , which is [ disfm arker] So it
’s like a scale @ @ probabilit y v alue .
m n052 [ s] : So I was t rying , uh , wit h full band and m ult iple bands ,

m n052 [ s] : m ps uh [ disfm arker] separat ing t hem t o different

m n052 [ s] : and deriving separat e decisions on each bands , and
t ry ing t o com bine t hem .
m n052 [ fh] : Uh ,
m n052 [ s] : t he adv ant age being like it doesn’t have t he lat ency of t he

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : g And [ pause] it gave m e like , uh , one point [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ fh] : Um ,

m n052 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker] u
m e013 [ fg] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ fa] : i d I ’m sorry ,
m e013 [ qy ] : does it st ill have t he m edian [ pause] filt er st uff ?
m n052 [ s^ ba] : It st ill has t he m edian filt er .
m e013 [ s] : So it st ill has m ost of t he delay ,
m n052 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : it just doesn’t [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n052 [ s] : so d wit h t he delay , t hat ’s gone is t he input , which is t he

m n052 [ s^ e] : The fort y plus [ pause] t went y .
m n052 [ s] : At t he input of t he neural net you have t his , uh , f nine

m e013 [ s^ bk] : right .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ s] : So t hat delay , plus t he LDA .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n052 [ s.%−−] : So t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] di t he biggest
[ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : The problem f for m e was t o find a consist ent t hreshold
t hat works [ pause] well across t he different dat abases ,
m n052 [ s^ df] : because I t I t ry t o m ake it work on t r SpeechDat − Car
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s^ df] : and it fails on TI − digit s ,

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ fh] : So ,
m n052 [ fh] : um .
m n052 [ s] : So t here are [ disfm arker] t here was , like , som e problem
in balancing t he delet ions and insert ions when I t ry different

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ %−−] : The [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : I ’m st ill t rying t o m ake it bet t er by using som e ot her

m n052 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qw^ cs^ rt ] : What about using it in t he neural net ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ s^ na.%−] : event ually we could [ disfm arker] could just
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n052 [ s^ aa] : so [ disfm arker] Yeah ,
m n052 [ s.%−−] : so t hat ’s t he [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ na] : So we ’ve been t hinking about put t ing it int o t he

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ df] : Because t hey did [ disfm arker] t hat it self [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Then you don’t have t o worry about t he t hresholds and
[ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ na] : There ’s a t hreshold
m n052 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] Yeah .
m n052 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ fh] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s , uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %−−] : but just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : So if we [ disfm arker] if we can live wit h t he lat ency or

uh , good t hing .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|qy ^ rt ] : Um , anybody [ disfm arker] has any body [ disfm arker]
y ou guy s or [ disfm arker] or Naren , uh , som ebody , t ried t he , uh , um
, second t h second st ream t hing ?
m n052 [ s^ na] : Oh , I just [ disfm arker] I just h put t he second st ream

m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m n052 [ s^ df] : but just like [ disfm arker] just t o know t hat everyt hing is

m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n052 [ s] : So it was like , uh , fort y − fiv e cepst rum plus t went y − t hree
m el [ disfm arker] log m el .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and , just , like , it gave m e t he baseline

m n052 [ s^ e] : which is like zero im provem ent .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ df] : So I just t ried it on It alian just t o know t hat everyt hing
is [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : But I [ disfm arker] I didn’t ex port anyt hing out of it
m n052 [ s^ df] : because it was , like , a weird feat ure set .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ co] : Well , what I t hink , you know , would be m ore what you

m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?

m e013 [ %−−] : And t hen [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : But ,
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : yeah , we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re not quit e t here yet .
m e013 [ s^ co] : So we have t o [ vocalsound] figure out t he neural net s
, I guess .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : The uh , ot her t hing I was wondering was , um , if t he
neural net , um , has any [ disfm arker] because of t he different noise
con unseen noise condit ions for t he neural net ,
m n052 [ s^ e] : where , like , you t rain it on t hose four noise condit ions
, while y ou are feeding it wit h , like , a addit ional [ disfm arker] som e
four plus som e [ disfm arker] f few m ore condit ions which it hasn’t seen
, act ually ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s^ e] : from t he [ disfm arker] f f while t est ing .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n052 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ qy.%−−] : inst ead of just h having c uh , t hose cleaned up t
cepst rum , sh should we feed som e addit ional inform at ion , like
[ disfm arker] The [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : We hav e t he VAD flag .
m n052 [ qy ] : I m ean , should we f feed t he VAD flag , also , at t he input
so t hat it [ disfm arker] it has som e addit ional discrim inat ing inform at ion
at t he input ?
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Hm m − hm m !
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw^ br^ d^ rt ] : Wh − uh , t he [ disfm arker] t he VAD what ?
m n052 [ s] : We hav e t he VAD inform at ion also av ailable at t he back −

m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : So if it is som et hing t he neural net is not able t o
discrim inat e t he classes [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ fh] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ df.%−−] : Because m ost of it is sil
m n052 [ s] : I m ean , we have dropped som e silence f We have dropped

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : No , we haven’t dropped silence fram es st ill .
m n007 [ s^ na] : Uh , st ill not .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n052 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : t he b b biggest classificat ion would be t he speech and
silence .

m n007 [ %−] : Th
m n052 [ s] : So , by having an addit ional , uh , feat ure which says " t his

m e018 [ qw.%−−] : What [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Do y do you hav e t hat feat ure available for t he t est

ev ery t hing [ disfm arker] all t he feat ures are com put ed .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , oh , I see .
m n052 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk^ r] : I see .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : so t he neural [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : so t hat is com ing from a separat e neural net or som e VAD
.
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ bk^ r] : OK .
m n052 [ s^ e.%−] : Which is [ disfm arker] which is cert ainly giving a
m e018 [ s^ bu] : So you ’re saying , feed t hat , also , int o [ pause] t he

m n052 [ %] : t o [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : Yeah . So it it ’s an [ disfm arker] addit ional discrim inat ing

m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n052 [ %−−] : So t hat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ cs] : You could feed it int o t he neural net .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : The ot her t hing [ com m ent ] you could do is just , um , p

, um , neural net , t andem neural net , [ com m ent ] based on t he fact
t hat y ou have a silence probabilit y .
m n052 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ df] : So you have an independent est im at or of what t he

m e013 [ s^ cs^ df] : and you could m ult iply t he t wo t hings , and

m e013 [ s] : Uh , I m ean , you ’d have t o do t he nonlinearit y part and

m n007 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s^ cs] : Uh , I m ean , go backwards from what t he nonlinearit y

m n052 [ s^ t 1] : Through [ disfm arker] t t o t he soft m ax .
m e013 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker] but , uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fg] : Yeah , so [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s.%−] : m ay be , yeah , when [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : But in principle wouldn’t it be bet t er t o feed it in ?

m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e018 [ qw^ cs] : So , what if you t hen , uh [ disfm arker] since you know

m e013 [ h] : Well , uh ,
m n007 [ s.%−] : That ’s what [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : Well , I guess t hat ’s t he sam e .

[ disfm arker] do y ou see m ore peaks or som et hing ?
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s^ na] : Yeah , for inst ance .
m e013 [ fg] : But I [ disfm arker] bu
m n007 [ s] : It [ disfm arker] it seem s t hat t he VAD net work doesn’t
[ disfm arker] Well , it doesn’t drop , uh , t oo m any fram es
m n007 [ s^ df] : because t he dele t he num ber of delet ion is reasonable

m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Now t he only problem is you don’t want t o t a I guess

m e013 [ s] : but cert ainly , it would be in parallel wit h t he [ disfm arker]
wit h a t andem net .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ e] : In t im e .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So m aybe , if t hat doesn’t work ,
m e013 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ cs] : But it would be int erest ing t o see if t hat was t he
problem , any way .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : And [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and t hen I guess
anot her alt ernat ive would be t o t ake t he feat ure t hat you ’re feeding
int o t he VAD , and feeding it int o t he ot her one as well .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : And t hen m aybe it would just learn [ disfm arker] learn it
bet t er .
m e013 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−−] : But t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ cs] : Yeah , t hat ’s an int erest ing t hing t o t ry t o see , if
what ’s going on is t hat in t he highly m ism at ched condit ion , it ’s , um ,
causing delet ions by having t his silence probabilit y up [ disfm arker] up
t oo high ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ e] : at som e point where t he VAD is saying it ’s act ually
speech .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fg] : So , m
m e013 [ s^ e] : Which is probably t rue .
m e013 [ %−−] : Cuz [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Well , t he V A
m e013 [ s.%−−] : if t he VAD said [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : since t he VAD is [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] is right a

m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Hm m .

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n007 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , and t he ot her t hing [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Well , t here are ot her issues m aybe for t he t andem ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : like , uh , well , do we want t o , w uh n Do we want t o

m n007 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : it was giv ing s slight ly bet t er result s .
m e013 [ s^ ng] : Problem is , if you are going t o run t his on different m
t est set s , including large vocabulary ,
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .

m n007 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
