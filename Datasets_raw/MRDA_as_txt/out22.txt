m e013 [ z] : Ty pically when you [ disfm arker] you ’re ab r st art ing around

m e013 [ z] : it st art s t o harden and t hen it ’s just harder for t he lens t o

fe016 [ z] : Oh .
m e013 [ z] : and t h t he [ disfm arker] t he sym pt om is t ypically t hat you

[ disfm arker] t o see it .
m n005 [ z] : Uh − huh .
m n005 [ z] : Yeah .
m e013 [ z] : In fact , uh m m y brot her ’s a [ pause] geront ological

fe016 [ z] : Give som eone a piece of paper and t hen t hey [ disfm arker]
Oh .
m n005 [ z] : Yeah .
m e013 [ z] : Yeah .
m e011 [ z] : We ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re live by t he way , so we ’ve got a

m n005 [ z] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ z] : You know .
m e011 [ s^ bu] : So . This t im e t he form discussion should be very short
,
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?

m e013 [ s^ e] : It also should be [ pause] lat er .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ df] : Because Jane uh is not here yet .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Good point .
m e013 [ s] : And uh she ’ll be m ost int erest ed in t hat .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , she ’s probably least involved in t he signal −
processing st uff
m e013 [ s.%−−] : so m aybe we can just [ disfm arker] just uh ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : I don’t t hink we should go t hough an elaborat e t hing ,
m e013 [ s] : but um uh Jose and I were just t alking about [ vocalsound]
t he uh [ nonvocalsound] uh , speech e energy t hing ,
m n005 [ s^ 2.%−−] : The @ @ [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and I uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : We didn’t t alk about t he derivat ives .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : But I t hink , you know , t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] i
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : if I can [ disfm arker] if you don’t m ind m y
[ disfm arker] m y speaking for y ou for a bit , um [ vocalsound] Uh .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Right now , t hat he ’s not really showing any kind of uh
dist inct ion , but uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : but we discussed a couple of t he possible t hings t hat
uh he can look at .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um . And uh one is t hat uh t his is all in log energy
m e013 [ s] : and log energy is basically com pressing t he dist ances
[ v ocalsound] uh [ pause] bet ween t hings .
m e013 [ s] : Um [ pause] Anot her is t hat he needs t o play wit h t he
[ disfm arker] t he different uh [ pause] uh t em poral sizes .
m e013 [ s] : He was [ disfm arker] he [ disfm arker] he was t aking
ev ery t hing over t wo hundred m illiseconds
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh , and uh he ’s going t o vary t hat num ber and also
look at m oving windows , as we discussed before .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um And uh [ disfm arker] and t he ot her t hing is t hat t he
[ disfm arker] yeah doing t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] subt ract ing off
t he m ean and t he variance in t he [ disfm arker] [ pause] uh and dividing
it by t he [ pause] st andard deviat ion in t he log dom ain , [ vocalsound]
m ay not be [ pause] t he right t hing t o do .
m n005 [ s^ t 3] : Hi .
m e011 [ s^ t 3] : Hi Jane !
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : We just st art ed .
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Could you t ake t hat m ike t here ?
fe016 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : Are t hese t he long t erm m eans ?
fe016 [ s^ e.%−−] : Like , over t he whole [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ qy ^ d] : I m ean , t he m eans of [ pause] what ?
m e013 [ s.%−] : Uh B Bet ween [ disfm arker] bet ween [ disfm arker]

fe016 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : All t he fram es in t he conversat ion ?
m e011 [ s^ ft ] : Thanks .
fe016 [ qrr^ d.%−−] : Or of t hings t hat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Bet ween [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ar] : Neit her .
m n005 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s uh bet ween t he pauses [ pause] uh for som e segm ent
.
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s] : And so i i his [ disfm arker] his [ disfm arker] He ’s m aking t he
const raint it has t o be at least t wo hundred m illiseconds .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s] : And so you t ake t hat .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen he ’s [ disfm arker] he ’s uh m easuring at t he
fram e lev el [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : st ill at t he fram e level , of what [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : and t hen [ disfm arker] and t hen just uh norm alizing wit h
t hat larger am ount .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : um and [ disfm arker] But one t hing he was point ing out
is when he [ disfm arker] he looked at a bunch of exam ples in log
dom ain , it is act ually pret t y hard t o see [ vocalsound] t he change .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : And you can sort of [ pause] see t hat , because of j of
just put t ing it on t he board t hat [ vocalsound] if you sort of have log − X
plus log − X , t hat ’s t he log of X plus t he log of t wo
m n005 [ b] : Yep .
fe016 [ fg|s^ cs] : Yeah , m aybe it ’s not log dist ribut ed .
m n005 [ b] : Mm m .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : and it ’s just , [ pause] you know , it [ disfm arker] it
dim inishes t he [ pause] effect of hav ing t wo of t hem .
m n005 [ x ] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
fe016 [ qy ] : But you could do like a C D F t here inst ead ?
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
fe016 [ s^ df.%−−] : I m ean , we don’t know t hat t he dist ribut ion here is
norm ally .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yes , right .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So [ disfm arker] So what I was suggest ing t o him is t hat
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ cs.%−] : So just som e kind of a sim ple [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bc] : Act ually , a PDF .
m e013 [ s] : But , y ou know , uh But , eit her way .
fe016 [ s^ bk^ m ] : PDF
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−] : Yeah , eit h eit h uh [ v ocalsound] B
fe016 [ s^ cs] : Som et hing like t hat where it ’s sort of dat a driven .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ arp.%−−] : Yeah , but I t hink [ pause] also u I t hink a
good first indicat or is when t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he
researcher looks at [ vocalsound] ex am ples of t he dat a and can not
see a change [ pause] in how big t he [ disfm arker] t he signal is ,
[ v ocalsound] when t he t wo speaker [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Then , t hat ’s a problem right t here .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : So . I t hink you should at least be able ,
fe016 [ b] : Oh yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs:s] : doing casual looking and can get t he sense , " Hey ,
t here ’s som et hing t here . "
m e013 [ s] : and t hen you can play around wit h t he m easures .
fe016 [ b] : Oh yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df] : And when he ’s looking in t he log dom ain he ’s not
really seeing it .
m e013 [ %−−] : So .
m e013 [ s^ df^ rt ] : And when he ’s looking in st raight energy he is ,
m e013 [ s] : so t hat ’s a good place t o st art .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s^ t c] : Um . So t hat was [ disfm arker] t hat was t he
discussion we just had .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um . [ vocalsound] The ot her t hing
m e013 [ s] : Act ually we ca had a quest ion for Adam in t his .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Uh , when you did t he [ v ocalsound] sam pling ? uh
[ pause] over t he [ pause] speech segm ent s or s or sam pling over t he
[ disfm arker] t he indiv idual channels in order t o do t he e uh t he

t he ent ire [ disfm arker] everyt hing in t he m ike channels ?
m n005 [ %−] : How [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy^ d] : You didn’t t ry t o find speech ?
m e011 [ s^ ar|s] : No , I just t ook over t he ent ire s uh ent ire channel
m e011 [ fh|s] : um [ pause] sam pled t en m inut es random ly .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right , OK .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So t hen t hat m eans t hat som eone who didn’t speak
[ pause] v ery m uch [ v ocalsound] would be largely represent ed by

m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And som eone who would [ disfm arker] who would be
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : So t he norm alizat ion fact or probably is [ pause] i i i
[ pause] is [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker]

m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah , t his was quit e quick and dirt y , and it was just for
[ pause] list ening .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ df] : And for list ening it seem s t o work really well .
m n005 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ df] : But , it ’s not [ disfm arker] Not a good m easure .
m e013 [ %−] : So t h
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ bs.%−−] : So yeah t here [ disfm arker] t here [ disfm arker]
t here [ disfm arker] There ’s a good chance t hen given t hat different

m n005 [ b] : Mm m .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yes , absolut ely .
m e013 [ s] : if [ disfm arker] if we can figure out a way t o do it .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s^ bs] : Uh . But we were agreed t hat in addit ion t o t hat
[ com m ent ] uh t here should be [ pause] s st uff relat ed t o pit ch and

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ t c] : So we didn’t t alk at all about uh t he ot her derivat ives ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : but uh again just [ disfm arker] just looking at
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Uh , I t hink uh Liz has a very good point , t hat in fact it
would be m uch m ore graphic just t o show [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Well , act ually , you do have som e dist ribut ions here , uh

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : um [ pause] and [ pause] uh , t hey don’t look very

m n005 [ s] : This is t he [ disfm arker] t he first derivat e of log of fram e

m e013 [ s.%−] : " Num ber " [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ cs] : m aybe we shouldn’t m ake any assum pt ions about t he

m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK . Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So she [ disfm arker] she ’s right .
m n005 [ s] : but it ’s t he [ disfm arker] it ’s t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t he following .
m e013 [ s.%−] : That ’s a [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ cs] : Well it m ight be just good t o know what it looks like .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−] : Cuz [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : That ’s [ disfm arker] That ’s uh [ pause] cuz I ’d m ent ioned

m n005 [ qw^ br] : Huh ?
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , even before you get t he scat t er plot s , just
looking at a single feat ure [ vocalsound] uh , looking at t he dist ribut ion
, is a good t hing t o do .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s] : Cat al − uh [ disfm arker] Com bining t he different possibilit ies

m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker] but what she ’s saying
[ pause] is , which is right , is [ pause] le
m n005 [ s.%−−] : com binat ion of t wo , [ pause] of energy and derivat e
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , let ’s st art wit h t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Before we get com plicat ed , let ’s st art wit h t he m ost basic

[ disfm arker] uh if y ou look at t he energy , t hat , when t wo people are

m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e013 [ s^ e] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat sort of hypot hesis .
m n005 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right .
m e013 [ s] : And t he first way y ou ’d look at t hat , uh s she ’s , you

m e013 [ s] : is t hat you would just t ake a look at t he dist ribut ion of

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : m uch as you ’ve plot t ed t hem here ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : You know , but just [ disfm arker] but just [ disfm arker]
[ pause] just uh do it [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Well in t his case you hav e t hree .
m e013 [ s] : You have t he silence , and t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s fine .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So , uh wit h t hree colors or t hree shades or what ever ,
m e013 [ s] : just [ disfm arker] just look at t hose dist ribut ions .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen , given t hat as a base , you can see if t hat get s

worsened [ pause] by t he [ disfm arker] looking at regular energy ,
looking at log energy ,
m e013 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : we were just proposing t hat m aybe it ’s [ disfm arker]
y ou know , it ’s harder t o [ pause] see wit h t he log energy ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|qh^ rt ] : um and uh also t hese different norm alizat ions ,
does a part icular choice of norm alizat ion m ake it bet t er ?
m e013 [ s] : But I had m aybe m ade it t oo com plicat ed by suggest ing
early on , t hat y ou look at scat t er plot s
m e013 [ s^ df] : because t hat ’s looking at a dist ribut ion in t wo

m e013 [ s^ co] : Let ’s st art off just in one , uh , wit h t his feat ure .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink t hat ’s probably t he m ost basic t hing , before

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : I agree , yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Uh − huh .

m e013 [ s] : Um [ pause] But [ pause] since [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
uh y our int uit ion from looking at som e of t he dat a , is t hat when you
looked at t he regular energy , t hat it did in fact usually go up ,
[ v ocalsound] when t wo people were t alking , [ vocalsound] t hat ’s
[ disfm arker] eh y ou know , you should be able t o com e up wit h a

m e013 [ fg|s.%−] : Yeah . So t here ’ll be som e cases for which
[ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s.%−] : Because t here reach very m any
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But , t he qu So [ disfm arker] So t hey ’ll be [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : This is [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] I w want t o point [ pause]
t o visual t hings ,
m e013 [ s] : But I m ean t hey [ disfm arker] t here ’ll be t im e [ disfm arker]
There ’ll be ov erlap bet ween t he dist ribut ions ,
m e013 [ s] : but t he quest ion is , " If it ’s a reasonable feat ure at all ,
t here ’s som e separat ion . "
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ e] : Especially locally .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

fe016 [ s.%−−] : So . Locally .
m n005 [ s^ aa^ m ] : just locally , y eah .
m e011 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] I was just going t o say t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat [ pause] right now we ’re just exploring .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : And t he ot her t hing is I
fe016 [ s^ fa] : Sorry .
fe016 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : What y ou would im agine event ually , is t hat you ’ll feed all
of t hese feat ures int o som e [ pause] discrim inat ive syst em .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : And so even if [ disfm arker] if one of t he feat ures does a
good job at one t y pe of overlap , anot her feat ure m ight do a good job
at anot her t ype of overlap .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s.%−] : Yeah , t his is t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s] : Right . I m ean t he [ disfm arker] t he reason I had
suggest ed t he scat t er f p feat ures is I used t o do t his a lot , when we
had t hirt een or fift een or t went y feat ures [ pause] t o look at .
m e013 [ s^ df] : um Because som et hing is a good feat ure uh by it self ,
y ou don’t really know how it ’ll behave in com binat ion
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and so it ’s nice t o have as m any [ disfm arker] as m any
t oget her at t he sam e t im e as possible in uh in som e reasonable visual
form .
m e013 [ s] : There ’s cool graphic t hings people have had som et im es
t o put t oget her t hree or four in som e funny [ disfm arker] funny way .
m e013 [ s] : But it ’s t rue t hat you shouldn’t do any of t hat unless you
know t hat t he indiv idual ones , at least , have [ disfm arker] have som e
uh [ disfm arker] som e hope
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : Well , especially for norm alizing .
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : I m ean , it ’s really im port ant t o [ pause] pick a
norm alizat ion t hat m at ches t he dist ribut ion for t hat feat ure .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : And it m ay not be t he sam e for all t he t ypes of overlaps or
t he windows m ay not be t he sam e .
fe016 [ s] : e Act ually , I was wondering , [ v ocalsound] right now you ’re
t aking a [ disfm arker] all of t he [ pause] speech , from t he whole
m eet ing , and you ’re t rying t o find point s of overlap ,
fe016 [ s] : but we don’t really know which speaker is overlapping wit h
which speaker ,
fe016 [ qy^ d^ g] : right ?
m e013 [ s^ aa^ m ] : Right .

m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : So I m ean anot her way would just be t o t ake t he speech
from just , say , Morgan , And just Jane and t hen just t heir overlaps ,
fe016 [ s] : like [ disfm arker] but by hand ,
fe016 [ s] : by cheat ing ,
fe016 [ s^ cs] : and looking at you know , if you can det ect som et hing
t hat way ,
fe016 [ s^ df] : because if we can’t do it t hat way , t here ’s no good way
t hat we ’re going t o be able t o do it .
m e011 [ s^ e] : No prayer .
fe016 [ s] : That [ disfm arker] You know , t here m ight be som et hing
helpful and cleaner about looking at just [ pause] individuals and t hen
t hat com binat ion alone .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : Plus , I t hink it has m ore elegant [ disfm arker] e
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : The m t he right m odel will be [ pause] easier t o see t hat way
.
fe016 [ s.%−−] : So if [ disfm arker] I don’t know , if you go t hrough and
y ou find Adam , cuz he has a lot of overlaps and som e ot her speaker
who also has e enough speech
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : and just sort of look at t hose t hree cases of Adam and
t he ot her person and t he overlaps ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ %−−] : m aybe [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : and just look at t he dist ribut ions , m aybe t here is a clear
pat t ern
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe016 [ s] : but we just can’t see it because t here ’s t oo m any
com binat ions of [ disfm arker] of people t hat can overlap .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : I had t he sam e int uit ion last [ disfm arker] last [ disfm arker]
last week .
fe016 [ fh] : So .
m n005 [ qy^ bh^ rt ] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : Just seem s sort of com plex .
fe008 [ s] : I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] t o st art wit h it ’s s your [ disfm arker]

[ pause] eh you know wit hout t he [ pause] ext ra [ pause] layers of

fe016 [ fg] : Right .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : Cuz if energy doesn’t m at t er t here , like [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : I don’t t hink t his is t rue , but what if

fe008 [ s^ cs] : Well , you [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker] you don’t have

fe016 [ s.%−−] : Well , t o st udy t he sim plest case t o get rid of ext ra
[ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s.%−] : The [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] But

fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : Cuz what if it ’s t he case and I don’t t hink t his is t rue
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ba] : That was a great ov erlap by t he way .
fe016 [ qh.%−−] : What if it ’s t he case t hat when t wo people overlap
t hey equat e t heir [ disfm arker] you know , t here ’s a [ pause]

fe016 [ qh] : bot h people t alk m ore soft ly ?
fe016 [ s^ bd] : I don’t t hink t his happens at all .

fe008 [ s] : t here ’s som e equalizing in t here ?

m e013 [ h|s^ ar] : Uh , no we don’t hav e t hat .
fe016 [ s^ rt .%−] : I m ean .
m e013 [ %−] : But .
m e011 [ s] : Well , but [ disfm arker] But I t hink t hat ’s what I was saying
about different t ypes of overlap .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ t 1] : Sat urat ion .
fe016 [ s] : There are [ disfm arker] t here are different t ypes ,
fe016 [ s.%−−] : and wit hin t hose t ypes ,

fe016 [ s:s] : m eaning t he kind t hat ’s [ pause] a friendly

fe016 [ s:s^ ba] : " Great ! " ,
fe016 [ s:s^ ba] : " Yeah ! "
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : And it doesn’t t ake [ disfm arker] you don’t t ake t he floor .
fe016 [ s] : Um , but , som e of t hose , as y ou showed , I t hink can be
discrim inat ed by t he durat ion of t he ov erlap .

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ fh] : So .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : It [ disfm arker] Act ually t he s new st udent , Don , who um
Adam has m et , and he was at one of our m eet ings [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : He ’s [ pause] get t ing his feet wet and t hen he ’ll be st art ing

fe016 [ s] : He ’s int erest ed in t rying t o dist inguish t he t ypes of overlap
.
fe016 [ s^ no] : I don’t know if he ’s t alked wit h you yet .
m n005 [ fg] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : But in sort of honing in on t hese different t ypes
m n005 [ s] : I don’t consi Now I don’t consider t hat possibilit y .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : and [ disfm arker] So m aybe [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s.%−−] : This is a s a general st udio of t he overlapping we ’re
st udy ing t he [ disfm arker] i
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : So it m ight be som et hing t hat we can [ pause] help by
cat egorizing som e of t hem and t hen , you know , look at t hat .
m e013 [ s] : Well [ pause] I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I
would s act ually st ill recom m end t hat he do t he overall t hing
m e013 [ s^ df] : because [ pause] it would be t he quickest t hing for him
t o do .
m e013 [ s] : He could [ disfm arker] You see , he already has all his st uff

fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : he has t he hist ogram m echanism ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : he has t he st uff t hat subt ract s out [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : and all he has t o do is change it uh uh from [ disfm arker]
from log t o plain energy and plot t he hist ogram and look at it .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : And t hen he should go on and do t he ot her st uff

fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−] : but [ disfm arker] But t his will [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fg|s^ ar] : Yeah , no . I didn’t m ean t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
[ disfm arker] for y ou t o do t hat ,
fe016 [ s^ cs] : but I was t hinking if [ disfm arker] if Don and I are t rying
t o get [ pause] cat egories
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : and we label som e dat a for you , and we say t his is what
we t hink is going [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : So you don’t have t o worry about it .
fe016 [ s] : And here ’s t he t hree t ypes of overlaps .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : And we ’ll [ disfm arker] we ’ll do t he labelling for you .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ b] : Hm − hm m .
fe016 [ %−] : Um .
m n005 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : Consider different class of overlap ?
fe016 [ s^ na] : Yeah , t hat we would be working on anyway .
m n005 [ s] : If t here ’s t im e .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs.%−−] : Then m aybe [ pause] you can t ry som e different

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s] : This is t he t hing I [ disfm arker] I com m ent wit h you before ,
t hat uh we hav e a great variat ion of t h sit uat ion of overlapping .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ s] : And t he behavior for energy is , uh log energy ,
[ v ocalsound] is not uh t he sam e all t he t im e .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But I guess I was just saying t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
right now uh from t he m eans t hat you gave , I don’t have any sense of

for which t here is dist inct [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : and I would im agine t here should be som e [ disfm arker]
y ou know , t here should be [ disfm arker] The dist ribut ions should be

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Uh and I [ disfm arker] I would st ill guess t hat if t hey are not

t here ’s m ost likely som et hing wrong in t he way t hat we ’re m easuring

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , but [ pause] um For inst ance , I m ean I wouldn’t
ex pect t hat it was very com m on overall , t hat when t wo people were

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : alt hough som et im es , as y ou say , it would .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ fg|s^ df.%−−] : Yeah , no , t hat was [ disfm arker] That was a jok
m e013 [ fh] : So . So .
fe016 [ s^ df] : or a sort of , a case where [ disfm arker] where you would
never know t hat unless you act ually go and look at t wo individuals .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean .
m e013 [ s^ bd^ rt ] : No .

m e013 [ s^ bd] : It could [ disfm arker] it probably does happen
som et im es .
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ qy ] : Mind if I t urned t hat light off ?
fe016 [ fg] : So .
m e011 [ s^ df] : The flickering is annoy ing m e .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s] : It m ight t he case , t hough , t hat t he significant energy , just
as Jose was say ing , com es in t he non − backchannel cases .
fe016 [ s^ df] : Because in back Most people when t hey ’re t alking don’t
change t heir own [ pause] energy when t hey get a backchannel ,
fe016 [ s^ df] : cuz t hey ’re not really predict ing t he backchannel .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : And som et im es it ’s a nod and som et im es it ’s an " m m −
hm m " .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : And t he " m m − hm m " is really usually very low energy .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : So m ay be t hose don’t act ually have m uch difference in
energy .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : But [ pause] all t he ot her cases m ight .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : and t he backchannels are sort of easy t o spot s in
t erm s of t heir words or [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : e [ v ocalsound] e and [ disfm arker] and again what t hey
[ disfm arker] what difference t here was would kind of be lost in t aking
t he log ,
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , just list en t o it .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fh] : so ,
fe016 [ s^ aap] : Well , it would be lost [ pause] no m at t er what you do .
m n005 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : as well .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : It just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ar^ rt ] : Mm m , no ,
m e013 [ s^ df.%−] : if it ’s [ disfm arker] if i if it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ %−] : Tone
m e013 [ s] : Well , it won’t be as big .
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , even if you t ake t he log , you can [ disfm arker] your

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .

m e011 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : Sure , but t one m ight be very
fe016 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , you ’re " m m − hm m " t one is going t o be very
different .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Right . Right .
m e011 [ s] : You could im agine doing specialized ones for different
t y pes of backchannels , if you could [ disfm arker] if you had a good
m odel for it .
m e011 [ s] : Your " m m − hm m " det ect or .
m e013 [ s^ t c] : If [ disfm arker] if you ’re [ disfm arker] a I guess m y point
is , if y ou ’re doing essent ially a linear separat ion , t aking t he log first
does in fact m ake it harder t o separat e .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] So , uh if you i i So i if t here
[ disfm arker] if t here close t o t hings it does
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : it ’s a nonlinear operat ion t hat does in fact change t he
dist inct ion .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : If you ’re doing a non if you ’re doing som e fancy t hing
t hen [ disfm arker] t hen
m e013 [ s] : yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And right now we ’re essent ially doing t his linear t hing by
looking across here and [ disfm arker] and saying we ’re going t o cut it
here .
m e013 [ s] : Um and t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he indicat or t hat we ’re
get t ing .
m e013 [ s] : But any way , yeah , we ’re not [ pause] disagreeing on any
of t his ,
m e013 [ s] : we should look at it m ore uh [ disfm arker] m ore finely , but
uh uh I t hink t hat [ disfm arker] This oft en happens , you do fairly
com plicat ed t hings , and t hen y ou st and back from t hem and you
realize t hat you haven’t done som et hing sim ple .
m e013 [ s] : So uh , if you generat ed som et hing like t hat just for t he

t hey g have uh uh sm aller um , m ore coherent groups t o look at , t hat
would be anot her int erest ing t hing lat er .
m n005 [ b] : Uh − huh .

coding t he t ypes of overlaps t hat people were involved in s just wit h
reference t o speaker st yle so , y ou know , wit h reference [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : That ’d be great .
fe008 [ s] : and you know I said t hat on m y [ disfm arker] in m y sum m ary ,
fe016 [ s.%−−] : Yeah , I rem em
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : t hat [ pause] you know so it ’s like people m ay have
different am ount s of being overlapped wit h or overlapping
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : but t hat in it self is not inform at ive wit hout knowing what
t y pes of overlaps t hey ’re involved in
fe008 [ s] : so I was planning t o do a t axonom y of t ypes overlaps wit h
reference t o t hat .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : That would be great .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ ba^ r] : That would be really great .
fe008 [ s] : So , but it you know it ’s like it sounds like you also have uh
som et hing in t hat direct ion .
m e011 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ qy.%−] : Is [ disfm arker] is it [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : We have not hing [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : You know , basically , we got [ pause] his environm ent set
up .
fe016 [ s^ df] : He ’s [ disfm arker] he ’s a double − E [ com m ent ] you
know .
fe016 [ s^ df^ rt ] : So . It ’s m ost ly t hat , [ pause] if we had t o [ pause]
label it ourselves , we [ disfm arker] we would or we ’d have t o , t o get
st art ed ,
fe016 [ s^ cs] : but if [ disfm arker] [ pause] It [ disfm arker] it would be
m uch bet t er if y ou can do it .
fe016 [ s] : You ’d be m uch bet t er [ com m ent ] at doing it also
fe016 [ s] : because [ v ocalsound] you know , I [ disfm arker] I ’m not
[ disfm arker] I don’t have a good feel for how t hey should be sort ed out
,

fe008 [ s^ ba^ t 1] : Int erest ing .
fe016 [ s] : and I really didn’t wanna go int o t hat if I didn’t have t o .
fe016 [ s.%−] : So if [ disfm arker] If you ’re w willing t o do t hat or
[ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ cs.%−] : Well m aybe we can
m e011 [ s] : It would be int erest ing , t hough , t o t alk , m aybe not at t he
m eet ing , but at som e ot her t im e about what are t he classes .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : I t hink t hat ’s a research [ pause] effort in and of it self ,
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Yeah , it would be int erest ing .
fe016 [ s] : because y ou can read t he lit erat ure , but I don’t know how
it ’ll [ pause] t urn out
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : and , You know , it ’s always an int erest ing quest ion .
m n005 [ s^ ba] : I would t hink it ’s int erest ing , yeah .
fe008 [ s] : It seem s like we also s wit h reference t o a purpose , t oo ,
t hat we we ’d want t o have t hem coded .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : That ’d be great .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : That ’d be really great .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s] : And we ’d st ill have som e [ pause] funding for t his project ,
fe008 [ s] : I can do t hat .
m n005 [ %−] : uh uh
fe016 [ s] : like probably , if we had t o hire som e [ disfm arker] like an
undergrad , because uh Don is being covered half t im e on som et hing
else [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , he [ disfm arker] we ’re not paying him [ pause] t he
full RA − ship for [ disfm arker] all t he t im e .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : So . [ v ocalsound] um If we got it t o where we want ed
[ disfm arker] we needed som eone t o do t hat [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : I don’t t hink t here ’s really enough dat a where
[ disfm arker] where [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : Yeah , I see t his as a prot ot ype , t o use t he only t he
[ disfm arker] t he already t ranscribed m eet ing as just a prot ot ype .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .

m n005 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink a a anot her param et er we c we
[ disfm arker] we can consider is eh t he [ pause] durat ion .
fe016 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ s] : Anot her e e m besides eh t he [ disfm arker] t he class of

m n005 [ s] : Because is possible [ v ocalsound] eh som e s s um eh som e

m n005 [ s] : eh , [ pause] a durat ion very short uh when we have
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] we have overlapping wit h speech .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ bk^ t 1] : Yeah , definit ely .
fe008 [ s] : Yeah , m aybe [ disfm arker] It m ay be correlat ed .
m n005 [ s.%−−] : Is possible t o hav e .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ s] : And it ’s int erest ing , [ pause] I t hink , [ pause] t o consider
t he [ disfm arker] t he window of norm alizat ion ,
m n005 [ s] : norm alizat ion window .
m n005 [ s^ df.%−−] : Eh [ pause] because eh if we have a t ype of ,
[ pause] a kind of eh overlap , eh backchannel overlap , wit h a short

m n005 [ s.%−−] : i i t hat if we norm alize eh wit h eh [ pause] eh consider
only t he [ disfm arker] t he eh window eh by t he left eh ri eh [ pause] side
on t he right side ov erlapping wit h a [ disfm arker] a very [ pause] eh oh
a sm all window
m n005 [ s] : eh t he [ disfm arker] if t he fit of norm alizat ion is eh m m m

fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , t hat ’s t rue .
fe016 [ s^ bs] : The window shouldn’t be larger t han t he backchannel .
m n005 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I m e I [ disfm arker] I underst and .
m n005 [ s] : I m ean t hat you have eh you have a backchannel , eh , eh
[ disfm arker] you hav e a overlapping zone very short
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s.%−−] : and you consider eh n eh all t he channel t o norm alize
t his v ery short eh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n005 [ s:s] : for exam ple " m m m m m − hm m hm m " eh
m n005 [ s] : And t he energy is not eh height
m n005 [ s^ rt ] : eh I t hink if you consider all t he channel t o norm alize
and t he channel is [ pause] m m m bigger [ pause] eh eh eh com pared
wit h t he [ disfm arker] wit h t he ov erlapping eh durat ion ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ s] : eh t he effect is m m m st ronger

m n005 [ s] : eh [ pause] t hat I [ disfm arker] I m ean t he [ disfm arker] t he

and t he variance eh is different t hat if you consider [ pause] only a

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ %−] : Not [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu] : You [ disfm arker] you want it around t he overlapping

m e013 [ s^ e] : You want it t o include som et hing t hat ’s not in

m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker] but uh
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know .
m n005 [ %−] : Is [ disfm arker] s If [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : Well it ’s a sliding window ,
fe016 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
fe016 [ s] : So if y ou t ake t he [ disfm arker] t he m easure in t he cent er of
t he ov erlapped [ pause] piece , you know , t here ’d bet t er be som e
som et hing .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : But if your window is really huge t hen yeah you ’re right
fe016 [ s.%−−] : y ou won’t even [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s] : Yeah , This is t he [ disfm arker] This is t he [ disfm arker] t he
idea , [ v ocalsound] t o consider only t he [ disfm arker] t he sm all window
near [ disfm arker] near [ disfm arker] near t he [ disfm arker] t he

fe016 [ s] : The port ion of t he [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] of t he

fe016 [ s.%−] : But y ou [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ fg] : So .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : You know , you shouldn’t be m ore t han
fe016 [ s] : like [ disfm arker] [ pause] You should definit ely not be t hree
t im es as big as your [ disfm arker] as your [ pause] backchannel .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : Then y ou ’re gonna w hav e a wash .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : And hopefully it ’s m ore like on t he order of [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ no] : I ’m not sure t hat ’s [ pause] necessarily t rue .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah ?

fe008 [ s] : It is an em pirical quest ion , it seem s like .
fe016 [ %−] : Yea
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Because [ disfm arker] because it [ disfm arker] because
um again if you ’re just com pensat ing for t he gain ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : y ou know , t he fact t hat t his [ disfm arker] t his gain t hing
was crude ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : and t he gain wh if som eone is speaking relat ively at
consist ent lev el , just t o [ disfm arker] t o give a [ disfm arker] an ext rem e
ex am ple , all y ou ’re doing is com pensat ing for t hat .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen you st ill s And t hen if you look at t he fram e wit h
respect t o t hat , it st ill should [ disfm arker] should uh change
fe016 [ fg|s] : Yeah , it depends how different your norm alizat ion is , as
y ou slide your window across .
fe016 [ s] : I m ean . That ’s som et hing we don’t know .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : It ’s possible t o t ry it bot h ways ,
m e011 [ s] : Well , I m ean we ’re also t alking about a couple of different
t hings .
fe008 [ qy ^ g] : isn’t it ?
fe008 [ s^ t 1.%−−] : in t his sm all
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , one is your analysis window and t hen t he ot her is
any sort of norm alizat ion t hat you ’re doing .
fe016 [ fg|s] : Yeah I was t alking about t he n norm alizat ion window .
m e011 [ s] : And t he [ disfm arker] And t hey could be quit e different .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : This was sort of where [ disfm arker] where we were last
week .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : That ’s t rue . Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e013 [ s^ co^ t ] : But , anyway We [ disfm arker] we ’ll have t o look at
som e core t hings .
fe016 [ fg] : Um .
m n005 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s^ ba.%−−] : But t hat ’d be great if [ disfm arker] if you ’re m arking
t hose
fe016 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] um .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Great .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .

fe016 [ s] : But it is definit ely t rue t hat we need t o have t he t im e m arks
,
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : and I was assum ing t hat will be inherit ed because , if you
have t he words and t hey ’re roughly aligned in t im e via forced
alignm ent or what ever we end up using , t hen you know , t his [ pause]
st udent and I would be looking at t he t im e m arks
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yep , I agree .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : and classifying all t he fram es inside t hose as what ever
labels Jane gave
fe008 [ s^ 2.%−] : Com ing off of t he ot her [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Good .
fe008 [ s] : So , it wouldn’t be [ pause] I wasn’t planning t o label t he
t im e m arks .
fe016 [ s] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n005 [ s^ cs] : I can give you m y t ranscript ion file ,
fe008 [ s^ df] : I was t hinking t hat t hat would com e from t he
engineering side ,
fe016 [ s^ no] : I don’t t hink you need t o .
m n005 [ qy ^ d^ g] : no ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
fe016 [ fg|s] : Yeah . That should be linked t o t he words which are
linked t o t im e som ehow ,
fe008 [ s^ aa] : There you go .
fe016 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e011 [ s] : Well we ’re not any t im e soon going t o get a forced

fe016 [ s^ aap] : Not now .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m n005 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Um If it ’s not hand − m arked t hen we ’re not going t o get
t he t im es .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : Well , it ’s som et hing t hat w
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : Well , we [ disfm arker] we wouldn’t be able t o do any work
wit hout a forced alignm ent anyway ,
m n005 [ %−] : Yes
fe016 [ s^ cs] : so som ehow if [ disfm arker] once he get s going we ’re
gonna haft a com e up wit h one
fe016 [ %−−] : and
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Good . Good .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean w I guess we could do a very bad one wit h
Broadcast News .

fe016 [ s] : So what ever you would label would be at t ached t o t he

fe008 [ b] : Great !
fe008 [ b] : Good , good .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : Well again for t he close [ pause] m ike st uff , we could com e
up [ disfm arker] t ake a s t ake t he Swit chboard syst em or som et hing ,
m e011 [ s^ ba] : That m ight be good enough .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] Um
m e011 [ s] : It ’d be wort h a t ry .
m e011 [ s] : It would be int erest ing t o see what we get .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : Just , you know , low − pass filt er t he speech and
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : Cuz t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s a lot of work you can’t do
wit hout t hat ,
fe016 [ qh.%−−] : I m ean , how [ disfm arker] how would you [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : You ’d hav e t o go in and m easure every st art and st op point
next t o a word
fe016 [ s] : is y if you ’re int erest ed in anyt hing t o do wit h words .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : It would be very inefficient .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ fh] : So .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ t c|s^ ba] : Anyway [ pause] So t hat ’d be great .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Good . OK .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ t ^ t c] : There ’s som et hing we should t alk about lat er
m e013 [ s] : but m ay be not just now .
m e013 [ s^ co] : But , uh , should t alk about our opt ions as far as t he
uh uh [ pause] t ranscript ion
m e013 [ s] : But . Well , w But we ’ll do t hat lat er .
m e011 [ s] : Yep , if IBM doesn’t [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ b] : Good .
fe016 [ qy .%−−] : Do we haft a [ pause] t urn [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ qy ^ rt ] : Are we supposed t o keep recording here ?
fe008 [ s^ bk|s^ cs] : Yeah . Let ’s do t hat lat er .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Yeah [ vocalsound] Right .
m e013 [ s^ cs^ m ] : We ’ll t alk about it lat er .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : So [ v ocalsound] uh Uh

m e013 [ s^ t ^ t c] : " form s " .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : You had som et hing on form s .
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : Form s Next it erat ion of form s .
m e011 [ s^ t 1] : Oops .
fe008 [ s^ fe] : Oh !
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Oh good , OK .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ b] : Oh .
fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : How [ disfm arker] So it ’s t wo pages per person ?
m e011 [ s^ ar] : Nope .
m e011 [ s] : One ’s a digit form ,
m e011 [ s] : one ’s a speaker form .
fe008 [ s^ bk^ fe^ rt ] : Oh !
m e011 [ s] : So one is a one t im e only [ pause] speaker form and t he
ot her is t he digit s .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see .
m n005 [ s^ rt ] : Oh it ’s t he sam e .
m n005 [ s^ t 1] : Oh no no .
m n005 [ s^ t 1] : Is [ disfm arker] is new Is OK .
m e011 [ s^ co] : So don’t fill t hese out .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Alright .
m e011 [ s^ df] : This is just t he suggest ion for uh what t he new form s
would look like .
m e011 [ s] : So , t hey incorporat e t he changes [ pause] t hat we t alked
about .
fe008 [ s^ t 1] : Dat e and t im e .
fe008 [ qw^ rt ] : Uh why did you swit ch t he order of t he Dat e and Tim e
fields ?
fe008 [ s^ bd.%−] : This is rat her a low − lev el , but
m e011 [ qw^ d] : On which one ?
fe008 [ s] : On [ disfm arker] on t he new one , Tim e com es first and t hen
Dat e ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : but I t hought [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Oh y ou m ean on t he digit form ?
fe008 [ s] : This is [ disfm arker] t his is rat her a low level quest ion , but
[ disfm arker] but it used [ disfm arker] used t o be Dat e cam e first .
m e011 [ s] : Uh , because t he user fills out t he first t hree fields and I fill
out t he rest .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh I see .
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : So it was int ent ional .
fe008 [ qw] : Well , how would t he [ disfm arker] How would t he user
know t he t im e if t hey didn’t know t he dat e ?
m e011 [ s^ ba^ rt ] : It ’s an int erest ing observat ion ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : but it was int ent ional .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : Because t he dat e is when you act ually read t he digit s
and t he t im e and ,

m e011 [ s^ fa] : excuse m e ,
m e011 [ s^ bsc] : t he t im e is when you act ually read t he digit s , but I ’m
filling out t he dat e beforehand .
m e011 [ s] : If you look at t he form in front of you ? t hat you ’re going t o
fill out when you read t he digit s ? you ’ll see I ’ve already filled in t he
dat e but not t he t im e .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−] : I always assum ed [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bu] : So t he t im e is supposed t o be pret t y exact ,
fe008 [ s] : because I ’ve just been t aking beginning t im e [ disfm arker]
t im e of t he m eet ing .
fe016 [ s^ na] : Yeah , m e t oo .
m n005 [ %−] : Yeah , I [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah , I ’ve not iced t hat in t he form s .
m n005 [ b] : yeah .
m e011 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he reason I put t he t im e in , is so t hat
t he person who ’s ext ract ing t he digit s , m eaning m e , will know where
t o look in t he m eet ing , t o t ry t o find t he digit s .
fe016 [ qy .%−] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n005 [ s^ aa^ m ] : Me t oo .
m n005 [ s^ bk] : Oh !
fe008 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Oh dear .
m n005 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] I am put [ disfm arker] I am put t ing t he

fe008 [ s^ rt ] : We ’ve been [ disfm arker] we ’ve been m essing up your

m e011 [ s^ aa] : I know .
fe016 [ qr.%−−] : So y ou should call it , like , " digit s st art t im e " . Or .
m e011 [ s] : And I hav en’t said any t hing .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m n005 [ s] : in [ disfm arker] on t here .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : Why [ disfm arker] What [ disfm arker] what were you
put t ing in ?
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : Oh , well , I was saying if we st art ed t he m eet ing at t wo
t hirt y ,
m n005 [ b^ rt ] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : I ’d put t wo t hirt y , and I guess d e everyone was put t ing t wo
t hirt y ,
m e013 [ b] : Oh .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−−:s.%−−] : and I didn’t realize t here was " uh oh I ’m about t o
read t his and I should " [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ar|s] : No , it ’s about fift y fift y .
m e011 [ s^ bsc] : Act ually it ’s about one t hird each .
m e011 [ s] : About one t hird of t hem are blank ,
m e011 [ s] : about one t hird of t hem are when t he digit s are read ,

m e011 [ s] : and about one t hird of t hem are when t he [ pause]

m n005 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e011 [ fh] : So .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : if you ’re a TI or MIT [ v ocalsound] from [ vocalsound]
ninet een eight y − five .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ qy^ rt ] : So I guess m y only quest ion was if [ disfm arker] if you

m e013 [ fg|s] : You know , I t hink if you ’re t alking [ disfm arker] if you ’re
t hinking in t erm s of places , [ pause] as opposed t o [ pause] nam es
different peop nam es people hav e given t o [ pause] different ways of

would be m ore com m on t han say ing Midland ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : I m ean , I [ disfm arker] I went t o s
fe016 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : Yeah . Now [ pause] t he usage [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : Maybe we can giv e t hem a li [ pause] like a lit t le m ap
?
fe016 [ s.%−−] : wit h t he regions and t hey just [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ df] : No , I ’m serious .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : No , t hat ’s not bad .

fe016 [ s^ df^ rt ] : Because it t akes less t im e , and it ’s sort of cut e
m n005 [ s^ bu^ ng] : i at t his [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] in t hat side
[ disfm arker] in t hat side of t he [ disfm arker] t he paper .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : t here ’s no figure .
m e013 [ %−] : Well .
fe016 [ s^ df.%−−] : Well just a lit t le [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : You know , it doesn’t have all t he det ail ,
fe016 [ s.%−−] : but y ou sort of [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw^ ng.%−−] : But what if you m oved five t im es and [ disfm arker]
and uh
fe008 [ s^ cs.%−−] : Well , I was t hinking you could have m a m ult iple ones
and t hen t he am ount of t im e [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ ar|s] : No , but you ’re cat egorized .
fe016 [ s.%−] : That ’s t he sam e [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : so , roughly .
fe008 [ s^ e] : So . You could say , [ pause] you know " t en years
[ pause] on t he east coast , five y ears on t he west coast " or
som et hing or ot her .
m e011 [ s^ nd] : Well , We [ disfm arker] I t hink we don’t want t o get t hat

m e011 [ s^ rt ] : I t hink t hat ’s alright if we want t o follow up .
m e011 [ %−−] : But .
m e013 [ s^ no] : I guess we don’t really know .
fe016 [ s^ na] : I m ean I [ disfm arker] As I said , I don’t t hink t here ’s a
huge [ pause] benefit t o t his region t hing .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : It [ disfm arker] it get s [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : The problem is t hat for som e t hings it ’s really clear and
usually list ening t o [ com m ent ] it you can t ell right away if it ’s a New

fe016 [ s.%−−] : but New York and Bost on are t wo [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : well , I guess t hey hav e t he NYC ,
fe016 [ s] : but New England has a bunch of very different dialect s
fe016 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : and [ pause] so does um S So do ot her places .
m e011 [ s^ df] : Yeah , so I picked t hese regions cuz we had t alked
about TIMIT ,
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ e] : and t hose are right from TIMIT .
fe016 [ s] : And so t hese would be [ pause] sat isfying like a speech
[ pause] research [ pause] com m unit y if we released t he dat abase ,
m e011 [ fh] : So .
fe016 [ s] : but as t o whet her subject s know where t hey ’re from , I ’m
not sure because um I know t hat t hey had t o fill t his out for

fe016 [ s] : This is i alm ost exact ly t he sam e as Swit chboard regions
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh . OK .
fe016 [ s] : or very close .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ fh|s] : Um And I don’t know how t hey filled t hat out .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : But t h if Midland [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : Yeah , Midland is t he one t hat ’s difficult I guess .
fe008 [ s.%−] : I t hink a lot of people [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : Also Nort hwest you ’ve got Oreg − Washingt on and Oregon
now which uh y people don’t know if it ’s west ern or nort hern .

m e011 [ s^ 2] : Nort hwest ?
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ %−−] : But [ disfm arker]

m e011 [ s^ no] : I don’t know what t o do about it .
fe008 [ s^ no] : I wouldn’t know how t o charact erize m ine eit her .

pane wit h t he one v iew , It has m ult iple panes [ pause] wit h t he views .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : But t he problem wit h it is t he drawing of t hose waveform s
is so slow t hat ev ery t im e you do anyt hing it just crawls .
fe008 [ b.x] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : It ’s really bad .
fe016 [ s^ bu.%−] : It ’s [ disfm arker] So , it [ disfm arker] it ’s t he
redrawing of t he w
fe008 [ s^ t 1] : That ’s a considerat ion .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : oh uh − huh ,
fe016 [ s^ bu] : w as you m ove .
m e011 [ s] : As y ou play , as you m ove , as you scroll .
m e011 [ s^ df] : Just about anyt hing , and it [ disfm arker] it was so slow
it was not usable .
fe008 [ s] : And t his ’ll be a [ disfm arker] hav having t he m ult iwave will
be a big help
m e011 [ s] : So t hat ’s why I didn’t inst all it and didn’t pursue it .
fe008 [ s^ df] : cuz [ disfm arker] in t erm s of like disent angling overlaps
and t hings , t hat ’ll be a big help .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Oh yeah .
m e011 [ fg|s] : So . I t hink t hat t he one Dan has is usable enough .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .

m e011 [ s] : It doesn’t display t he ot hers .
m e011 [ s] : It displays just t he m ixed signal .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : But y ou can list en t o any of t hem .
fe008 [ fg] : That ’s excellent .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : He also has version cont rol which is anot her nice
fe008 [ s.%−] : e so y ou [ disfm arker] e t he pat ches t hat you
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ar|s] : No , he suggest ed t hat , but he didn’t [ disfm arker]
[ pause] It ’s not inst alled .
fe008 [ s^ df] : Oh , I t hought it was in one of t hose pat ches .
m e011 [ s^ ar] : No . No .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh OK .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Well . Alright .
fe016 [ qy ^ rt ] : So is t here any hope for act ually display ing t he wave
form ?
m e011 [ s^ nd] : Um , not if we ’re going t o use Tcl − TK At least not if we
’re going t o use Snack .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ e] : I m ean you would have t o do som et hing ourselves .
fe008 [ s^ aap] : Well , or use t he one t hat crawls .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s] : Well , I ’m [ disfm arker] I probably would be t rying t o use t he
[ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] what ever ’s t here .
fe016 [ s.%−] : And it ’s useful t o have t he [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ cs.%−−] : Why don’t we [ disfm arker] we see how Dan ’s works
and if it [ disfm arker] If we really need t he display [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : I m ean . I wonder [ disfm arker] I ’m just wondering if we can
display t hings ot her t han t he wave form .
fe016 [ s] : So . Suppose we have a feat ure [ disfm arker] a feat ure
st ream .
fe016 [ s] : And it ’s just , you know , a [ disfm arker] a uni − dim ensional
feat ure , v ary ing in t im e .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : And we want t o plot t hat , inst ead of t he whole wave form .
m e011 [ %−] : I m ean .
m n005 [ b.%] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : That m ight be fast er .
fe016 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ g] : Right ?
m n005 [ b.%] : Yeah .
fe016 [ %−] : So .
m e011 [ s^ aap] : We [ disfm arker] we could do t hat but t hat would
m ean changing t he code .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean t his isn’t a program we wrot e .

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : This is a program t hat we got from som eone else , and we
’v e done pat ches on .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s^ cc] : OK . Well , I ’ll t alk t o you about it and we can see
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−] : Cou − i e I m ean , y
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : but it ’s definit ely [ pause] great t o have t he ot her one .
fe016 [ %−] : That ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu^ cs^ rt ] : If t here was som e [ disfm arker] Is t here som e
way t o [ pause] have som eone writ e pat ches in som et hing fast er and
[ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] link it in , or som et hing ?
m e013 [ qrr.%−] : Or is t hat [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ar] : Not easily .
m e011 [ s^ aap^ df] : I m ean y yes we could do t hat .
m e011 [ s] : You could [ disfm arker] y ou can writ e widget s in C .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : And t ry t o do it t hat way but I just don’t t hink
[ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ cs] : Let ’s t ry it wit h Dan ’s and if t hat isn’t enough , we can
do it ot herwise .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s|s^ df] : I t hink it is , cuz when I was playing wit h it , t he m ixed
signal has it all in t here .
m e011 [ s] : And so it ’s really [ disfm arker] It ’s not t oo bad t o find
places in t he [ disfm arker] in t he st ream where t hings are happening .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And it ’s also [ disfm arker] also t he case t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat uh t his m ult i − wave t hing [ pause] is proposed t o t he
[ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b.%] : Hm m ?
m e011 [ s] : So I [ disfm arker] I don’t t hink it ’ll be bad .
fe008 [ s] : So . Dan proposed it t o t he Transcriber cent ral people ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : and it ’s likely t hat uh [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : So . And [ disfm arker] and t hey responded favorably
fe008 [ s] : looks as t hough it will be incorporat ed in t he fut ure version
.
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
fe008 [ s] : They said t hat t he only reason t hey hadn’t had t he m ult i t he
parallel uh st ream one before was sim ply t hat [ pause] t hey hadn’t had
t im e t o do it .
fe008 [ fh|s] : And uh [ pause] so it ’s likely t hat t his [ disfm arker] t his
m ay be ent ered int o t he ch t his cent ral @ @ .

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : They m ay well hav e not had m uch dem and for it .
m e011 [ %−] : And if [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Well t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t rue
, t oo .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : This is a [ disfm arker] [ pause] a useful t hing for us .
fe016 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So . You m ean t hey could [ disfm arker] t hey
could do it and it would be [ pause] fast enough if t hey do it ?
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ar|s.%−−] : Oh . No . I just m ean [ disfm arker] I just m ean t hat
it ’s [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat his [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Depends on how m uch work t hey did .
fe016 [ qrr.%−−] : Or [ disfm arker] ?
m n005 [ b.x] : Oh .
fe008 [ s] : So . [ pause] This one t hat we now have does have t he
st at us of [ pause] pot ent ially being incorporat ed l likely being
incorporat ed int o t he cent ral code .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Now , t ha Now , if we dev elop furt her t hen , y uh , I don’t
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I m ean it ’s [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s a nice feat ure t o have it
[ disfm arker] set t hat way .
m e011 [ s] : I t hink if [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] if one of us sat down
and coded it , so t hat it could be display ed fast enough I ’m sure t hey
would be quit e willing t o incorporat e it .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : But it ’s not a t rivial t ask .
fe016 [ s] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m . Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ df] : I just like t he idea of it being som et hing t hat ’s , you
know , t ied back int o t he original , so t hat ot her people can benefit
from it .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : However . I also underst and t hat you can have [ pause]
widget s t hat are very useful for t heir purpose and t hat you don’t need
t o alway s go t hat w rout e .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : OK .
m e011 [ fg|qy ^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : anyway , shall we do digit s ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ co^ rt ] : Yeah . Let ’s do digit s ,
m e013 [ s^ co] : uh , and t hen we ’ll t urn off t he m ikes , and t hen I have
one ot her t hing t o discuss .

fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s] : I act ually have t o leave .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s] : So . Um . I m ean [ pause] I had t o leave at t hree t hirt y ,
fe016 [ s] : so I can [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] Well , I can wait [ pause]
for t he digit s but I can’t st ay for t he discussion
fe008 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Uh − oh .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ qr.%−−] : Well , you want t o go first ? Or .
fe016 [ s^ df] : I c [ pause] I hav e t o m ake a call .
fe016 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ t 3.%−−] : Well , we ’ll t alk t o you about it [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] Uh
fe008 [ qy^ cs^ rt .%−−] : Well , should we [ disfm arker] e should we swit ch
off t he g
fe016 [ fh] : Um .
m e011 [ qr] : Do y ou wanna go do digit s or do you wanna just skip
digit s ?
fe016 [ s] : No , I can do digit s if [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] But I don’t
wanna but t in , or som et hing .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ co^ t ] : Then [ disfm arker] Alright . You go ahead .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : But if t here ’s som et hing on t he rest of t he [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’ll be around just have t o m ake call before
quart er of .
fe016 [ fh] : So .
m n005 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : So I [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ cs] : Or we can t alk about it .
fe008 [ fh] : Ke
m e011 [ qh^ co] : Why don’t you read t he digit s ?
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK . [ v ocalsound] Alright .
m e013 [ s^ co^ m ^ na] : Yeah , why don’t you read t he digit s and t hen
y ou can [ pause] go .
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : Oh , t his is t he new one .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ co] : Yeah , don’t [ disfm arker] Don’t read t he old one .
fe016 [ b] : Alright .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : The [ disfm arker] And t he t im e is .
fe016 [ b] : OK .
