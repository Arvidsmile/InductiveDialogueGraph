m e011 [ s] : OK , we ’re on .
m e011 [ s^ t ] : So , I t hink t his is gonna be a pret t y short m eet ing
because I have four agenda it em s ,
m e011 [ s] : t hree of t hem were request ed by Jane who is not gonna be
at t he m eet ing t oday .
m e011 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e011 [ h|s^ rt ^ t ] : So . [ vocalsound] The uh first was t ranscript ion
st at us .
m e011 [ qy^ rt ] : Does anyone besides Jane know what t he
t ranscript ion st at us is ?
m e018 [ fg|s] : Um , sort of , I do , peripherally .
m e018 [ h|s] : Um [ disfm arker] Well first of all wit h IBM I got a not e from
Brian y est erday say ing t hat t hey finally m ade t he t ape for t he t hing
t hat we sent t hem a [ pause] week or week and a half ago
m n014 [ qy ^ rt ^ t 1] : Is t hat English ?
m n017 [ s] : That ’s our syst em .
m e011 [ s^ fe] : Ugh !
m e018 [ s] : and t hat it ’s gone out t o t he t ranscribers
m e018 [ s] : and hopefully next week we ’ll have t he t ranscript ion back
from t hat .
m e018 [ h|s] : Um [ disfm arker] Jane seem s t o be um m oving right along
on t he t ranscript ions from t he ICSI side .
m e011 [ qy] : C can I have a pen ?
m e018 [ s] : She ’s assigned , I t hink probably five or six m m ore
m eet ings .
m n014 [ s^ e] : Yeah , I t hink we ’re up t o MR t hirt een or som et hing .
m e018 [ fg|s] : Yeah , so um , I guess she ’s hired som e new
t ranscribers
m n017 [ b] : Mm m .
m e018 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ qw^ rt ] : Which m eet ings is she t ranscribing ?
m n017 [ s^ t 1.%−] : Speaking [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ h|s] : Um well we ’ve [ disfm arker] we ’ve run out of E D Us
because a cert ain num ber of t hem are um , sort of await ing t o go t o
IBM .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n014 [ s^ 2] : For IBM , yeah .
m e001 [ b] : OK .
m n017 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ s] : and t he rest are in process being t ranscribed uh here .
m e001 [ s^ bu] : So we ’re doing som e in parallel .
m n017 [ qy ^ rt ] : So does she have t ranscribers right now who are
basically sit t ing idle because t here ’s no dat a back from IBM
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e018 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e018 [ s^ ar^ r] : Oh no no .

m e011 [ s^ ar] : No , no .
m e018 [ s^ ar^ r] : No .
m n017 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ r^ rt ] : no ?
m e018 [ s] : We ’re not wait ing on t hem .
m e011 [ s] : We haven’t done t hat process .
m e011 [ s^ e] : So . They ’ r t hey ’re doing t he full t ranscript ion process
.
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e001 [ s^ bu.%−] : So t hey ’re just doing t heir own t hing unt il
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : Because I [ disfm arker] I need t o ask Jane whet her it ’s
[ disfm arker] it would be OK for her [ disfm arker] um , s som e of her
people t o t ranscribe uh som e of t he init ial dat a we got from t he
Sm art Kom dat a collect ion , which is t hese short like fiv e or seven
m inut e sessions .
m e018 [ s^ na] : We ’re doing it in parallel , yeah .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n014 [ b] : Yep .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : Um and we want it [ disfm arker] You know , we need
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] Again , we [ disfm arker] we have a sim ilar
uh logist ic set − up where we are supposed t o send t he dat a t o Munich
m n017 [ s] : and get it t ranscribed and get it back .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ s] : But t o get going we would like som e of t he dat a
t ranscribed right away so we can get st art ed .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Yep , sounds fam iliar .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : And so um I want ed t o ask Jane if [ disfm arker] if uh ,
y ou know , m aybe one of t heir t ranscribers could [ disfm arker] could do
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−] : I m ean since t hese are very short , t hat should really be
uh ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ %−] : um [ disfm arker] It ’s [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s] : There ’s only t wo channels .
m n014 [ %−] : So it ’s only [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s.%−] : It ’s only t wo [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s] : As t he synt hesis doesn’t have t o be t ranscribed I t hink .
m n017 [ fg] : Right , s
m n014 [ fh] : So .
m n017 [ fg] : Yeah .

m n017 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] So it ’s basically one channel t o t ranscribe
.
m n017 [ s.%−−] : And it ’s [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−] : One session is only uh like seven [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So t hat should have m a m any fewer [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ e] : And it ’s also not uh a bunch of int errupt ions wit h
people and all t hat ,
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n017 [ s] : And som e of it is read speech , so we could give t hem t he
[ disfm arker] t he t hing t hat t hey ’re reading
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s.%−] : and t hey just m ay [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ 2^ d^ rt ] : Make sure it ’s right .
m n017 [ fh] : And so um ,
m n014 [ b] : Yep .
m n017 [ fh|s.%−−] : um , I guess since she ’s [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−] : I was gonna ask her but since she ’s not around I
[ disfm arker] m ay be I ’ll [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s.%−] : Yeah , well it cert ainly seem s [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ cc] : Uh if [ disfm arker] if t hat ’s OK wit h you t o [ disfm arker]
t o , y ou know , get t hat st uff uh [ disfm arker] t o ask her for t hat , t hen I
’ll do t hat .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Yeah , if we ’re held up on t his ot her st uff a lit t le bit in
order t o encom pass t hat , t hat ’s OK because I I um , I m ean I st ill have
high hopes t hat t he t hat t he IBM pipeline ’ll work out for us , so it ’s
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK , yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Alright y .
m e018 [ fg|s^ t c] : Oh , yeah , and also relat ed t o t he t ranscript ion st uff
,
m e018 [ s] : so I ’v e been t rying t o keep a web page uh up t o dat e f
showing what t he current st at us is of t he t rans of all t he t hings we ’ve
collect ed
m e018 [ s.%−] : and what st age each m eet ing is in , in t erm s of whet her
it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy^ rt ] : Can you m ail t hat out t o t he list ?
m e018 [ s^ aa^ cc] : Mm − hm m , yeah I will .
m e018 [ %−−] : I [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : That ’s t he t hing t hat I sent out just t o foo people saying
can you updat e t hese pages
m e018 [ s.%−−] : and so t hat ’s where I ’m put t ing it but I ’ll [ disfm arker]

m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK , OK .
m e018 [ s^ cc] : I ’ll send it out t o t he list t elling people t o look at it .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , I haven’t done t hat .
m e011 [ s] : So . I have lot s of st uff t o add t hat ’s just in m y own
direct ory .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ cc] : I ’ll t ry t o get t o t hat .
m e011 [ s^ bk^ rt ^ t c] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : So Jane also want ed t o t alk about part icipant approval ,
but I don’t really t hink t here ’s m uch t o t alk about .
m e011 [ s^ cc] : I ’m just gonna do it .
m e011 [ s] : And uh , if anyone object s t oo m uch t hen t hey can do it
inst ead .
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d.%−] : You are going t o [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ cc] : I ’m gonna send out t o t he part icipant s , uh , wit h links
t o web pages which cont ain t he t ranscript s and allow t hem t o [ pause]
suggest edit s .
m e011 [ s] : And t hen bleep t hem out .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : For t he ones t hat we have .
m e011 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So but it ’s just t ranscript s , not t he
[ disfm arker] not t he audio ?
m e011 [ s^ ar|s] : Nope , t hey ’ll have access t o t he audio also .
m n014 [ s^ bk] : OK , yeah , yep .
m n014 [ h] : Ah .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean t hat ’s m y int ent ion .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Because t he t ranscript s m ight not be right .
m e018 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So y ou want people t o be able t o list en t o t hem .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : So , um t he audio t hat t hey ’re gonna have access
t o , will t hat be t he uncom pressed version ?
m e018 [ qrr.%−] : Or will you have script s t hat like uncom press t he
v arious pieces and [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Oh , t hat ’s a good point .
m e011 [ s^ ba^ r] : That ’s a good point .
m e011 [ h|s] : Yeah , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s probably going t o have t o be
t he uncom pressed versions because , uh , uh , it t akes t oo long t o do
random access decom pression .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ s.%−] : Yeah , I was just wondering because we ’re uh running
out of t he un − backed − up disk space on
m e011 [ s] : Well , t hat was t he ot her point .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu] : Oh , was t hat anot her one ?

m e011 [ s^ t ] : Yep , t hat ’s anot her agenda it em .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ cc] : I ’ll wait .
m e011 [ h] : So , uh [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ba] : But t hat is a good point so we ’ll get t o t hat , t oo .
m e011 [ h|s] : Um , DARPA dem o st at us , not m uch t o say .
m e011 [ s] : The back − end st uff is working out fine .
m e011 [ s] : It ’s m ore or less ready t o go .
m e011 [ s] : I ’ve added som e st uff t hat uh indes indexes by t he
m eet ing t ype MR , EDU , et cet era
m e011 [ s] : and also by t he user ID .
m e011 [ s] : So t hat t he front − end can t hen do filt ering based on t hat
as well .
m e011 [ fh|s] : Uh [ disfm arker] The back − end is uh , going m ore slowly
as I s I t hink I said before just cuz I ’m not m uch of a Tcl − TK
program m er .
m e011 [ fh|s] : And uh Dave Gelbart say s he ’s a lit t le t oo busy .
m e011 [ s] : So I t hink Don and I are gonna work on t hat and
[ disfm arker] and you and I can just t alk about it off − line m ore .
m e001 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ fh|s] : But uh [ pause] t he back − end was pret t y sm oot h .
m e013 [ fg] : Oh
m e011 [ s] : So I t hink , we ’ll have som et hing .
m e011 [ s] : It m ay not be as [ disfm arker] As pret t y as we m ight like ,
but we ’ll hav e som et hing .
m e013 [ s] : I wondered whe when we would reach Dave ’s sat urat ion
point .
m e013 [ s] : He ’s sort of been [ disfm arker] been volunt eering for
ev ery t hing
m e013 [ %−−] : and [ pause] and uh [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ fe^ rt ] : O K .
m e013 [ s] : Finally said he was t oo busy .
m e013 [ s] : I guess we reached it .
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah , he [ disfm arker] he act ually [ disfm arker] he
v olunt eered but t hen he s t hen he ret ract ed it .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ s^ bd] : Oh well .
m e011 [ fg] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ fg|s^ t c] : And , also um , I was just showing Andreas , I got um
an X Waves kind of display ,
m e001 [ s^ no] : and I don’t know how m uch m ore we can do wit h it
[ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s] : wit h like t he prosodic st uff where we have like st ylized
pit ches and signals and t he t ranscript s on t he bot t om

m e011 [ s^ ba] : Oh , cool .
m e001 [ s] : so , right now it ’s just an X Waves
m e001 [ s] : and t hen you have t hree windows
m e001 [ s] : but I don’t know , it looked pret t y nice
m e001 [ s] : and I ’m sure it [ disfm arker] t hink it has pot ent ial for a lit t le
som et hing ,
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : For a dem o ?
m e001 [ s^ aa^ r] : yeah , for a dem o .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , sounds good .
m e001 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s] : OK , so again , t he issue is [ disfm arker] For July , t he
issue ’s gonna be what can we fit int o a Windows m achine , uh , and so
on ,
m e001 [ b] : Oh .
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : So it m ight just be slides .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , OK .
m e001 [ s.%−] : Well , we ’ll see , um [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Well [ disfm arker] [ pause] Yeah .
m n014 [ s] : I ’ve been put t ing t oget her uh Transcriber t hings for
Windows
m n014 [ %−−] : so i
m n014 [ s] : And I inst alled it on Dave Gelbart ’s PC and it worked just
fine .
m n014 [ s] : So hopefully t hat will work .
m n017 [ qy^ bh] : Really ?
m n017 [ qy^ rt .%−−] : So is t hat [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−−] : Because t here ’s som e people um [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ cs] : It would be cool if we could uh get t hat t o work uh at
[ disfm arker] at SRI
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ df.%−−] : because t he um [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : we have m m We have m ore Windows m achines t o run
t he [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Well Transcriber is Tcl − TK , very generic wit h Snack ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : so basically anyt hing y ou can get Snack t o run on , it will
work .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m n014 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n014 [ fg] : Yeah
m n014 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] But t he problem is t he version Transcriber
works wit h , t he Snack version , is one point six what ever
m n014 [ s] : and t hat ’s not any m ore support ed .

m n014 [ s] : It ’s not on [ disfm arker] on t he web page anym ore .
m n014 [ s] : But I just wrot e an em ail t o [ disfm arker] t o t he aut hor of
[ disfm arker] t o t he Snack aut hor
m n014 [ s] : and he sent m e t o one point six what ever library
m n014 [ s] : and so it works .
m e011 [ s^ bu] : Well I t hought it was packaged wit h Transcriber ?
m n014 [ s^ aap] : Yeah ,
m n014 [ s^ arp] : but t hen you can’t add our pat ches
m n014 [ s] : and t hen t he [ disfm arker] t he new version is [ disfm arker]
is t ot ally different
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n014 [ s] : a and in [ disfm arker] yeah , in t erm s of [ disfm arker] of t he
source code .
m n014 [ s] : You [ disfm arker] you can’t find t he Tcl files anym ore .
m e011 [ b] : Ah .
m n014 [ s] : It ’s som e what ever wrapped t hing
m n017 [ b.%] : Mm m .
m n014 [ s^ e] : and y ou can’t [ disfm arker] you can’t access t hat
m n014 [ s] : so you have t o inst all [ disfm arker] First inst all Tcl t hen
inst all Snack
m n014 [ s] : and t hen inst all t he Transcriber t hing
m n014 [ s] : and t hen do t he pat ches .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Pat ch .
m n017 [ s^ cs.%−] : I [ disfm arker] I wonder if [ disfm arker] if we should
cont ribut e our changes back t o t he aut hors so t hat t hey m aint ain
t hose changes along [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ fe] : Ugh !
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : We have [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ qy^ bu^ d^ m ^ rt ] : We hav e ?
m e011 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah b it ’s just hasn’t m ade it int o t he release yet .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e018 [ qr^ t c.%−−] : So did you um put t he uh [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] t he NT version out on t he uh Meet ing Recorder page ? Or
[ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ ar] : No , I haven’t done t hat yet .
m n014 [ %−−] : I ’m [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ ar] : oh Nope .
m n014 [ s^ cc] : But I definit ely will do t hat .
m e013 [ qy ^ t c] : So , can som e of t he st uff t hat Don ’s t alking about
som ehow fit int o t his
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : Uh , m ean y ou just have a set of num bers t hat are
associat ed wit h t he [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ b] : Yeah .

m e001 [ s] : Yeah , it ’s basically ASCII files or binary files , what ever
represent at ion .
m n014 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s.%−−] : Just t hree different [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s.%−−] : It ’s a waveform and just a st ylized pit ch vect or basically
so it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s] : I m ean we could do it in Mat l − [ com m ent ] I m ean you could
do it in a num ber of different places I ’m sure .
m n017 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker] So [ disfm arker] Well [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ cs] : But [ disfm arker] But it would be cool if t he Transcriber
int erface had like anot her window for t he [ disfm arker] you know ,
m ay be abov e t he waveform where it would show som e arbit rary valued
funct ion t hat is [ disfm arker] t hat is y ou know t im e synchron t i t i t im e
sy nchronous wit h t he wavform .
m n014 [ b] : Yep .
m e001 [ b] : Yeah .
m e001 [ s^ aa^ ba] : Yeah , t hat ’d be very cool .
m e013 [ b] : Yes .
m e011 [ s] : It ’d be easy enough t o add t hat .
m e011 [ s^ ng] : Again it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ pause] It ’s m ore Tcl − T
m e001 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So som eone who ’s fam iliar wit h Tcl − TK has t o do it ,
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : but uh , it wouldn’t be hard t o do .
m n017 [ s] : But it would alm ost be like having anot her waveform
display ed .
m e001 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m n017 [ %−] : S
m n014 [ b] : Yep .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ cs] : Yeah , m aybe we could l look int o t hat .
m e001 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : But it [ disfm arker] it seem s t o m e t hat I c
m n014 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : It doesn’t seem like having t hat real t im e is t hat necessary
.
m e011 [ s] : So yo It seem s t o m e you could do im ages .
m e001 [ h|qw] : Um [ pause] What do you m ean by real t im e ?
m e001 [ qy .%−] : Do y ou m ean like [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : Like being able t o scroll t hrough it and st uff for t he
dem o .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Is t hat what y ou m ean ?

m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , jus Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : It just seem s t o m e jus
m e001 [ s.x ] : It would be cool t o see it [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s] : It would be cool like t o see [ disfm arker] t o hear it and see
it ,
m n014 [ s^ 2] : And t o hear it .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e001 [ s] : and see t he pit ch cont ours also .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aap|s^ nd] : Sure , but I don’t t hink [ disfm arker] I
[ disfm arker] You can do all t hat just st at ically in
m e001 [ s.%−] : I t hink it would lose [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s.%−] : Yeah , I m ean y
m e011 [ s.%−] : Just record t he audio clip and show an im age and I
t hink t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ fg] : Right , right .
m e001 [ s^ df] : I just t hought if you m eant slides I t hought you m eant
like just [ pause] like [ pause] um v iew graphs or som et hing .
m e013 [ %−−] : You know , wh
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : So . Uh ,
m e013 [ s] : no , we ’re t alking about on t he com put er
m e001 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ fg|s] : and [ disfm arker] and um , I t hink when we were t alking
about t his before we had lit t l t his lit t le dem o m eet ing ,
m e013 [ s] : we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness
t hat y ou could hav e
m e013 [ s] : and , [ vocalsound] t he m ore live , t he bet t er , but uh ,
giv en t he crunch of t im e , we m ay have t o ret reat from it t o som e

m e013 [ s] : So I t hink [ disfm arker] [ pause] For a lot of reasons , I t hink
it would be v ery nice t o have t his Transcriber int erface be able t o show
som e ot her int erest ing signal along wit h it
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : so it ’d be a good t hing t o get in t here .
m e013 [ fh] : But ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : um [ disfm arker] Anyway , jus just looking for ways t hat
we could act ually show what you ’re doing , uh , in [ disfm arker] [ pause]
t o people .
m e001 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : Cuz a lot of t his st uff , part icularly for Com m unicat or , uh
cert ainly a significant chunk of t he t hings t hat we waved our arm s
about t h originally had t had t o do wit h prosodics

m e013 [ s] : It ’d be nice t o show t hat we can act ually get t hem and
see t hem .
m e001 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ b] : Mm m .
m e011 [ s^ t c] : And t he last i it em on t he agenda is disk issues yet
again .
m e011 [ s] : So , we ’re doing OK on backed up .
m e011 [ s] : We ’re [ disfm arker] We ’re only about t hirt y percent on t he
second disk .
m e011 [ s] : So , uh , we have a lit t le bit of t im e before t hat becom es
crit ical ,
m e011 [ s] : but we are like ninet y five percent , ninet y eight percent on
t he scrat ch disks for t he expanded m eet ings .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : And , m y original int ent ion was like we would just delet e
t hem as we needed m ore space ,
m e011 [ s] : but unfort unat ely we ’re in t he posit ion where we have t o
deal wit h all t he m eet ing dat a [ pause] all at once , in a lot of different
way s .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : Oh t here ’s a lot of t ranscribers , t oo .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ m ] : Yeah , t here ’re a lot of t ranscribers ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : so all of t hose need t o be expanded ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ rt ^ t ] : and t hen people are doing chunking and I want t o do
uh , uh , uh , t he perm ission form s ,
m n014 [ %−] : An
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : so I want t hose t o be live , so t here ’s a lot of dat a t hat

m e011 [ fh|s] : Um [ disfm arker] And Jane was gonna t alk t o , uh , Dave
Johnson about it .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : One of t he t hings I was t hinking is we [ disfm arker] we
just got t hese hundred [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ fa] : alright , excuse m e [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : t en , uh SPARC − Blade SUN − Blades .

m e011 [ s^ r] : They cam e in but t hey ’re not set up yet .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : And so it seem s t o m e we could hang scrat ch disk on
t hose [ pause] because t hey ’ll be in t he m achine room ,

m e011 [ s^ e] : t hey ’ll be on t he fast connect ion t o t he rest of t he
m achines .
m e011 [ s] : And if we just need un − backed − up space , we could just
hang disks off t hem .
m e018 [ qy.%−−] : Well , is t here [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw^ cs^ nd] : Why not just hang t hem off of Abbot t ,
m e018 [ qy .%−] : is t here a [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Because t here ’s no m ore room in t he disk racks on Abbot t
.
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Ah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Ah , I see .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu.%−−] : Weren’t we gonna get [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Well , m aybe it should get anot her rack .
m n017 [ s] : But you st ill need t o st ore t he disks som ehow .
m e011 [ s] : Well , but t he SUN − Blades have spare drive bays .
m n017 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ cs.%−−] : You can put t wo [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ co] : Just put t hem in .
m n017 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt .%−] : Oh y ou m ean y ou put t hem inside t he pizza

m e011 [ s] : So you can just go out and buy a PC hard drive and st ick it
in .
m n017 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : But if Abbot t is going t o be our disk server it
[ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] file server [ com m ent ] it seem s like we

m n014 [ s.%−] : So .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh OK .
m e011 [ s.%−] : but we ’ll definit ely t ake it up if you [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ %−] : I t h
m n017 [ s^ na] : I t hink you ’re right .
m e001 [ s] : I t hink it ’s about four or five gig
m n017 [ s.%−] : It ’s XH and D [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s] : cuz I hav e four m eet ings on t here ,
m n017 [ %−] : The b
m n017 [ s] : I ’m also using DG

m n017 [ s] : I got t hat confused .
m e001 [ s] : t hree or four m eet ings .
m n017 [ s] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ ba^ t c] : Great .
m e001 [ s.%−−] : So .
m e013 [ s.%−] : We need [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ t c] : OK , so t hat will get us t hrough t he next couple day s .
m e013 [ s^ cs^ j] : We need anot her gigaquad .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e011 [ s^ e] : At least .
m e013 [ s] : There should [ disfm arker] I d There should just be a b I
should hav e a but t on .
m e013 [ s] : Just press [ disfm arker] Press each m eet ing saying " we
need m ore disk space " [ vocalsound] " t his week " .
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : The " m ore disk space " but t on ?
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ s^ co] : Skip t he rest of t he conversat ion .
m e018 [ s] : Well we ’ve collect ed so far som et hing like uh sixt y − five
m eet ings .
m e018 [ s] : And it ’s about a gig uncom pressed .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : And [ disfm arker] And how m uch does each m eet ing
t ake ?
m n014 [ s^ bc] : It ’s [ disfm arker] It ’s a lit t le bit m ore as I usually don’t
[ disfm arker] do not uncom press t he [ disfm arker] all of t he PZM and
t he PDA t hings .
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ m ^ rt ] : Is a lit t le m ore ?
m e018 [ s^ bk|s] : Right , yeah so if you uncom pressed everyt hing it ’s
ev en m ore .
m n014 [ %−] : So .
m n014 [ %−] : It ’s [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s] : One point five or som et hing .
m e018 [ qw] : U Uh com pressed how m uch are t hey ?
m e018 [ %−] : Like [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Half a gig .
m e018 [ qy^ bh^ d^ rt ] : About half ?
m e011 [ s] : For all of t hem .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yep .
m e018 [ s] : So we ’re definit ely are st oring you know , all of t hose .
m e018 [ qw^ t 1] : So t here ’s what
m e018 [ qy ^ bs] : t hirt y som e gig of just m eet ings so far ?
m e013 [ s] : So − so So m aybe t here ’s a hundred [ pause] gig or
som et hing .
m e013 [ fh.%] : Or [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean . Cuz we [ disfm arker] we have t he uncom pressed
around also .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−] : So it ’s like [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s] : Well we [ disfm arker] We haven’t uncom pressed all t he
m eet ings ,
m e018 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : I would like t o .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Well I m ean it ’s [ disfm arker] t he t hey really are cheap .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean it ’s just a quest ion of figuring out where t hey
should be and hanging t hem ,
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ s] : but But uh , we could [ disfm arker] You know , if you want
t o get four disks , get four disks .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s sm all [ disfm arker] I m ean
t hese t hings ar are just a few hundred dollars .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : Well I sent t hat m essage out t o , I guess , you and Dave
asking for [ disfm arker] if we could get som e disk .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : I s I sent t his out a [ disfm arker] a day ago
m e011 [ qw] : And put it where ?
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] and Dave didn’t respond so I don I don’t
know how t he whole process works .
m e018 [ qy.%−−] : I m ean does he just go out and get t hem and
[ disfm arker] if it ’s OK , and [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e018 [ s] : So I was assum ing he was gonna t ake over [ pause] t hat .
m e018 [ s] : But he ’s probably t oo busy given t hat he ’s leaving .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Yeah , I t hink y ou need a direct conversat ion wit h him .
m e013 [ s^ cs:qw] : And just [ vocalsound] say an − e just ask him t hat ,
y ou know , wha what should you do .
m e013 [ s:qy ] : And in m y answer back was " are you sure you just want
one ? "
m e013 [ s] : So I m ean I t hink [ pause] t hat what you want t o do is plan
ahead a lit t le bit and figure " well , here ’s what we pi figure on doing
for t he next few m ont hs " .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Wa − a I know what t hey want .

m e011 [ s] : The sy sadm ins would prefer t o have one ext ernal drive per
m achine .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So t hey don’t want t o st ack up ext ernal drives .
m e011 [ fh|s] : Um [ disfm arker] [ pause] And t hen t hey want ev eryt hing
else in t he m achine room .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ qw] : So t he quest ion is where are you gonna hang t hem ?
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : I don’t know what t he space sit uat ion is in t he m achine
room .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ %−] : So .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : So t his is a quest ion t hat ’s pret t y hard t o solve wit hout
t alking t o Dave ,
m n017 [ %−] : Th − The [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : I t hink part of t he reason why Dave can’t get t he
[ disfm arker] t he new m achines up is because he doesn’t have room in
t he m achine room right now .
m e013 [ s^ df.%−] : cuz it [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ %−] : One [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ %] : Mm m .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : One [ disfm arker] One On − One t hing t o in t o um t t o do
when y ou need t o conserve space is
m e018 [ s] : So he has t o re − arrange a bunch of st uff .
m n017 [ s] : I bet t here are st ill som e old , uh , like , nine gig disks , uh
, around
m n017 [ s] : and you can probably consolidat e t hem ont o larger disks
m n017 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and y ou know recover t he space .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : No .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink Dave [ disfm arker] Dave knows all t hese t hings , of
course .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : An − and so , he always has a a lot of plans of t hings t hat
he ’s gonna do t o m ake t hings bet t er in m any ways an and runs out of
t im e .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : But I [ disfm arker] I know t hat [ pause] generally t heir first
priorit y has been for backed up disk .
m e011 [ s] : And so I t hink what he ’s been concent rat ing on is uh t he
back [ disfm arker] t he [ pause] back up syst em , rat her t han on new
disk .

m n017 [ b] : Mm m .
m n017 [ b] : Mm m .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fg] : Well .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So .
m e011 [ %−] : Which [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : But t his [ disfm arker] t his is a very specific quest ion for m e
.
m e013 [ s] : Basically , we can easily get [ pause] one t o four disks ,
m e013 [ s] : I m ean you just go out and get four and we ’ve got t he
m oney for it ,
m e013 [ s] : it ’s no big deal .
m e013 [ fh|qo] : Uh , but t he quest ion is where t hey go ,
m e013 [ s] : and I don’t t hink we can solve t hat here ,
m n017 [ s^ cs] : May be we can put som e disks in t he [ disfm arker] in
t hat back room t here .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : y ou just have t o ask him .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah really .
m e013 [ s.%−] : At t ach t o [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Popcorn .
m n017 [ s^ 2^ rt ] : To t he m achine t hat collect s t he dat a .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah ?
m n017 [ s^ rt ] : So t hen you could , at least t em porarily , st ore st uff
t here .
m n017 [ %−] : The only [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b.%] : Hm m .
m e011 [ s^ arp] : Yeah , it ’s just [ disfm arker] It ’s not on t he net , so it
’s a lit t le [ pause] awkward
m n017 [ qw^ bu] : What do you m ean it ’s not on t he net ?
m e011 [ s.%−−] : It ’s not [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s] : It ’s not bad .
m e011 [ s] : It ’s behind lot s of fire walls t hat don’t allow any services
t hrough except S S
m n017 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Oh because it ’s [ disfm arker] because it ’s an
ACIRI m achine ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh , oh oh .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : And also on t he list is t o get it int o t he norm al ICSI net ,
m e011 [ qh] : but Who knows when t hat will happen ?
m e018 [ s] : That m ight be a good short t erm solut ion , t hough .
m n017 [ s] : But t hat can’t be t hat hard .
m n017 [ fh] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : No , t he [ disfm arker] t he problem wit h t hat apparent ly is
t hat t hey don’t current ly have a wire running t o t hat back room
[ pause] t hat goes anywhere near one of t he ICSI rout ers .

m n017 [ %−] : Oh ,
m e011 [ s] : So , t hey act ually have t o run a wire som ewhere .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah , e again , you know , any one of t hese t hings is
cert ainly not a big deal .
m e013 [ s.%−] : If t here was a person dedicat ed t o doing it t hey would
happen pret t y easily but it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] jus every
ev er ev erybody [ disfm arker] everybody has a [ disfm arker] has
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ arp] : But Dave has t o do all of t hem .
m e013 [ s^ nd] : Well all of us have long list s of different t hings we ’re
doing .
m e013 [ s] : But at any rat e I t hink t hat t here ’s a [ disfm arker] t here ’s
a longer t erm t hing and t here ’s im m ediat e need
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : and I t hink we need a [ disfm arker] a conversat ion
wit h [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s^ cs.x] : Uh , m aybe [ disfm arker] m aybe aft er [ disfm arker]
aft er t ea or som et hing you and I can go down and [ disfm arker] and
t alk t o him about it
m e013 [ s] : Just say " wha you know , what should we do right now ? "
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : How long is David gonna be gone ?
m e013 [ h|s^ rt ] : Uh , eleven days or som et hing ?
m e011 [ s^ fe] : Oh m y !

m n017 [ s] : Because you know I [ disfm arker] Fridays I have t o leave uh
like around uh t wo .
m n017 [ s^ cs.%−] : So if it could be before t hat would be be
m e013 [ s^ nd] : No , no but I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I don’t need
ot her folks for t he m eet ing .
m e013 [ s] : I can do it .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK , alright .
m e013 [ s.%−] : A A All I ’m saying is t hat on [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ fa] : Oh I ’m sorry , I m isunderst ood .
m n017 [ s.%−] : I t hought you are [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah
m e013 [ s] : so what I m eant was on t he m e t his m eet ing [ pause] if I wa
som et hing I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I ’m m aking a m ajor t hing in t he

m n017 [ fg|s^ t c] : Um [ disfm arker] Uh [ disfm arker] One t hing
[ disfm arker] I m ean [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
[ v ocalsound] in past m eet ings we had um also a you know various
[ disfm arker] variously t alked about t he um work t hat w uh was
happening sort of on t he [ disfm arker] on t he recognit ion side
m n017 [ fh|s] : um but isn’t necessarily relat ed t o m eet ings uh
specifically .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s^ cs] : So . Um . And I wondered whet her we should m aybe
have um a separat e m eet ing

m n017 [ s] : and bet ween you know , whoever ’s int erest ed in t hat
m n017 [ s^ df] : because I feel t hat uh t here ’s plent y of st uff t o t alk
about
m n017 [ s.%−−] : but it would be sort of um m aybe t he wrong place t o do
it in t his m eet ing if uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ bh] : Think so ?
m n017 [ s] : Well , it ’s t hat [ disfm arker] It ’s just gonna be ver very
boring for people who are not you know , sort of really int erest ed in
t he det ails of t he recognit ion syst em .
m e011 [ s^ nd] : I ’m int erest ed .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Me t oo .
m e013 [ fg|qw] : Well , OK , so how m any [ disfm arker] how m any people
here would not be int erest ed in uh [ disfm arker] in a m eet ing about
recognit ion ?
m e018 [ s] : Jane m ay not be .
m e011 [ s] : Jane , I t hink .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : Well I know [ disfm arker] Well , Jane an
m n014 [ b] : Yep .
m n017 [ qr.%−−] : Well you m ean in a separat e m eet ing or ha ha t alking
about it in t his [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e011 [ s] : If we t alked about it in t his m eet ing .
m e018 [ s] : He ’s wondering how m uch overlap t here will be .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ fg|%−] : Yeah , so you ’re su
m e013 [ %−] : So .
m n017 [ fg] : So ,

m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , I would as [ com m ent ] I would guess .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh . Um .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah

m n017 [ s^ cs] : And we don’t have t o do it every week .
m e018 [ qy .%−] : Could we [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ cs] : We could do it every ot her week or so .
m e018 [ s^ aa|%−] : Right , I was [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−] : You know , what ev or whenever we feel like we
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw^ cs^ rt ] : Why don’t we alt ernat e t his m eet ing every ot her
week ?
m e011 [ s^ 2^ cs^ ng] : Or just alt ernat e t he focus .
m e018 [ s] : Tha − That ’s what I m ean .
m e011 [ s^ e] : Yeah , so on even weeks have [ pause] basic [ pause] on
dat a .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ na] : We could do t hat , yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] Personally I ’d [ disfm arker] I ’m
not in favor of m ore m eet ings .
m n017 [ fh|s.%−] : Um . [ vocalsound] Because , uh .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ %−] : You know .
m e011 [ s^ j^ nd] : I am .
m e011 [ s^ fa.%−] : Oh sor

m e018 [ s] : But I do I don’t [ disfm arker] I m ean a lot of t im es lat ely it
seem s like we don’t really have enough for a full m eet ing on Meet ing
Recorder .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s.%−] : So if we did t hat [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Well , except t hat we keep going for our full t im e .
m n014 [ b] : Yep .
m e018 [ fg|s^ ng] : Well , cuz we get int o t hese ot her t opics .
m e001 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : We feel [ disfm arker] We feel obligat ed t o collect m ore dat a
.
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ x ] : Yeah .
m e011 [ x] : Ugh .
m e018 [ s^ cs.%−] : So if we could alt ernat e t he focus of t he m eet ing
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ar] : I don’t .
m e011 [ s^ co^ t 1] : Let ’s read digit s and go .
m e013 [ qw^ cs] : Why don’t we just st art wit h t hat .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : um m h . [ com m ent ] um m h . [ com m ent ] OK .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : And t hen if we find , you know we ’re just not get t ing
enough done , t here ’s all t hese t opics not com ing up , t hen we can
ex pand int o anot her m eet ing .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : But I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat ’s a great idea .
m e013 [ fh|s^ cs.%−−] : Uh . So uh . Um . Let ’s chat about it wit h Liz and
Jane [ pause] when we get a chance , see what t hey t hink and
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ fg|s] : Yeah t hat would be good .
m e018 [ s] : I m ean Andreas and I have various t alks in t he halls
m e018 [ s] : and t here ’s lot s of t hings , you know , det ails and st uff
t hat would I t hink people ’d be int erest ed in
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : and I ’d [ disfm arker] you know , where do we go from
here kind of t hings and [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ r^ rt ] : So , it would be good .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Yeah , and you ’re [ disfm arker] you ’re at t ending
[ pause] t he uh [ disfm arker] t he front − end m eet ing as well as t he
ot hers so you hav e [ disfm arker] y ou have probably one of t he best
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : you and I , I guess are t he m ain ones who sort of see t he
bridge bet ween t he t wo .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Bridge .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : We are doing recognit ion in bot h of t hem .

m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m n017 [ fg] : So um .
m e011 [ b] : OK ?
m n017 [ s^ cs^ t c] : So [ disfm arker] so we could t alk a lit t le bit about
t hat now if [ disfm arker] if t here ’s som e t im e .
m e011 [ s^ ar] : No , no t hat would be for next week .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : Um I jus So t he lat est result was t hat um
m n017 [ fh|s] : um yot I t est ed t he uh [ disfm arker] t he sort of final
v ersion of t he PLP configurat ion um on developm ent t est dat a for
[ disfm arker] for t his y ear ’s Hub − five t est set .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s] : And t he recognit ion perform ance was exact ly , and I m ean
ex act ly up t o t he [ disfm arker] you know , t he first decim al , sam e as
wit h t he uh Mel Cepst ra front − end .
m e011 [ b.%] : Mm m .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : For bot h fem ales and m ales ?
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m e018 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Oh !
m n017 [ s^ bd.%−−] : Uh , well i t here was a lit t le bit of a [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : i ov erall .
m n017 [ s] : They [ disfm arker] They were [ disfm arker] The m ales I t hink
were slight ly bet t er and t he fem ales were slight ly worse but not hing
really .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s] : I m ean definit ely not significant .
m e013 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s] : And t hen t he really nice t hing was t hat if [ disfm arker] if we
com bine t he t wo syst em s we get a one and a half percent
im provem ent .
m e011 [ b] : Wow .
m n017 [ %−] : So .
m e011 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : Just wit h ROVER ?
m n017 [ %−] : t
m n017 [ s] : Wit h N − best ROVER , which is like our [ vocalsound] new
and im proved version of ROVER .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s] : Which u act ually uses t he whole N − best list from bot h
sy st em s [ pause] t o [ pause] m m m , uh [ pause] c com bine t hat .
m e013 [ s] : So except [ disfm arker] I m ean t he only key difference
bet ween t he t wo really is t he kind of sm oot hing at t he end which is t he
aut o − regressive versus t he cepst ral t runcat ion .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ b] : OK .
m n017 [ %−] : And , t he [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : But a percent and a half ?
m e018 [ %−] : That ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Yeah , it ’s pret t y [ pause] im pressive .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : And [ disfm arker] And so uh aft er I t old t he [ disfm arker]
m y uh colleagues at SRI about t hat , you know , now t hey definit ely
want t o , you know , uh , have a [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : Nex t t im e we have an evaluat ion t hey want t o do uh , you
know , basically a at least t he syst em com binat ion .
m n017 [ fh|qh] : Um , and , you know , why not ?
m e013 [ s^ aa|qh^ m ] : Sure , why not ?
m n017 [ fh] : Uh . [ vocalsound] So .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : We clearly got t a add a few m ore feat ures , t hough .
m n017 [ h|qw^ bu] : Uh w what do y ou m ean ?
m n017 [ qr] : More feat ures in t he sense of front − end feat ures or in
t he sense of just bells and whist les ?
m e011 [ s] : No , uh front − end feat ures .
m e011 [ s] : You know we did PLP and Mel Cepst ra .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : Let ’s , you know , t ry RASTA and MSG , and
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−] : Oh I m ean [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ fg] : Well
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : So , we cou
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he t he
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−−] : There ’s one t hing uh [ disfm arker] I m ean you don’t
want t o ov erdo it because y every front − end [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : You know , if you [ disfm arker] you know you basically
m ult iply y our effort by N , where N is a num ber of different syst em s
m e018 [ b.%] : Oh .
m e013 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] Um .
m n017 [ s] : So . So one [ disfm arker] one com prom ise would be t o
[ disfm arker] only t o have t he [ disfm arker] everyt hing up t o t he point
where y ou generat e lat t ices be basically one syst em
m n017 [ s] : and t hen aft er t hat y ou rescore your lat t ices wit h t he
m ult iple syst em s
m n017 [ s] : and com bine t he result s and t hat ’s a fairly painless um
t hing .
m e013 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ %−] : An

m e018 [ qy ^ rt .%−−] : Do you t hink we ’d st ill get t he one and a half uh
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fh] : So .
m n017 [ s^ aa] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink so .
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : May be a lit t le less because at t hat point t he error rat es
are lower
m n017 [ s.%−−] : and so if [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s] : You know , m aybe it ’s only one percent or som et hing but
t hat would st ill be wort hwhile doing .
m n017 [ fh] : So .
m n017 [ s] : Um [ pause] Jus − You know , just want ed t o let you know
t hat t hat ’s working out very nicely .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Cool .
m n017 [ s^ t c.%−−] : And t hen we had som e result s on [ pause] digit s ,
uh , wit h um [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ %−−] : We [ disfm arker] We [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : So t his was uh really [ com m ent ] [ disfm arker] really sort of
just t o get Dave going wit h his um experim ent s .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : And so , uh .
m n017 [ s] : But as a result , um , you know , we were sort of wondering
why is t he Hub − fiv e syst em doing so well on t he digit s .
m n017 [ s] : And t he reason is basically t here ’s a whole bunch of read
speech dat a in t he Hub − five t raining set .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : Including digit s I gat her , yeah .
m n017 [ s.%−] : And you c
m n017 [ s.%−] : And [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−−] : Not all of [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ nd] : No it ’s act ually , digit s is only a m aybe a fift h of it .
m n017 [ s] : The rest is [ disfm arker] is read [ disfm arker] is read TIMIT
dat a and uh ATIS dat a and Wall St reet Journal and st uff like t hat .
m e013 [ qw] : A fift h of it is how m uch ?
m e013 [ fg] : Right .
m e013 [ qw^ r] : But a fi a fift h is how m uch ?
m n017 [ s] : A fift h would be m ay be uh t wo hours som et hing .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah , so I m ean t hat ’s act ually not t hat different from t he
[ pause] am ount of t raining t hat t here was .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ s] : But it definit ely helps t o have t he ot her read dat a in t here
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : because we ’re doing [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ bh^ d] : Oh yeah

m e013 [ %−] : w
m n017 [ s] : You know t he error rat e is half of what you do if you t rain
only on t i uh TIMIT [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] uh not TIMIT uh TI − digit s ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ qw] : which is only what
m n017 [ qy^ bu^ rt ] : t wo hours som et hing ?
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m n017 [ s] : So . Uh , m ore read speech dat a definit ely helps .
m n017 [ s] : And y ou can leave out all t he conversat ional dat a wit h no
perform ance penalt y .
m n017 [ %−] : That ’s e
m e013 [ s] : Yeah t hat was t he int erest ing t hing .
m n017 [ %−] : That was e
m e013 [ s] : Because [ disfm arker] because uh , it was apparent if you
put in a bunch m ore dat a it would be bet t er ,
m n017 [ b] : Right , right .
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker] but uh .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Well is t here ev en m ore read speech dat a around ?
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh , yeah .
m n017 [ s^ na] : So we only [ disfm arker] for t he Hub − five t raining , we
’re only using uh a fairly sm all subset of t he Macrophone [ pause]
dat abase .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ fh|s^ cs] : Um , so , you could beef t hat up and probably do
ev en bet t er .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : I could also put in [ pause] uh focus condit ion zero from
Hub − four from Broadcast News , which is m ost ly prepared speech .
m e018 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : It ’s not exact ly read speech but it ’s pret t y darn close .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ s] : Well , I m ean t hat ’s plent y of read speech dat a .
m n017 [ s] : I m ean , Wall St reet Journal , [ pause] uh , t ake one
ex am ple .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : That ’s right .
m n017 [ %−−] : But um .
m n017 [ s] : So , y ou know t hat m ight be useful for t he people who
t rain t he [ disfm arker] t he digit recognizers t o [ disfm arker] t o use uh
som et hing ot her t han TI − digit s .
m e011 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Well t hey been using TIMIT .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : That [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Uh . [ pause] They [ disfm arker] t hey uh [ disfm arker] t hey
ex perim ent ed for a while wit h a bunch of different dat abases wit h
French and Spanish and so fort h cuz t hey ’re m ult ilingual t est s
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and uh , um , [ disfm arker] and act ually
t he best result s t hey got wa were uh using TIMIT .
m e011 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s] : Uh [ disfm arker] But uh [ disfm arker] which [ disfm arker] So
t hat ’s what t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re using now .
m n017 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But [ disfm arker] but yeah cert ainly if we , um
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : If we knew what t he st ruct ure of what we ’re doing t here
was .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean t here ’s st ill a bunch of m essing around wit h
different kinds of uh noise robust ness algorit hm s .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So we don’t know exact ly which com binat ion we ’re gonna
be going wit h .
m e013 [ s] : Once we know , t hen [ disfm arker] t he t rainable part s of it
[ disfm arker] it ’d be great t o run lot s of [ disfm arker] lot s of st uff
t hrough .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ s^ t c] : Well , t hat was t hat .
m n017 [ s^ t c] : And t hen I t h guess Chuck and I had som e discussions
about how t o proceed wit h t he t andem uh syst em
m n017 [ qy ^ cs^ d] : and [ disfm arker] You wanna [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] You wanna see where t hat st ands ?
m e018 [ s.%−] : Well , I ’m [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : Yeah , so Andreas uh brought over t he uh alignm ent s t hat
t he SRI syst em uses .
m n017 [ b.%] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e018 [ s] : And so I ’m in t he process of um convert ing t hose
alignm ent s int o uh label files t hat we can use t o t rain uh a new net
wit h .
m e018 [ s] : And uh so t hen I ’ll t rain t he net .
m e018 [ s.%−] : And .
m n017 [ s] : An − And one side effect of t hat would be t hat it ’s
[ disfm arker] um t hat t he phone set would change .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : So t he MLP would be t rained on I t hink only fort y − six or
fort y − eight [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bc] : Eight .

m n017 [ s^ rt ] : fort y − eight phones ?
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s] : Uh which is sm aller t han t he um t han t he phone set t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat we ’ve been using so far .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : And t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat will probably
help , act ually ,
m e018 [ s] : So it ’s a lit t le different ?
m n017 [ s.%−−] : because um t he fewer dim ensions uh e t he less
t rouble probably wit h t he [ disfm arker] as far as just t he um , um
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−−] : Just [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : You know we want t o t ry t hings like delt as on t he t andem
feat ures .
m n017 [ s] : And so you h have t o m ult iply everyt hing by t wo or t hree .
m n017 [ s] : And so , you know , fewer dim ensions in t he [ pause] phone
set would be act ually helpful just from a logist ics point of view .
m e013 [ fg] : Sure .
m e013 [ s.%−] : Alt hough we [ disfm arker] I m ean , it ’s not t hat m any
fewer and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and we t ake a KLT anyway so
we could [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fg] : Right .
m n017 [ fg] : Exact ly .
m n017 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so t hat was t he ot her t hing .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : And t hen we want ed t o s just lim it it t o m aybe uh
som et hing on t he sam e order of dim ensions as we use in a st andard
um front − end .
m n017 [ s] : So t hat would m ean just doing t he t op I don’t know t en or
t welve or som et hing of t he KLT dim ensions .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Yeah , and I t hink [ disfm arker] and we sh again check
[ disfm arker] we should check wit h St ephane .
m e013 [ s] : My im pression was t hat when we did t hat before t hat had
v ery lit t le [ disfm arker] uh he didn’t lose very m uch .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : By just t aking t he t op what ever ?
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah
m e013 [ b] : yeah .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : But t hen [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−−] : And t hen som et hing [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : Once we have t he new M L P t rained up , uh one t hing I
want ed t o t ry just for t he fun of it was t o act ually run uh like a
st andard hybrid sy st em t hat is based on you know , t hose feat ures
m n017 [ fh|s] : uh and uh ret rain MLP and also t he you know , t he
dict ionary t hat we use for t he Hub − fiv e syst em .

m e013 [ s] : And t he b And t he base u st art ing off wit h t he base of t he
alignm ent s t hat y ou got from i from a pret t y decent syst em .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Ex act ly .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : So t hat would basically give us a , um , m ore [ disfm arker]
hopefully a [ disfm arker] a bet t er syst em
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ fh|s] : um because [ disfm arker] you know , com pared t o what
Eric did a while ago , where he t rained up , I t hink , a syst em based on
Broadcast News
m n017 [ s] : and t hen uh t ra ret raining it on Swit chboard
m n017 [ s.%−−] : or s uh and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : But he [ disfm arker] I t hink he d he didn’t [ disfm arker] he
probably didn’t use all t he t raining dat a t hat was available .
m n017 [ s] : And his dict ionary probably wasn’t as t uned t o um
conv ersat ional speech as [ disfm arker] as t he [ disfm arker] as ours is .
m n017 [ s.%−] : So .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : That ’s [ disfm arker] That ’s cert ainly one t hing , yeah .
m n017 [ s] : And t he dict ionary m ade a huge difference .
m e013 [ b] : Uh . Yeah .
m n017 [ fh|s] : Uh . We [ disfm arker] we m ade som e im provem ent s t o
t he dict ionary ’s uh [ disfm arker] t o t he dict ionary about t wo years ago
m n017 [ s] : which result ed in a [ disfm arker] uh som et hing like a four
percent absolut e error rat e reduct ion on Swit chboard ,
m n017 [ %−] : which [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : Well t he ot her t hing is , dipping [ pause] deep int o
hist ory and int o uh our resource m anagem ent days , when we were
collaborat ing wit h SRI before ,
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ b] : Mm m .
m n017 [ s] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh it was [ disfm arker] I t hink , it is was a really key uh
st art ing point for us t hat we act ually got our alignm ent .
m e013 [ s] : When we were working t oget her we got our init ial
alignm ent s from Decipher , uh [ pause] at t he t im e .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh . [ pause] And . Lat er we got away from it because
[ disfm arker] because once we had decent syst em s going t hen it was
[ disfm arker] it was t ypically bet t er t o use our own syst em s
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : cuz t hey were self consist ent

m e013 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] but cert ainly t o st art off when we were
t ry ing t o recover from our init ial hundred and fort y percent error uh
rat e .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh . [ v ocalsound] But t hat was a [ disfm arker] t hat was a
good [ disfm arker] good [ disfm arker] good way t o st art .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : And we ’re not quit e t hat bad wit h our [ disfm arker] our
Swit chboard syst em s but it was [ disfm arker] t hey cert ainly aren’t as
good as SRI ’s ,
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−] : so [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw] : W What is t he perform ance on s t he best Swit chboard
sy st em t hat we ’v e done ?
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ qw^ e] : Roughly ?
m e013 [ s] : Well , t he hybrid syst em we never got bet t er t han about
fift y percent [ pause] error .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And uh it was [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I t hink t here ’s just a whole lot of t hings t hat uh no one
ev er had t im e for .
m e013 [ s] : We nev er did really fix up t he dict ionary .
m e013 [ s] : Uh we always had a list of a half dozen t hings t hat we were
gonna do
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and a lot of t hem were pret t y sim ple and
we never did .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Mm m .
m n017 [ s.%−] : But t hat w
m e013 [ s] : Uh , we never did an never did any adapt at ion
m n017 [ s.%−] : Even t hat [ disfm arker] t hat num ber [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fg] : Right .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−] : uh , we never did any [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] And t hat num ber I t hink was on
Swit chboard − one dat a ,
m n017 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n017 [ s] : Where t he error rat e now is in t he t went ies .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s.%−] : So , um .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So we were [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−] : That ’s yet s
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : We were probably at least a fact or or t wo off .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .

m n017 [ s.%−−] : So it would be [ disfm arker] So it would be good t t o
sort of r re uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : just at least t o give us an idea of how well t he hybrid
sy st em would do .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But I t hink [ disfm arker] again it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s t he conver it ’s t he s conversat ional speech bit .
m e013 [ s] : Because our [ disfm arker] our Broadcast News syst em is
act ually pret t y good .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : He knows .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n017 [ s] : And t he ot her t hing t hat t hat would help us t o evaluat e is
t o see how well t he M L P is t rained up .
m n017 [ qy^ d^ g] : Right ?
m n017 [ s] : Because it ’s a pret t y good um indicat or of t hat .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s^ df] : So it ’s sort of a sanit y check of t he M L P out put s
[ pause] before we go ahead and t rain up t he [ disfm arker] uh you know
, use t hem as a basis for t he t andem syst em .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : It ’ll st ill probably be worse .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’d be cont ext independent and
so on .
m n017 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Should we [ disfm arker] Should we bot her wit h um
using t he net before doing uh em bedded t raining ?
m n017 [ %−] : Not [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−] : But .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : I m ean should [ disfm arker] should we even use t hat ?
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh [ pause] oh t hat ’s a good quest ion .
m e018 [ qrr.%−] : Or should I just go st raight t o [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ h|s^ no] : Yeah , we [ disfm arker] we weren’t sure whet her it ’s
wort h t o just use t he alignm ent s um from t he S R I recognizer
m n017 [ s] : or whet her t o act ually go t hrough one or m ore it erat ions
of em bedded t raining where you realign .
m e011 [ s^ co] : Try it .
m e011 [ s^ co^ rt ] : You run it ?
m e011 [ s^ co^ rt ] : Keep [ disfm arker] keep bot h versions ?
m e011 [ s^ co] : See which one ’s bet t er ?
m e013 [ h|s^ aa] : Uh , yeah .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean . I t hink I agree wit h Ad
m e013 [ s^ cs] : I m ean basically y ou would t hen [ disfm arker] You
proceed wit h t he em bedded t raining .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s gonna t ake you a while t o t rain at t his net anyway .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : And while it ’s t raining you m ay as well t est t he one you

m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m n017 [ b] : Alright .
m e011 [ s] : I could m ake argum ent s eit her way .
m n017 [ s.%−] : But [ disfm arker] But so I [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ %−] : You know , it ’s [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ %−] : Well but i
m e011 [ s] : Sort of given up guessing .
m n017 [ qy ^ rt ] : But in your ex perience I m ean uh have you seen big

m n017 [ qrr] : Or was it sort of sm all − ish uh im prov em ent s t hat you got
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh well . It depended on t he t ask .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean I t hink in t his one I would sort of expect it t o be

m n017 [ b] : Right .

m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ arp.%−] : But I m ean i
m e011 [ s] : I t hink it ’s a bug .

m n017 [ s.%−−] : Hm m . Well , t hat m ight probably just [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I ’m not sure how m uch t hat is .
m n017 [ fg|s.%−−] : Uh , I t hink t hat has about [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ bu] : Well i you ’d [ disfm arker] would be gender − dependent

m e013 [ s.%−] : It ’s m It ’s m ore t han [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : And a t housand is t oo sm all ?
m e013 [ h] : Oh let m e t hink about it ,
m e013 [ s] : but I t hink t hat [ disfm arker] t hat uh t h at som e point t here
’s dim inishing ret urns .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean it doesn’t act ually get worse , t ypically ,
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ e] : but it [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] but t here is
dim inishing ret urns
m e013 [ s] : and you ’re doubling [ pause] t he am ount of t im e .

m n017 [ s] : Rem em ber you ’ll hav e a sm aller out put layer so t here ’s
gonna be fewer param et ers t here .
m e011 [ s^ arp] : But not by a lot .
m e013 [ s^ arp] : Not by m uch .
m n017 [ %−] : And t hen [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Fift y s Fift y four t o fort y eight ?
m e011 [ s] : Vast m ajorit y is from t he input unit .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : It ’ll hav e a very t iny effect .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s] : Right , because you used t he cont ext windows
m e011 [ s] : and so t he input t o hidden is m uch , m uch larger .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh I see ,
m n017 [ s^ bk] : I see ,
m n017 [ s^ bk] : yeah , of course .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ bs|s^ bk] : It ’s negligible , OK .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah , so it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’d be way , way less t han t en
percent of t he difference .
m n017 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : Uh . There ’s uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw.%−] : How bi how big
m e013 [ h] : Let ’s see .
m e013 [ qw^ t 1] : What am I t rying t o t hink of ?
m e018 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] The net t hat [ disfm arker] t hat we did use
already [ pause] uh was eight t housand hidden unit s
m e018 [ s] : and t hat ’s t he one t hat Eric t rained up .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : And t hat was t rained up on uh like a hundred and fort y
hours of [ disfm arker] of speech .
m n017 [ qrr] : Was t hat gender − dependent or independent ?
m e018 [ s] : Gender − dependent .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s] : So t hat would be like t rained on s sixt y or sevent y hours .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So , uh ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : y eah definit ely not t he one t housand uh [ disfm arker]
t wo t housand fr
m e013 [ s] : I m ean t he four t housand will be bet t er
m e013 [ s] : and t he t wo t housand will be alm ost [ disfm arker] will be
fast er and alm ost as good .
m e011 [ s] : It ’ll be fast er .

m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ s] : Maybe I ’ll st art off wit h t wo t housand just t o see .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : OK .
m e018 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah , t hirt y hours is like a hundred and t en t housand
uh seconds .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , so t hat ’s like eleven [ disfm arker] eleven m illion
fram es .
m e013 [ s] : And a t wo t housand hidden unit net is uh I guess about
sev en , eight hundred t housand param et ers .
m e013 [ s] : So t hat ’s probably [ disfm arker] That ’s probably fine .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean a four t housand is well wit hin t he range t hat you
could benefit from
m e013 [ s] : but t he t wo t housand ’d be fast er
m e013 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fg] : Right .
m n017 [ s] : I act ually have t o go .
m n017 [ fh] : So .
