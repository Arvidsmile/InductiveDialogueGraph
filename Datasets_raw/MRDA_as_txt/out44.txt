m e011 [ z] : OK ,
m e011 [ z] : so we should be on .
m n082 [ z] : So
m e011 [ z] : And I ’m gonna go ahead and st art by reading t he digit
st rings ,
m e011 [ z] : just t o give you an ex am ple of how t o do it .
m e011 [ z] : And so t he first t hing t o do is read t he t ranscript num ber
m e011 [ z] : which is [ nonvocalsound] on t he right hand side t here .
m e011 [ z] : And so if you could just go around t he t able
m e011 [ z] : and read t hem out .
fn083 [ z] : OK ,
fn083 [ z] : should I next ?
m e011 [ z] : Yep
m e011 [ z] : If y ou could sign t hat ?
m e011 [ z] : Thanks .
m e011 [ z] : Thanks
m e011 [ z] : So , I want ed t o just era it reit erat e cuz we did have have
one person com e in a lit t le lat er t hat , um t here will be an opport unit y
t o rem ove anyt hing from t he t ranscript t hat you don’t want m ade
public aft er it ’s t ranscribed ,
m e011 [ z] : so t hat ’ll be som e m ont hs off ,

m n082 [ z] : We can do t hat .
fn083 [ z] : Hey , Adam , you know what ?
fn083 [ z] : It m ust be funny t o do an a research on how people [ pause]
behav e while [ pause] reading t hese num bers .
m e011 [ z] : Num bers are st range !
fn083 [ z] : That m ust be [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ z] : It is !
fn083 [ z] : Yeah !
fn083 [ z] : It m ust be m uch m ore int erest ing t o [ disfm arker] t o see
t heir behavior .
m e011 [ z] : t he [ disfm arker] t he m eet ings are st range .
fn083 [ z] : Oh y yeah !
m e011 [ z] : People int errupt each ot her m uch m ore t han I t hought
t hey did .
m n082 [ z] : Two nine seven seven ?
m n082 [ z] : Right .
m e011 [ z] : t wo nine seven seven .
m n082 [ z] : OK .
m n021 [ z] : OK .
m n082 [ z] : Yeah .
m n082 [ z] : I will call you t hen .
m e011 [ z] : Thanks .
m n082 [ fg] : Uh , OK .
m n082 [ s^ co^ rt ^ t ] : So , t hen let ’s st art wit h [ pause] our weekly
m eet ing .
m n082 [ s] : The last t im e ’s uh we learned t oo m uch , I believe ,
m n082 [ fh] : so
m n082 [ fh|s^ t ] : uh , t oday , I have t wo t opics .
m n082 [ s^ t ] : And t he first t opic , um , we have a new m em ber in our
group ,
m n082 [ s^ e] : Miguel Sanchez .
m n082 [ s] : I believe everybody knows him very well in t he m eant im e
because he st ayed here quit e a lit t le t im e
m n021 [ s] : Hi .
m n082 [ s] : and I t hink he is t alking t o everybody in t he m eant im e .
m n082 [ s^ co] : So , but , anyway , I would like t hat Miguel Sanchez will
int roduce him self a lit t le bit , concerning his background , what he
int end t o do .
m n082 [ fh|s] : And [ disfm arker] [ pause] Because I discussing wit h him
uh , uh m any t hings concerning , uh , his skills and what t he [ pause]
NSA group int ends t o do .
m n021 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n082 [ s] : I hope t here will be a m at ch , uh , t hen , for his fut ure work
.
m n082 [ s^ t ] : And t he second t opic is t hen [ pause] t o discuss a
proposal in [ pause] m uch m ore det ail .
m n082 [ s] : I believ e [ pause] we st ill haven’t left our st art ing posit ion .
m n082 [ fh|s] : And , um , yest erday I also discussed wit h Wilbert som e
t hings
m n082 [ s^ co^ t ] : and [ disfm arker] I would like t o focus on t he
quest ion [ com m ent ] " What problem we are going t o solve wit h such a
proposal . "
m n082 [ s] : Not so will t hey have a com m on act ivit y wit hin t he group
it self and m ay be wit h ot her part ners out side ,
m n082 [ s] : but , t he t echnical problem .
m n082 [ s^ df] : But t hat ’s under t he s second t opic ,
m n082 [ s^ co] : so first I would like t hat Miguel will t old us a lit t le bit
about his skills and [ disfm arker] and uh his background .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n021 [ s^ ft ] : t hank you Joe .
m n082 [ s] : So , please .
m n021 [ s] : Well , I , uh , as all of you know I cam e from [ disfm arker]
from Spain ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : from t he uh [ pause] Poly t echnic Universit y of Valencia
m n021 [ fh|s] : and i uh [ pause] I um , just finished m y PHD t hesis
about uh [ pause] um power − saving [ pause] t echniques for wireless
net working .
m n021 [ fh|s] : uh , In fact , I have developed an algorit hm t o cont rol
t he ra radio frequency power uh of a wireless t ransceiver .
m n021 [ fh|s] : And , uh [ pause] I ’ve been working [ disfm arker] also in
rout ing issues , especially in t he so − called ad − hoc net w wireless
net works .
m n021 [ s^ e] : Where uh , you have a set of , uh , m obile nodes and ,
no ot her infrast ruct ure ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : no base st at ions .
m n021 [ s] : So all t he rout ing funct ions are done by t he node
[ disfm arker] by t he sam e nodes .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : So , nodes act as bot h end point s and rout ers .
m n021 [ fh] : eh
m n021 [ s] : I ’v e in t he st udy for som e t im e t hese kind of net works .
m n021 [ s] : And , uh , in fact , t here are a lot of [ disfm arker] of
[ disfm arker] research uh art icles about t his [ disfm arker] t his kind of
net works because You know , uh , m m m infrast ruct ure − based net work
[ disfm arker] net work has been a long t opic of research .
m n021 [ fh] : So ,

m n021 [ s^ e] : for exam ple , rout ing on [ disfm arker] on wired net works
is a [ disfm arker] a t opic st ill t o be researched
m n021 [ s] : but it has an im port ant background .
m n021 [ s] : But m obile net work t his kind of m obile net works is a lit t le
bit [ disfm arker] uh newer ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : especially because uh , unt il not so long uh , t he
[ disfm arker] t he t hings were t oo heav y t o have a com put er , a wireless
t ransceiver , on a m ore or less port able t hing .
m n021 [ fh|s] : So , wit h t he advent of t his new t echnology , low power
uh , high , uh , processing capabilit y and wireless [ disfm arker] eh
[ disfm arker] net working capabilit y , in a really sm all package , new kind
of dev ices are [ disfm arker] are being built and are appearing , in t he
m arket .
m n021 [ fh|s] : And , eh , well t his is m ore or less what I have done .
m n021 [ s] : And t he kind of , uh , t hings , I ’m int erest ed is m ore or
less all , around t his [ disfm arker] t hese [ pause] kind of net works .
m n021 [ s] : But I could say , uh in general , m obile service is not only
about , uh t hese specific kind of net works .
m n021 [ s] : But , in general , about , uh services uh over m obile or
serv ices t hat can benefit from t he [ disfm arker] uh , capabilit y of nodes
t o m ove around .
m n021 [ fh|s] : And , uh , well , I [ disfm arker] I ’ve been t eaching now for
t welve y ears , com p eh At a com put er sciences school in m y universit y ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : I ’v e been t eaching com put er net works .
m n021 [ s] : And , well , I am [ disfm arker] m ore or less uh ,
knowledgable about , well , TCP IP net working , ISO uh , net working ,
m n021 [ fh] : and , uh
m n021 [ s] : well I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m a com put er guy ,
m n021 [ s] : so I ’m really [ disfm arker] um Well , I can say uh , proudly
uh , m ore or less , com put er skilled .
m n021 [ s^ e] : I m ean , uh , operat ing sy st em s uh , program m ing
languages uh , net working @ @ .
m n021 [ s] : So t his kind of t hings I t hink I ’m m ore or less well − t rained
.
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ s] : t his is , I t hink , um , m y first present at ion .
m n021 [ s^ cc] : Next [ disfm arker] m aybe next m eet ing I will uh , do a
sm all sket ch about uh , m y past work , and [ disfm arker] well ,
present ing som e det a lit t le bit m ore det ailed approach wit h som e
schem es and [ disfm arker] and som e t hings from previous t alks , so
y ou can hav e a bet t er idea of w t he kind of work I ’ve been doing .
m n021 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ?
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s^ ft ] : Thank you .
m n082 [ s^ ft ] : So , t hanks , Miguel .

m n082 [ s] : Yeah , we m discussed it yest erday t hat you ’ll m aybe
[ disfm arker] will hav e a t alk [ pause] next Tuesday
m n021 [ %] : Y
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ co] : But , Give m e a sign and send m e an abst ract so t hat I

m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : That ’s OK .
m n082 [ fh] : Um .
m n082 [ s^ t c] : One short ot her t opic is Uh . Claudia did a lot of work
concerning t he web pages in t he m eant im e .

m n082 [ s] : And any feedback is t hen , well appreciat ed .
m n082 [ %] : No ?
m n021 [ b] : OK .
m n082 [ fg] : So .
m n082 [ s^ co^ t ^ t c] : Let ’s swit ch t o t he project proposal .
m n082 [ fh|s.%−] : Um , I m ent ioned t hat it is st ill f
fn083 [ fg] : Ah .
fn083 [ s^ fa] : Sorry .
fn083 [ qy .%−] : Can I ?
m n082 [ qw^ d] : Yeah ?
fn083 [ s] : May be I can add som et hing .
m n082 [ %] : Claudia [ disfm arker]
fn083 [ s] : Yeah , if t here ’s anyt hing else which we [ disfm arker] what
we could add on t he web sit e .
fn083 [ s] : So , p For exam ple , if you hav e a sm all abst ract or som e
pict ures or what ev er , about t he work y ou did before , what you are
planning t o do here , t hat would be fine ,
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fn083 [ s^ df] : cuz now we can add som e m ore [ pause] st uff t here .
fn083 [ s] : Or if you have som et hing [ disfm arker] or if som ebody has
som e slides , o or art icles , what ever he want s t o be [ pause] published
t here .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .

m n082 [ s] : Then ev erybody sees t he st ruct ure , [ disfm arker] how it is
uh , st ruct ured [ disfm arker] really st ruct ured .
fn083 [ s^ bk] : Yeah
fn083 [ fh] : and
m n082 [ s] : Then [ pause] m ay be y ou wi can easy offer som e addit ional
input which should be present ed , t hen , on t he web pages .
fn083 [ s^ bk|s^ ng] : Yeah , it depends what [ disfm arker] what
ev ery body want s t o do .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
fn083 [ fg] : So
fn083 [ s] : about t he project s will be som et hing ,
fn083 [ s] : t hen , about publicat ions will be anot her point ,
fn083 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] Yeah , addit ional inform at ion about how is
life in Berkeley and i Yep . I don’t know , [ pause] som e [ disfm arker]
som e hint s , som e web sit es or links which are useful when som ebody
arriv es or st uff like t hat .
m n082 [ s^ na] : Yeah , it is .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : Half collect ion of necessary inform at ion .
m n030 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : But t here ’s no personal hom epage for
ev ery body ?
m n030 [ fh|qr] : Or , [ pause] is it planned or not ,
m n082 [ %−] : Yeah su You can have [ disfm arker]
m n030 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m n082 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , you can have it .
m n082 [ s^ df.%−] : Because , as uh [ disfm arker] Uh , uh , le
m n030 [ s^ nd] : I ’m not int erest ed in t his .
m n030 [ s^ df] : That m akes work .
m n082 [ s^ ar] : No ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : but t his is [ disfm arker] oh , uh [ disfm arker] Everybody
’s obliged t o do it for his own , you know .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s] : So t here is not uh [ disfm arker] Claudia is not t he
webm ast er here t o , uh , [ vocalsound] [ pause] get t he collect ion for
[ disfm arker] for [ disfm arker] for everyt hing .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fn083 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Oh , oh , no , I ’m not doing it for everybody
m n082 [ fg] : So .
fn083 [ s.%−] : but what I can [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : This is responsible for [ disfm arker] uh , everybody ’s
responsible for his own ,
m n082 [ fh] : yeah .

fn083 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker] but what is planned is t hat I
do som et hing like a previous , you know , layout , and give everybody
t he , uh , opin uh , t he possibilit y t o [ disfm arker] t he chance t o put his
[ pause] cont ent inside
m n030 [ b] : Sure .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n030 [ s] : his nam e and so on .
fn083 [ s^ df] : so t hat t he layout is for everybody t he sam e ,
m n030 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s] : Well , like have a [ pause] blueprint .
fn083 [ s^ df] : so about t he project s and st uff .
m n030 [ b] : OK
m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn083 [ s] : So , t here will be som et hing .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n082 [ s^ ft ] : t hanks .
m n082 [ fg] : So ,
m n082 [ s^ co^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : let ’s swit ch t o t he proposal .
m n082 [ s] : I ask everybody whet her [ pause] read it in t he m eant im e ,
and underst and everyt hing .
m n082 [ %] : Yeah .
m n082 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : Everybody say yes ?
m n082 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : Yeah ?
m n030 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yes ,
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ fh] : Um .
m n082 [ s] : From m y point of v iew , As I m ent ioned before , we st ill in
t he st art ing posit ion .
m n082 [ s] : I t hink t he four building blocks on t he net work level will
have really a m ajor im pact on [ disfm arker] on f current um , available
wireless net works and , uh , also for fut ure generat ions .
m n082 [ fh|s] : And , what t he m issing t hing is really what kind of
problem we are [ disfm arker] wan wanna s solve wit h such a project
proposal .
m n082 [ s] : And Wilbert yest erday m ent ioned , and he is right ,
[ com m ent ] [ v ocalsound] t hat , what kind of , m aybe , service we are
really going t o offer .
m n082 [ s] : The linkage bet ween such kind of applicat ion , also
int eract iv e m ult im edia applicat ion and , uh , t his kind of net working
st uff is , um , m aybe not very well aligned ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : because t here will be of course , a port ion of m obile
access t o such kind of applicat ion .
m n082 [ s] : But , I t hink t hat ’s not t he m ajorit y

m n082 [ s] : and t hat is not t he m ajor focus of um t his kind of
[ disfm arker] um [ pause] t his kind of applicat ion anyway .
m n082 [ s] : So I would like t o [ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker] uh split , in
principle , t he discussions of [ pause] what kind of applicat ion t sk
[ com m ent ] um f far away
m n082 [ s] : and I would like t o [ disfm arker] m ore t o focus if we have
cert ain kind of v ision t concerning t hese building blocks and t he
net work , Um , What kind of problem we are going t o solve .
m n082 [ s] : What kind of , uh , um , um , glue bet ween t hese four
building blocks exist s
m n082 [ fh|s] : and what kind of synergy effect s , in principle , as if t hey
work and fit very well t oget her exist s for net working st uff .
m n082 [ s] : And what kind of serv ice could we provide [ pause] in t hat
area .
m n082 [ s] : We will have t hese kind of , uh , really closely working
t oget her of t hese four building blocks .
m n082 [ s^ co] : So m aybe uh , Wilbert , you can st art t o discu oder t o
[ disfm arker] t o t ell t he group about what y ou m ent ioned yest erday
concerning cert ain kind of ideas .
m n082 [ s^ am ] : May be it ’s a brainst orm ing um , of [ disfm arker] of
t hese t hings
m n082 [ s^ cs] : and m aybe we can com m ent lat er on t h t hese
[ disfm arker] uh t hese ideas .
m n082 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : And I saw you sk st ill discuss wit h
[ disfm arker] wit h [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] Mark , right ?
m n082 [ s^ e] : som e st uff .
m n082 [ qy ] : Was it also relat ed wit h [ disfm arker] wit h t hese t hings .
m n081 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n082 [ s^ bk^ m ] : No ?
m n082 [ s] : OK , It was @ @ .
m n081 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : This aft ernoon you m ean ?
m n082 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n081 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : No , t his was [ pause] unrelat ed t o [ disfm arker]
t o t he t hings of yest erday and last weeks
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK
m n082 [ b] : Yeah , yeah .
m n082 [ s^ cs] : Then , m aybe t hen , one [ disfm arker] one w uh
sent ence before .
m n081 [ %−] : wha
m n082 [ s] : I believe everybody fit s v ery well in t hese kind of t hings .
m n082 [ s^ df] : Because from t he m at hem at ical descript ion wit h QS − in
− Adv ance , m e , as an expert for qualit y of service and , uh , Michael as
an expert for uh , MPLS and Wilbert an expert for [ disfm arker] for
Mult icast , and , uh , I discussed wit h Miguel . It ’s uh m aybe a lit t le bit
t he shift t o act ive rout ing ,
m n082 [ s] : but it is st ill in t he area of rout ing .

m n082 [ s^ cs] : So . My idea is , in principle , t o have , independent ly of
any funding , independent ly of any out er cont act , such [ disfm arker]
such a [ disfm arker] core act ivit y , in principle .
m n082 [ s^ cs] : And we can see how m uch from t he out er world can fit
in .
m n082 [ s] : First of all , t he first st age is t he inst it ut ion which is behind
ev ery body .
m n082 [ s^ e] : That m eans uh KPN in y our case and Siem ens in our
case .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : And m aybe , t hen , in t he broader world here ot her
part ners regist ered in t he proposal m igh
m n082 [ s^ e] : Tom orrow , I will go t o Cisco , for inst ance ,
m n082 [ s^ cc] : and I will discuss uh , all t his kind of t hings .
m n082 [ s^ am ] : Maybe t hey hav e cert ain addit ional act ivit ies and t hey
’re int erest ed in t he result s before [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : The benefit here is , in principle , t hat t he result s are
av ailable .
m n082 [ s^ df] : They are not rest rict ed any way .
m n082 [ s] : If you have your own com m on act ivit y . That m akes a lit t le
bit m ore easier .
m n082 [ fh|s] : And , uh , if t here is a t echnical linkage bet ween such ,
uh um , bet ween t he out er world and us OK , t he bet t er it is .
m n082 [ s] : But , anyway , if we com e t o a cert ain kind of [ pause] uh ,
com m on work wit hin t he core of t he NSA group , I t hink t hat ’s really
beneficial t o ev ery body .
m n082 [ fh|s] : And [ pause] uh , especially , Wilbert , if you have in m ind
t o go in t he [ com m ent ] m m m , uh , really from t he project proposal
v iew , I t hink we can build it on t his [ disfm arker] t his core .
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : You know ,
m n082 [ s] : and go t o t he out er world wit h , and [ disfm arker] and
[ disfm arker] and align it in a cert ain way .
m n082 [ s^ cs] : For inst ance , t hat it also fit , m aybe , t o KPN , and
Siem ens , and in ot her com panies .
m n082 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n081 [ s] : Yeah , and [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] This probably has t o
be a brainst orm [ com m ent ] right now .
m n082 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m n081 [ fg|s] : Um [ pause] What I t old Joachim yest erday was t hat , uh
uh for m y com pany [ disfm arker] t he com pany I work for , t hey are m ore
int erest ed in [ disfm arker] in an explicit service , t han in core

m n081 [ %] : u
m n081 [ s] : Me , on t he ot her hand , I ’m m ore int erest ed in uh , core
serv ice , or c core t echnology , m yself .
m n081 [ s] : So I ’m u I was t hinking about [ pause] uh , how I could
com bine t he bot h of t hem .

m n081 [ s] : KPN was , um [ disfm arker] t hey ’re int erest ed in having , uh
like , six people or som et hing , working on t he project for one year
m n081 [ s] : or m ay be , uh , t hree people fo working on t he project for
t wo y ears ,
m n081 [ s] : and have a kind of a dem onst rat ion uh , for a specifically in
UMTS service .
m n021 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n081 [ s^ cs] : I was t hinking t hat um as a [ disfm arker] well , not really
a UMTS serv ice , but [ disfm arker] [ pause] yest erday , what I discussed
wit h Joachim was uh , a w lit t le bit based on your ad − hoc net working
also .
m n081 [ s] : That it would be int erest ing t o have a kind of a device
where y ou can swit ch from w a Wav eLAN Technology t o , um , UMTS .
m n081 [ s] : I t hink t hat ’s , uh , it ’s in [ disfm arker] in t he fut ure t hat
will be a m ain com pet it or of , uh , of UMTS ,
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .
m n081 [ s^ e] : t oo , like t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] [ pause] t he
Lucent , uh , equipm ent has a l huge scope already ,
m n081 [ s^ e] : like fiv e hundred feet , or [ disfm arker] or ev en m ore
som et im es .
m n081 [ s] : so t hat ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s m ight be int erest ing for , a
serv ice t o walk int o a building or what ev er is available on t hat net work
.
m n081 [ s] : You can swit ch from UMTS or uh uh , t o WaveLAN
Technologies .
m n082 [ b] : Hm m .
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : Uh , m aybe I will writ e a few keywords on t he [ disfm arker]
on t he whit eboard
m n081 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m n082 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK .
m n081 [ s] : Of course , it sounds st range for a com pany t hat does
UMTS t o swit ch [ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker] t o be able t o swit ch or
prov ide t he service t o swit ch t o WaveLAN
m n081 [ s^ df] : but at t he end it m akes it easier for your [ disfm arker]
and cheaper for y our cust om ers .
m n081 [ s^ df] : So , if t hey don’t do it , som ebody else will probably do
it .
m n021 [ s] : And y ou can build a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] an [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a double t echnology
adapt er , t oo .
m n021 [ s] : So y ou can m arket t hese double − t echnology adapt ers .
m n021 [ s^ df] : And , t his can be a [ disfm arker] a pot ent ial uh um you
know , uh , incom e , t oo .
m n081 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .

m n021 [ s^ df] : Because you just have t o license , uh uh WaveLAN
t echnology .
m n021 [ s] : You can build , uh , t he whole t hing .
m n081 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n021 [ s] : This U − UMTS Wav eLAN , uh m ixed t oget her .
m n081 [ %] : and [ disfm arker]
m n081 [ s^ bk|s^ na] : Yeah , som et hing like t hat could be possible ,
m n081 [ s^ cs] : m aybe even a UMTS − t o − WaveLAN − gat eway ,
m n081 [ s^ df^ no] : or [ disfm arker] I ’m not sure if t hat ’s possible like
we U − if UMTS re cont ains redirect s or what ever , like swit ches .
m n081 [ s^ no] : I ’m not sure about it .
m n081 [ s] : It could be .
m n021 [ b] : Mm m .
m n021 [ s] : I t hink , t hey are using different , uh , radio t echnologies .
m n021 [ fh|s] : So , [ pause] uh , at t he physical level , t hey ’re
[ disfm arker] t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t hey are not com pat ible .
m n081 [ s] : It ’s not a problem .
m n081 [ fg|s] : No , but s You could have a UMTS gat eway t hat
t ranslat es everyt hing t o t hat uh w local @ @ .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n081 [ s^ e] : If you will
m n021 [ s^ aa] : That [ disfm arker] t hat ’s right .
m n082 [ s^ bu] : Yet t he basic idea is , in principle , t o swit ch
seam lessly bet ween wireless [ pause] LAN t echnology , what ever and
[ pause] UMTS ,
m n082 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n081 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m n082 [ fh|s^ rt ] : And [ pause] you see t he benefit t hat , in principle ,
t he cust om er will save a lot of m oney .
m n082 [ s^ df] : Because if [ pause] in − house com m unicat ion like
Wav eLAN or m aybe I see it also in t he Am erican m arket , som e
Wav eLAN com m unicat ion in t he out er world will be available , t he
[ disfm arker] m and t hat is your assum pt ion , t hat t he m ore cost uh
ex t ensiv e um U M T S connect ion could be principle used , I would like
t o say , over WaveLAN ,
m n082 [ s|qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : and t hen I hav e a norm al WaveLAN connect ion
, right ?
m n081 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m n082 [ s] : And t he rout er and t he WaveLAN connect ion goes int o t he
core int ernet elsewhere
m n082 [ fh|s] : and t he connect ion is not dropped bet ween t his
seam less hand off I would like t o say .
m n081 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m n082 [ %−] : or what [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker]

m n081 [ h] : Well ,
m n081 [ s^ no] : If [ pause] connect ion is lost , I am [ disfm arker] I ’m not
sure if som et im es y ou ’d sim ply hav e t o drop a connect ion . If you have
out st anding connect ions .
m n082 [ %−] : What [ disfm arker]
m n035 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n081 [ s] : But t hat ’s uh one t hing of t he int ernet ,
m n081 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n081 [ s] : It ’s [ pause] should be able t o unplug a host , bring it
som ewhere else and everyt hing cont inues like it should be .
m n081 [ s^ no] : I ’m not sure i if it ’s uh [ pause] if you really have t o
con uh save a connect ion for all applicat ions ,
m n081 [ s^ nd] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t t hink so .
m n082 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , but if t his is t he final goal ,
m n082 [ s] : it should be as m uch as possible available t hat you do not
have t o break t he connect ion if you swit ch bet ween t he subnet s ’
t echnology
m n082 [ qy^ d^ g] : Right ?
m n021 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah but I [ disfm arker] I hav e a point uh regarding
t he [ disfm arker] t his quest ion , is eh t he cost funct ion .
m n021 [ fh] : I m ean .
m n021 [ fh] : uh
m n021 [ qo] : What about t he user who is swit ching from one
[ disfm arker] let ’s say [ disfm arker] zero − cost area net work t o anot her
[ pause] net work where he has t o pay .
m n021 [ s] : It is OK [ pause] for t he service t o cont inue when he uh
swit ches from one net work t o anot her .
m n021 [ s] : But probably , t he user want s t o be aware t hat he ’s
swit ching from one place [ disfm arker] from one net work t o anot her .
m n021 [ s^ df] : Because m aybe , [ vocalsound] while he ’s uh having ,
let ’s say , a [ pause] vide video conference uh over t he [ disfm arker]
t he Wav eLAN oh he ’s not paying any ext ra cost .
m n021 [ s] : But when he cont inues wit h t his service on t he UMTS , he
’s hav ing t o cover uh an im port ant [ disfm arker] let ’s say , an im port ant
cost [ disfm arker] or som e cost , non − null cost .
m n082 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n082 [ s^ na] : non − null
m n021 [ fh] : So [ pause] uh
m n021 [ s] : t his can be som et hing t hat probably t he user want s t o be
aware of .
m n021 [ s^ df] : Of course , t his doesn’t m ean t hat t he user want s t he
connect ion t o be dropped when he swit ches . t o t he w uh [ disfm arker]
r uh from t he zero − cost area net work t o [ disfm arker] t o t he
[ disfm arker] uh um non − null cost area net work .
m n021 [ s] : But m ay be som e users want t o do t his .
m n021 [ s^ df:s^ bk] : Because t hey say " OK [ disfm arker]

m n021 [ s^ df:s^ nd] : I ’m not willing t o pay any back for t his service ,
m n021 [ s^ df:s^ df] : because I ’m just wat ching [ pause] uh you know
t he sport s news .
m n021 [ s] : So , if I swit ch [ disfm arker] If [ disfm arker] if , because of m y
m ot ion , I ’m swit ching , or I ’m going out of t he coverage of t he
[ disfm arker] of t he uh wave [ disfm arker] uh wireless uh local area
net work , well , I [ disfm arker] I want t he service t o be uh st opped . "
m n021 [ s] : And t his can be som e pat t ern t hen t hat [ pause] som e
users will follow .
m n035 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : Yeah , but if y our s
m n082 [ fh|s^ ng] : uh I believe everybody is aware about t he USAIA
archit ect ure .
m n082 [ fh|s] : And uh t his one is , here , [ disfm arker] t his st uff is ,
here , also relat ed t o t his kind what is m ent ioned t here concerning t he
end sy st em .
m n082 [ s] : And in m y conf uh considered end syst em , t here is a
cert ain kind of policy , concerning how t o use subnet s t echnologies
and [ disfm arker] and all t hese kind of t hings .
m n082 [ s^ e] : How t o use qualit y of serv ice , you know , in advance ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : because you have t o pay for cert ain t echnologies and
m ay be for cert ain services .
m n082 [ s] : And t hat should not be done aut om at ically .
m n082 [ s] : But it could be done aut om at ically .
m n082 [ s] : But nev ert heless t here m ust be a cert ain kind of um user
int eract ion always possible , t hat you could set up a cert ain kind of
m ini − dat abase how t o deal wit h all t hese kind of t hings .
m n082 [ s^ ba] : I t hink t hat ’s not a problem .
m n082 [ s] : But uh what I [ disfm arker] I would like t o ask Wilbert here ,
and we discuss it yest erday , " Is it only t he usage of t hat PCMCIA card
where y ou hav e [ disfm arker] inst ead of GSM t oday , UMTS , and
inst ead of wireless LAN t oday also wireless LAN .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : Rem em ber your four and one [ pause] card uh
concerning um ,
m n082 [ qw.%−−] : what is t he nam e , from Dat aco − ?
m n082 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n082 [ s] : Dacom
m n081 [ s^ bk|qy ^ bu^ d] : Oh , t he one I have Sit com ?
m n082 [ s^ df] : Where you can enable four t echnologies , and you plug
in , in y our lapt op
m n081 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ df] : and t hen you have every four uh subnet layer
t echnologies available in your lapt op .
m n082 [ qy^ rt ] : Is t hat t he problem ?
m n082 [ s^ nd] : Yeah , t hat ’s not t he problem .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Right .

m n081 [ fg] : Um .
m n081 [ s^ am ] : Well , t he swit ching it self could be a problem .
m n082 [ qw] : Why ?
m n081 [ s^ am ] : Becau − well it ’s a depends
m n081 [ s^ am ] : if one of t he ot her net works is available , m aybe you
are ,
m n081 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m n081 [ s^ cs] : So t hat could be a t t opic for research ,
m n082 [ fg|%−] : Yeah , but t his i
m n081 [ s^ am ] : so m aybe you know m ore about it .
m n082 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , but t his is t h only t he probing t o figure out
t hat y ou get at a cert ain locat ion t he inform at ion t hat a s cert ain
cov erage of a cert ain subnet t echn t echnology is available .
m n082 [ s] : And if so , t hen what Miguel m ent ions , t hen you add a
cert ain kind of policy , t o swit ch [ pause] or not t o swit ch , t o t his kind
of t echnology ,
m n081 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n081 [ s^ aa] : Y Yes .
m n082 [ s] : But t his is end − syst em relat ed .
m n082 [ s] : That ’s not net work relat ed .
m n082 [ s] : I see no net work relat ed st uff wit hin t hese [ disfm arker] in
t his uh idea .
m n081 [ fg] : Um .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : It ’s only t o set up i u
m n082 [ s] : For m e it ’s like a lapt op t t o plug one PCMCIA [ disfm arker]
and current ly will have t wo PCMCIA cards , and I com pare GSM wit h
UMTS .
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : And t oday I would like t o have GSM ,
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : and t hen I have m y GSM connect ivit y .
m n082 [ s] : And I cannot use it [ pause] ot her t echnology ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : only GSM , because t he int erfaces , t he driver int erface
, does not perm it m e t o swit ch bet ween t he [ disfm arker] bet ween
different t echnologies .
m n082 [ s^ e] : So if I want t o go t o wireless LAN I have t o st op m y
connect ion and put in m y wireless LAN PCMCIA card ,
m n082 [ s^ e] : and t hen I can go on and set up t he [ disfm arker] t he
sam e connect ion one m ore t im e .
m n082 [ s] : And what you have in m ind , t o do it a bit m ore seam lessly
, and t hat m akes an only sense for m e if bot h t echnologies , in
principle , were close t oget her in t hat sense for applicat ion .
m n082 [ s^ e^ rt ] : For inst ance , t he applicat ion would be t hat I have
m y lapt op here ,
m n082 [ s^ e] : and I work here wit h [ disfm arker] wi wit h m y device ,
m n082 [ s^ e] : any kind of device ,

m n082 [ s^ e] : and I work here in wireless LAN area .
m n082 [ s^ e] : And t hen I go out side , and [ pause] want t o go st ill on ,
leav ing t he coverage of [ disfm arker] uh of t he [ disfm arker] uh wireless
LAN .
m n082 [ s^ e^ rt ] : And at a cert ain st at e , t he device uh receives
cert ain signals t hat t he coverage of UMTS or GSM is available .
m n082 [ s^ e] : And at t hat st at e , y ou aut om at ically , or based on t he
cert ain kind of user profile , swit ched t o t he um UMTS [ com m ent ] or
GSM st uh net work .
m n082 [ s^ ba] : That ’s t he only senseful applicat ion .
m n082 [ s] : From m y underst anding , t hat m eans only t o have a
cert ain kind of cont rol layer for t he different drivers ,
m n082 [ s^ e] : which you also m ent ioned as a USAIA archit ect ure .
m n082 [ fh|s] : and uh t hen t o do t he [ pause] swit ching for an exist ing
st ream or applicat ion bet ween t hese [ disfm arker] uh , t ransparent ly t o
t his applicat ion , bet ween t hose uh t hese bot h t echnologies .
m n082 [ s^ am ] : Maybe t here ’s m ore pot ent ial .
m n082 [ s^ no] : I don’t s see it ,
m n082 [ s^ am ] : but m aybe you have a addit ional idea .
m n082 [ s] : And I don’t t hink t hat t his [ pause] end syst em device uh
archit ect ure , which will com e aut om at ically .
m n082 [ s] : And I believe t here ’s a lot of act ivit y t hroughout t he world ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : because t his seam lessly com m unicat ion is always
m ent ioned elsewhere where you cou where you list en t o .
m n082 [ fh] : So
m n082 [ fh] : uh [ pause] uh
m n081 [ s^ ba^ cs] : If [ disfm arker] if you can leav e it out t he net work
t hat will be really cool .
m n081 [ s^ df] : That ’s what you w what I would like t o do ,
m n081 [ fh] : so
m n081 [ fh] : Yes .
m n021 [ s^ nd] : But when qualit y of service com es t o t he uh scene ,
well , I t hink [ pause] we have a [ disfm arker] a bigger problem
m n021 [ s^ df] : because m aybe t his [ disfm arker] t his uh uh seam less
m igrat ion cannot be seam less at all ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : because m aybe t he [ disfm arker] t he qualit y of service
we are get t ing when we are [ pause] connect ed t o a cert ain net work ,
let ’s say high − speed net working , cannot be [ pause] sust ained when
we are swit ching t o a different t echnology .
m n021 [ s] : So , t his is anot her t hing t hat is uh put t ing a lit t le bit in
m ore t rouble our [ disfm arker] our schem e
m n021 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : Now , I would like not t o hear only t hree opinions .
m n035 [ %] : Hm
m n082 [ s] : But m ay be t here are also ot her opinions .
m n021 [ b] : OK .

m n021 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ fa] : Oh , sorry .
m n082 [ s^ co.%−−] : And m aybe everybody should uh give a short

m n035 [ s.%−] : I t hink you [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : Let us underst and , built for ev erybody and t heir com

m n035 [ b] : Yeah .
m n035 [ s^ cs.%−−] : I t hink we should [ disfm arker]
m n035 [ qy ^ cs^ d^ rt ] : In t his t hing of seam less handoff [ disfm arker] or

m n035 [ s^ df] : So one layer is [ pause] having t he seam less handov er .
m n035 [ s] : It ’s clear if a t echnology doesn’t provide t hat [ pause]
qualit y of service , you can’t do m agic and have it .
m n035 [ s] : There are cert ain const raint s on t hat .
m n035 [ s^ aa] : It ’s t rue .
m n035 [ s] : That ’s st ill in m ind .
m n035 [ s] : But for [ disfm arker] wit h t he cases t here [ disfm arker]
There , it is possible .
m n035 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : So t hat should be m ade possible t hen ?
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yeah .
m n035 [ fg] : So
m n021 [ s^ na] : It can be done .
m n021 [ s^ df] : It is just [ disfm arker] Mm m uh Trying t o [ disfm arker] t o
[ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker] t o poi t o pinpoint The [ disfm arker] t he

m n035 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n035 [ s] : There are st ill enough problem s i [ pause] in doing it .
m n035 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n035 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m n035 [ s] : But it m ight be t he wrong t hing t o prom ise , uh , t en
m egabit s t o everywhere .
m n035 [ s] : There y ou are .
m n035 [ s] : But saying " OK if it ’s [ pause] a [ disfm arker] if t he
t echnology is OK , you can do it . "
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s] : In fact , if you t ake t he slower t echnology [ pause] of t he
ones y ou are planning t o [ disfm arker] t o support , you can offer t his

m n035 [ b] : Yep .
m n035 [ b] : Yep .
m n035 [ b] : Yeah .

m n021 [ fh|s] : So , if everybody is [ disfm arker] is asking for less t han
t his m inim um am ount , no problem at all .
m n021 [ s^ cs] : But in t his case , m aybe not t oo m uch effort should be
put [ pause] on prov iding t his qualit y of service
m n021 [ s^ df] : because you just have a [ disfm arker] usually a huge
[ pause] bandwidt h com pared on a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] w wit h
what t he user is [ disfm arker] is using .
m n035 [ b] : Yeah .
m n035 [ b] : Yep .
m n035 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s^ e] : I m ean , if you have a t en m egabit s bandwidt h and t he

m n021 [ s^ e] : But probably in [ disfm arker] it isn’t [ disfm arker] it is not

uh it is not a problem .
m n082 [ z] : Oh , please com e in .

m n021 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n082 [ s] : Good luck .
m n081 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he t hing is t hat we are looking for a

m n081 [ %−] : So we [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : Rout ing ?

m n021 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I just uh t ake a
[ disfm arker] a quick uh look at t he [ disfm arker] at t he t hing
m n021 [ s^ df] : because I [ disfm arker] I was [ disfm arker] uh read
about t his uh a long t im e ago .
m n021 [ s] : And it [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he lat est report I
[ disfm arker] I found was in ninet een ninet y eight .
m n021 [ s^ df] : And in t his report , well , t hey [ disfm arker] t hey pres
[ pause] t hey have uh som e slides , som e uh papers , som e
[ disfm arker] well , a lot of t hings .
m n081 [ b] : Hm m .
m n021 [ s] : And [ pause] well t he m ain t hing and t he quick uh t hing I
[ disfm arker] I was uh looking at was a [ disfm arker] a video av ailable in
MP − t hr [ pause] in MPG M − peg form at .
m n021 [ fh] : And uh
m n021 [ s^ e] : well [ pause] what t his video was present ing was a kind
of t est of [ disfm arker] of one guy wit h a [ pause] port able com put er ,
m ov ing across different net works .
m n021 [ s^ e] : So st art ing at t he CS depart m ent at Berkeley

m n021 [ s^ e] : and t hen going out t he st reet
m n021 [ s^ e] : swit ching t o t he [ disfm arker] a cam pus − wide net work ,
m n021 [ fh|s] : uh um I t hink it ’s a Met ricom uh net work ,
m n021 [ s.%−] : an which is uh a t est [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s|qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : A Ricochet here , right ?
m n021 [ s^ m ^ na] : Ricochet ,

m n021 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : OK .
m n021 [ s^ e] : I [ disfm arker] as lo uh as t he [ disfm arker] as t he user is
m ov ing out of t he [ disfm arker] of t he coverage area of t his second
net work .
m n021 [ s^ e] : And , well , what t hey hav e built is a a [ disfm arker] kind
of uh prox y st ruct ure .
m n021 [ s^ e] : So t hey are [ disfm arker] t hey are put t ing m ost of t he
work of t his adapt at ional layer on [ disfm arker] [ pause] on t he side of
t he prox ies .
m n021 [ s] : So t he client or t he server is not changed .
m n021 [ s] : It is t he prox y , t he one t hat does t he work .
m n081 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ,
m n021 [ s.%−] : so y ou can even , for exam ple , use [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : It ’s t he sam e ?
m n082 [ s] : Ah we just discussed a lot about proxies .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .

m n021 [ s^ df] : It would be im port ant for us [ disfm arker] t o
[ disfm arker] t o highlight t he differences .
m n081 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ df:s] : Because if not , well , t hey can say , " Oh , you are

m n082 [ s.%−−] : So t hat everybody [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ fh|s^ cc] : Uh [ pause] I [ disfm arker] I will send also t he point er
which Miguel sent t o m e , t o everybody so t hat everybody can t ake a

m n081 [ s.%−] : I was [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ fh|s^ no] : And uh I don’t know what avail inform at ion is
av ailable
m n082 [ s^ df] : because I didn’t find t he t im e current ly t o check it out .
m n030 [ s] : It ’s a project of t he UC .
m n082 [ s.%−] : But first of [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n030 [ s^ aa] : Oh , yeah .
m n021 [ s^ na] : UC Ber − uh Berkeley ,
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .

m n021 [ s.%−] : May be t he project [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ fh] : n uh
m n081 [ s^ ba] : It ’s funny .
m n082 [ qw^ br^ rt ] : Uh , sorry ?
m n082 [ %] : Uh do [ disfm arker]
m n081 [ s] : Yeah , yest erday I was just surfing a lit t le bit .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .

m n082 [ s^ bk] : Ah !
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n082 [ s^ bk] : I see .

m n081 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right .
m n081 [ s] : And he ’s also board in Nokia research ,
m n021 [ b] : OK .
m n081 [ fh] : so
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s^ t ^ t c] : Then t he second t hing is t hat uh Daim ler − Chrysler

m n021 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s^ df] : They have a specific ant enna for uh GSM [ pause] Oh ,

m n082 [ s] : In t he roof of t he car . They have a s lot of servers
m n082 [ s] : in t he [ pause] t runk of t he car . Then t hey collect dat a
how it is [ disfm arker] wit h handoff and all t hese kind of t hings
m n082 [ s] : and t hey are driving around t he different areas .
m n082 [ s] : And t he sam e car exist s here in Palo Alt o uh based on

m n021 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : They collect t he dat collect [ disfm arker] collect ing a lot of
dat a . concerning t he seam less handoffs and whet her it works very

m n082 [ fh] : and um
m n082 [ s] : uh , Thom as is going t o build m obile IP st uff in t heir servers
.
m n082 [ fh] : uh
m n082 [ s^ df.%−−] : because t hey want t o
m n082 [ s] : use current t echnology wit h a c a com binat ion of m obile IP
. So I t hink t here is a lot of act ivit ies in t he area .
m n082 [ fh] : Uh .
m n082 [ s] : And m y t hird uh com m ent is uh if we are going [ pause]
som et hing in t hat direct ion t hat is quit e different from t his t hing
[ pause] here .
m n082 [ fh|s] : But , anyway , m aybe as a core t echnology wit h a real

m n082 [ s] : I see som e difficult y because nobody current ly has here
cert ain kind uh of UMTS know how .
m n021 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : And you need it definit ely

m n082 [ s^ df] : because t hen [ disfm arker] it j m ust be your uh Bible I
would like t o say t hat you are very fam iliar wit h UMTS if you wanna go in
[ disfm arker] in t hat way .
m n082 [ s] : And As far as I know t he UMTS st andardizat ion is not

m n082 [ s^ e] : Ninet y percent , m ay be , or eight y percent .
m n082 [ s^ no] : I kno I ’m not sure .
m n082 [ fh] : But [ pause] uh
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah
m n021 [ s^ co] : b le let m e [ disfm arker] let m e ask you [ vocalsound] a

m n082 [ %−] : t hat [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n021 [ fh|qy] : Uh , from t he point of view of t he user , uh [ pause] is
t here uh som et hing m ore t hat [ disfm arker] nnn , t hat [ disfm arker]
t han m ore speed ?
m n021 [ qy] : Is t here any ot her adv ant age , from t he point of view of
t he user or of [ disfm arker] of t he t erm inals ?
m n082 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Users of [ disfm arker] of UMTS ?
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s] : You can request cert ain kind of QS .
m n082 [ s] : You can even request it in GPS
m n082 [ s^ df] : but it ’s not end − t o − end qualit y of service .
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : It is only um [ pause] what t he gat eways get .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s] : And wit hin t he core net work [ pause] t here are cert ain kind
of t unnels set up in t he core net work it self of t he access provider ,
m n082 [ s^ e] : not t he int ernet backbone core .
m n082 [ s] : And y ou use cert ain kind of t unnel m echanism [ pause] t o
com bine , in principle , t he base st at ion clust er cont rol .
m n082 [ s] : But t his is [ disfm arker] uh is cont rolled by a cert ain kind of
[ pause] node .
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : And you have t he gat eway t o t he [ pause] PDN , or t he
Public Dat a Net work .
m n082 [ s] : And bet ween bot h t here ’s a cert ain kind of t unnel set up .
m n021 [ s.%−] : But in fact [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s] : But in [ disfm arker] fact now , at t he GSM level , what you
have is t hat every v oice channel y ou use provides a [ disfm arker] a p a
pret t y fine fixed uh dat a speed .
m n021 [ s] : So , we can say t hat every voice channel has an i an incr
uh [ disfm arker] im plied um [ pause] qualit y of service ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : which is nnn ninet y six hundred bit s per second .

m n021 [ s^ e] : Full duplex .
m n082 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : You m ean now for GSM , @ @ ,
m n021 [ qy ^ g^ rt ] : Doesn’t it ?
m n082 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ fh] : So .
m n082 [ s] : Yeah , what is [ disfm arker] what m eans qualit y of service .
m n082 [ s] : A cert ain degree .
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n082 [ fh] : Uh .
m n082 [ s.%−] : Som et im es we have som e [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ fg|s^ arp] : No , but [ disfm arker] um but not only because of
[ disfm arker] of dat a speed ,
m n021 [ s] : but also about delay ,
m n021 [ fh] : you know ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : because GSM net works were developed t o y uh [ pause]
wit h a voice serv ice in m ind .
m n021 [ fh|s] : Ah , delay is also [ pause] considered in t hese net works
.
m n021 [ fh] : So ,
m n021 [ fh|s] : uh , in fact for every voice channel you have uh a pret t y
fine m ax im um uh delay and jit t er , and a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a
specified um dat a speed .
m n021 [ s] : So y ou can scale up [ disfm arker] scale up t his uh t his um
t hing by using several channels .
m n021 [ s] : So , in fact , you have , using just GSM t echnology , you
have m ore or less t he sam e building blocks as you can get uh wit h t he
UMTS .
m n021 [ s] : I m ean t hat one t hing is t hat t he t echnology is a lit t le bit
different ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : t hat uh t he base st at ion t hing is different
m n021 [ s^ am ] : and m aybe uh t he [ disfm arker] t he int ernal rout ing uh
inside t he net work is different
m n021 [ s^ no.%−] : but from t he point of view of t he m obile t hings uh I
’m not sure if [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : It ’s packaged dat a orient ed .
m n082 [ s] : It ’s not really circuit − swit ched .
m n082 [ s] : In UMTS you have always GPS as a [ disfm arker] a
inv olv em ent in t he core net work .
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : You have , in principle , t he pat h which st ill is available
for [ disfm arker] for t he GSM net work .
m n082 [ s] : Also t hey use , in principle , t he sam e uh t he sam e
m echanism .

m n021 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : But y ou also have a [ disfm arker] dat uh packet orient ed
com m unicat ion t hat ’s on t he GPS st uff .
m n082 [ s] : And t hat ’s also relat ed t o UMTS .
m n021 [ s^ bk|s^ nd] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker] The [ disfm arker] You
know , it is also being d uh developed , t his G uh P − DPRS t hing , GPRS
t hing .
m n082 [ fh] : So ,
m n082 [ %−] : t hat is [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ e] : which is uh pack uh packet dat a over GSM .
m n021 [ fh] : So ,
m n021 [ s] : I m ean . Uh , I don’t see t hat a [ disfm arker] a lot of
difference .
m n021 [ s] : We can expect a lot of differences f uh from t he uh m obile
t erm inal point of v iew . Uh , when uh UMTS be deployed .
m n021 [ s] : What I ’m t rying t o say is t hat [ disfm arker] is t hat
[ disfm arker] well , uh m aybe uh it is not a big problem t hat any of us
uh be uh um were um a UMTS expert
m n021 [ s^ df] : because uh I [ disfm arker] I don’t see [ disfm arker] it
[ disfm arker] I t hink t hat t he UMTS t hing is m ore a t echnology issue ,
t han a research issue .
m n021 [ s^ am ^ bd] : Maybe I ’m wrong .
m n021 [ %−−] : Just es
m n021 [ fh] : um
m n082 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : No , I t hink t here ’s a lot [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s.%−] : explaining m y [ disfm arker] m
m n082 [ fh] : Yeah . [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ ba] : I t hink t here ’s a lot of research .
m n082 [ qy ^ rt ] : But t he quest ion is " is t his uh a research wh in which
direct ion we are going ? "
m n021 [ s^ df^ ng] : I m ean [ disfm arker] t o be done here ,
m n082 [ s.%−] : And because [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s.%−] : For inf
m n021 [ s.%−−] : not [ disfm arker] not at t he [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ na] : of course , you know , [ vocalsound] I ’m [ disfm arker] I
[ disfm arker] I agree wit h you t hat t here are a lot o of t hings t o be
developed
m n021 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] But t he point is t hat [ disfm arker] uh t his
is [ pause] probably not here .
m n021 [ s^ df] : Because uh well , you know t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t he orient at ion of our group which is uh " Net works
Serv ices and Applicat ions " , not uh wireless t echnology or t he
underly ing wireless t echnology .
m n030 [ s] : You t hink m ore about hardware t echnology .
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

m n030 [ s^ bu.%−] : So , t here is a lot of hardware t o develop , but
[ pause] not [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ e] : You know , radio frequency t echnology ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : wide − band w uh CDMA .
m n021 [ s] : These kind of t hings all have a lot of t hings t o be
[ disfm arker] t o be [ disfm arker] uh researched .
m n021 [ s] : But uh I don’t t hink w t his is not som et hing we are doing
[ pause] here .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Right ,
m n082 [ s] : but bear in m ind t he pict ure is a [ disfm arker] is a lit t le bit
different .
m n082 [ s^ df] : The pict ure I hav e in m ind concerning UMTS is , first of
all , if you use UMTS only for voice , Like you did it or are doing now for
GSM , it ’s not wort h t o have t his kind of net work .
m n082 [ s] : And , [ pause] current ly in Europe , where it will be
deploy ed first , I believe , it will be very hard , in principle , t o get som e
m oney back if you have only for [ disfm arker] using it for voice .
m n021 [ s^ 2] : Voice ,
m n021 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
m n082 [ s^ df] : Because t hey paid a lot of m oney .
m n082 [ fh] : So .
m n082 [ qw^ rt ] : What is t he point ?
m n082 [ s] : The point is t hat you use t he UMTS t o connect t o t he
int ernet and hav e cert ain kind of services which are st ill not av ailable
up t o now .
m n082 [ s] : But t he problem is if you have t he int ernet cont ent , and
y ou hav e m ay be y our sm all uh um [ pause] dev ice of m aybe only
ev olut ion based for [ disfm arker] for t hese uh new t echnologies , for
[ disfm arker] for [ disfm arker] cert ain m obile phones , t hen you have
cert ain kind of problem s ,
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : you know ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : because you cannot use t hese t hings .
m n082 [ s] : And WAP is not an answer for [ disfm arker] for t hese kind of
t hings ,
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : you know .
m n082 [ fh] : So .
m n082 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] I believe t here is a lot of research work
m n082 [ s] : and also if you see t he end − t o − end scope of t he int ernet
, from t he m obile node up t o t he cert ain kind of server , "
correspondent node " , or what ever you call t his [ pause] dest inat ion ,
t hen you hav e cert ain kind of m odels , for inst ance , for t he qualit y of
serv ice and all t hese kind of t hings .
m n082 [ s] : And t hen is UMTS only one link where you have cert ain kind
of subnet lay er t echnology .
m n082 [ s] : And y ou have t o m at ch t hese t hings anyway .

m n082 [ s] : It ’s like a [ pause] norm al et hernet .
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : What ever you see , it is only an addit ional subnet layer
t echnology .
m n021 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s] : And you have all t he t hings m apped t o t he [ disfm arker] uh
t o [ disfm arker] t o t he [ disfm arker] t o t he [ disfm arker] t he int ernet
st uff , in principle , t o t his t echnology .
m n082 [ s] : And furt herm ore , y ou see t hat t he t rend is t o put m ore IP
t echnology , really , really IP t echnology , and not cert ain kind of
m odificat ions and adapt at ions , t o t heir access net work it self .
m n082 [ fh] : And
m n082 [ s^ ba] : t h t here ’s a lot of pot ent ial , as I believe , for
[ disfm arker] for uh cert ain research work .
m n082 [ qy^ rt ] : But t he quest ion is , first of all , " Do we have t he
com pet ence t o do som et hing like t hat ? "
m n082 [ s^ e] : First of all .
m n082 [ s] : Second , we are not hardware builders , in t hat sense t o
set up cert ain kind of end syst em s .
m n082 [ s] : We can design t hem , yeah , from t he prot ocol layering
m n082 [ s^ am ] : and [ disfm arker] and m ay be have som e sim ulat ions ,
or what ever .
m n082 [ qy^ rt ] : But isn’t t he final out com e really such a device ?
m n082 [ s^ e] : Prot ot ype , Linux based .
m n082 [ s] : And we go around here and we have m aybe a GPS − base
st at ion sponsored by Ericsson ,
m n082 [ s^ e] : since t hey are living not so far away
m n082 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and m ay be WaveLAN connect ion , here
m n082 [ s] : now a t est bed
m n082 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : and t hen [ disfm arker] t hen figure out t hat it works
?
m n082 [ s] : So , t hat ’s m y point .
m n081 [ s] : Well , just t o m ake t he list a lit t le bit longer .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m n081 [ %−−] : May
m n081 [ fh|s^ cs] : Um , you could also t hink about uh session

m n081 [ s^ df] : I do along wit h uh t he net work applicat ions and

m n081 [ s.%−−] : It ’s a [ disfm arker] a

m n081 [ s] : But se session m anagem ent , I m ean uh t he
aut hent icat ion , if you go from one net work t o t he ot her , it ’s not
solv ed .
m n081 [ fh] : uh ,

m n081 [ s^ df] : Nobody really want s a [ disfm arker] a guest on your
net work .
m n081 [ s^ e] : Unless you get som e m oney t hrough som e way
[ disfm arker] uh t hrough som e way .
m n081 [ s] : Then , t here is also t he session m anagem ent in t he sense
t hat a lot of t hese t hings [ disfm arker] at t he Barwan project , as you
said , go t hrough proxies .
m n081 [ s] : There m ight be kind of handoffs at [ disfm arker] uh at
prox ies ,
m n081 [ s^ e] : like t he zip uh [ disfm arker] s zip prox y t hat we [ pause]
also discussed before a lit t le bit .
m n081 [ s] : That [ disfm arker] t hat ’s als I t hink also in t he line of uh
session m anagem ent .
m n081 [ s] : Then t here is t his uh perfect t hing uh t he Berkeley socket s
.
m n081 [ s^ ba] : It ’s alm ost perfect .
m n081 [ s] : They s kind of skipped uh lay er five , uh session
m anagem ent or session layer , I t hink .
m n081 [ s^ df] : That ’s um [ pause] norm ally wit h [ disfm arker] if you do
a socket program m ing , it ’s direct ly t he prot applicat ion prot ocol on
lay er four , uh TCP socket , or layer five for UDP socket .
m n081 [ s.%−−] : There m ight also be som e research [ disfm arker]
m n081 [ fh] : Well ,
m n081 [ qy] : could you int roduce such a session m anagem ent ,
m n081 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker]
m n081 [ s] : Norm − what t hey do right now is t hey m ake it part of t he
applicat ion − lev el prot ocol .
m n081 [ s] : That ’s what t hey do m ost oft en .
m n081 [ s^ e] : Like wit h session m anagem ent ? for m obile t he
[ disfm arker] uh applicat ions such as ist inst ant m essaging or uh t alks ,
and so on , uh like zip . It ’s just doing a [ disfm arker] a reconnect .
m n081 [ s^ e] : If t hey t hink t hat t he net work is different or different
capabilit ies com e int o play , t hey sim ply do a reconnect
m n081 [ s] : so it ’s part of t he prot ocol .
m n081 [ s] : That ’s all what I t hink about session m anagem ent ,
m n081 [ s^ e] : like part of [ disfm arker] in proxies or is it en em bedded
in applicat ion lev el prot ocols ?
m n082 [ s^ bu] : But it ’s really higher level .
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m n082 [ s] : It ’s no m ore relat ed t o a net work .
m n081 [ %−] : I it ’s [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : We are leaving t he net work area .
m n082 [ s^ ba] : That ’s dangerous .
m n081 [ s] : So how do you want t o focus on net work services .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : Cuz if you go t o t he app
m n082 [ %−−] : If y ou [ disfm arker]

m n082 [ s] : For m e t hat ’s st art ing wit h m iddleware aspect s ,
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : you know ?
m n081 [ %−−] : Well t he
m n082 [ %] : And [ disfm arker]
m n081 [ s] : So " net work applicat ions " , if you look at t he nam e of
[ pause] t he group , one t hing is t hat um t he t hey used t o call a
[ disfm arker] a n a " net work " t hat was uh [ disfm arker] if it was like
dist ribut ed bet ween t wo syst em s connect ed by a net work .
m n081 [ s] : If you look at " net work " from t he OZ layer , t hen it ’s uh ,
lev el t wo or som et hing or [ pause] m ay be level t hree , but everyt hing
below [ pause] t hree .
m n081 [ s] : So t here are , I t hink , t wo [ disfm arker] t wo different
int erpret at ions of uh " net work " .
m n082 [ s] : No , I believe " net work " is , if you see it really from
[ disfm arker] from t he IP prot ocol suit e , is t hen layer one , in principle ,
up t including layer four ,
m n082 [ s^ e] : despit e t he fact t hat layer four is only residing ,
norm ally , in t he end syst em and in t he gat eways .
m n081 [ qy ] : But are t here " net work applicat ions " , t hen ?
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n081 [ s] : So , t he [ disfm arker] t he nam e is " Net work Services and
Applicat ions " ,
m n081 [ qw] : s so what could be an en exam ple of a net work
applicat ion if you look at t he OZ st ick ?
m n082 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , we have , I t hink , som e .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ qh^ rt ] : Do you see t his word " applicat ion " relat ed t o a

m n082 [ qh] : Or do y ou see t his word independent ly ?
m n082 [ s] : That was never discussed in det ail .
m n082 [ s] : " Net work [ pause] Services [ pause] and [ pause]

m n082 [ s] : So , ev eryt hing in t he world .
m n081 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ qh] : Or is t he applicat ion relat ed t o t he net work ?
m n082 [ s] : For m y underst anding and as far as we discussed , so
[ disfm arker] such a long t im e uh , t hese applicat ions should
[ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ e] : For inst ance , e − com m erce .
m n081 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , OK , well , t hey will [ disfm arker] I didn’t want t o

m n082 [ s.%−] : And it ’s really , really
m n082 [ fh] : y eah
m n082 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : You know ?
m n082 [ %−−] : That [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .

m n082 [ s^ ar|s] : No no , uh t hat is a t ypical applicat ion , I t hink ,
m n082 [ s] : which is , in principle , also a lit t le bit relat ed t o
[ disfm arker] uh t o t he net work .
m n082 [ s^ e] : But not any applicat ion .
m n082 [ s] : And we also have t he aspect s for securit y .
m n082 [ s] : Miguel , you m ent ioned here aut hent icat ion and
[ disfm arker] and t riple − A ,
m n082 [ s] : but we do not have any ex pert anym ore .
m n082 [ s^ df] : Because Hannes was an expert for t hat .
m n082 [ s] : So t he [ pause] problem for m e , it st ill exist s t hat we have ,
in principle , here [ pause] basic building blocks in t he proposal from
t he net working side .
m n082 [ s] : We could have a cert ain kind of applicat ion
m n082 [ s] : and t here ’s a lot of act ivit ies in t he out side world
m n082 [ s] : and I believe t here ’s a lot of cont act s .
m n082 [ s] : Or t here could be a lot of cont act s uh wit h [ disfm arker]
wit h t hese people .
m n082 [ s^ e] : Especially at uh Georgia Tech .
m n082 [ s] : I know on [ disfm arker] nex t week on Tuesday .
m n082 [ s^ r|s^ f] : Tuesday , right ?
m n082 [ s] : We will go t o UCB .
m n082 [ s] : There are t hree guys .
m n082 [ s] : Then Morgan m ent ioned one .
m n082 [ s^ bd^ no] : I do not know exact ly um uh what he is doing ,
m n082 [ s] : but , he ’s also int erest ing in som e kind of collaborat ion .
m n082 [ s] : He ’s also a professor in t he UCB .
m n082 [ s] : And uh m any univ ersit ies
m n082 [ s] : m ay be [ pause] Claudia m ent ioned Duisburg .
m n082 [ s] : And uh [ disfm arker] in principle , m ost of t he universit y
have som e act ivit ies in t hat area .
m n082 [ s] : We will not t ake care about t hese one ,
m n082 [ s] : but we can use t hem as um [ pause] for field ex uh field

m n082 [ s^ e] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and m aybe som e

m n082 [ s^ e] : and [ disfm arker] and what ever kind of t hing .
m n082 [ s] : And we focus really on t he net working st uff
m n082 [ s] : and going in m ore det ail in t his area .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : And t he alt ernat ive is m ay be what uh
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : current ly we have only uh t his uh proposal from Wilbert
t o go m ore in t he sm aller scope .
m n082 [ s] : Figure out som e pot ent ial from m aybe t his uh WaveLAN

m n082 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and st art ing from t hat .
m n082 [ qo] : Or , are t here ot her suggest ions ?

m n030 [ s^ df] : I t hink we uh have already so m uch work put int o t his

m n030 [ qh^ ng] : why t o swit ch now ?
m n030 [ s] : So I don’t see t he reason for t hat .
m n030 [ s] : May be t he applicat ion we suggest ed is not t he best one .
m n030 [ s] : So we have t o t hink about an applicat ion which
[ disfm arker] which is um um , for m obile users , m ore relev ant .
m n030 [ s^ bd^ no] : I don’t know .
m n030 [ s^ cs] : May be video gam es .
m n030 [ s^ df.%−−] : If you are t raveling
m n030 [ s] : uh , it ’s boring t o t rav el
m n030 [ s] : and t hen you decide t o play a g video gam e wit h
som ebody else who ’s t raveling .
m n082 [ s^ bk|s^ bd] : Yeah , you know , it ’s st ill m ent ioned in t he
proposal .
m n030 [ fh] : So .
m n082 [ fh] : And
m n082 [ %−−] : t h um
m n082 [ s^ bd] : I [ disfm arker] I ’m sure , OK , t hat it is t he wrong place
t o [ pause] get t he foundat ion why we are use t his kind of applicat ion ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : but uh [ disfm arker] And [ disfm arker] In [ disfm arker] in
t he end of t he t ext [ disfm arker] in t he end of t he pr t ext of t he

m n082 [ s^ df] : But it is m ent ioned t hat it is only an exam ple .
m n082 [ s] : And t hat we use t his applicat ion , in principle , while it is
t hen very v ery easy t o get a cert ain kind of access t o t hese kind of

m n082 [ s] : When you have a video gam e server and [ disfm arker] and
y ou want t o have m obile access you m ust at least have one in your

m n082 [ s] : And t hen we [ disfm arker] we are playing videos , in

m n082 [ s] : And t hat is , I t hink , m uch m ore harder t han t o have a

m n082 [ s] : and uh t o t his server , which is run on t he cam pus of t he
Univ ersit y .
m n030 [ s^ bk|s^ na] : OK , t hat ’s right .
m n082 [ s] : And t hat is t he point .
m n082 [ s] : You can have t his f t o figure out all t he t hings
m n082 [ fh] : and t he [ disfm arker] t he um
m n082 [ fh] : and t he [ disfm arker] t he um
m n082 [ s] : um , now , how t o say , t he requirem ent s of t his
applicat ion using t his classroom scenario .
m n082 [ s] : But nevert heless , it ’s not t he best for
m n082 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and
uh

m n082 [ s] : s net working st uff .
m n082 [ s] : You are right .
m n082 [ qy] : But it [ disfm arker] Does any body see cert ain kind of

m n082 [ s^ e] : and t o st art t he work m aybe in t his lit t le bit sm aller oh
uh scope based on t hese building blocks ?
m n082 [ s^ df] : Because Mult icast you st ill m ent io uh you m ent ioned
t hat t here is no pot ent ial .
m n082 [ s] : I t hink it ’s described here t hat t he pot ent ial , if you use it
for t he m apping t o t he next generat ion net works in t he wireless

m n082 [ s^ df] : because t hey [ pause] do not use it .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : And t o figure out whet her t hey ’re useful inse inst ead
of using cert ain kind of t unneling m echanism and t o set up t hese
t unnels
m n082 [ s.%−−] : and have t he m apping bet ween a PSDN uh t elephone
num ber or what ev er kind of num ber t hey are using t o IP addresses
and t hen t here ’s t he t unnel I Ds ,
m n082 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and all t his kind of t hings , I t hink , is very

m n082 [ s^ e] : as well as for ISP ’s .
m n082 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink t he pot ent ial is st ill t here .
m n082 [ s] : You [ disfm arker] you neglect ed t hat ,
m n082 [ s] : but I don’t t hink t hat you are right in t hat sense .
m n081 [ s^ aap] : Well , t hink it works ,
m n081 [ %−−] : but uh
m n081 [ s^ aa|s] : yes , t he m apping of course bet ween m ult icast ing
and t he UMTS or [ disfm arker] or what ever
m n082 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : In next generat ion ?
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n081 [ s^ rt ] : That ’s [ disfm arker] or CDMA or what ever [ disfm arker]
t hat ’s uh , yeah , probably a t hing t hat has t o be find out .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n081 [ s^ no] : I don’t know what st at uses .
m n081 [ s^ am ] : Maybe t hey already did it par as part of UMTS ,
m n081 [ s^ no] : I ’m not sure .
m n081 [ s^ no] : I don’t have a clue .
m n081 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I only know how it works on copper and like

m n081 [ s] : and on PS PPP over som et hing
m n081 [ s] : and how it works like t hat ,
m n081 [ s^ no] : but on t he wireless I ’m not sure .
m n082 [ qw.%−−] : Now what do you see about t he
m n082 [ fh] : um , um ,
m n082 [ s^ e] : KPN int erest s ?

m n082 [ s^ df] : Because , I believ e s if t he argum ent changes as

Mult icast st uff , and KPN is very int erest ing in UMTS st uff , and t his is
one pot ent ial t arget net work environm ent we are focusing on , but
only for t he uh IP − layer t echnology , t hen , why do [ disfm arker] t he

m n082 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m n021 [ s] : One quest ion .
m n081 [ s^ aap|s.%−−] : Yes , but if [ disfm arker] if it ’s available
m n081 [ s.%−−] : t hat m eans
m n081 [ s^ rt ] : so [ disfm arker] so if uh if it ’s already part of t he UMTS
st andardizat ion t hen uh it ’s im m ediat ely finished ,
m n081 [ s^ rt ] : like , OK , you can t ell , KPN well go t o Ericsson or Nokia
and buy it ?
m n081 [ s] : And if it ’s not in t here yet well , it could be a suggest ion
m n081 [ s] : and t hen t he hardware people will m ake it part u like t he
ETSI or what ever [ disfm arker] where U [ disfm arker] wherever UMTS is

m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n081 [ s] : Of course , yeah , t his [ disfm arker] t his group could do
t hat , t oo .
m n081 [ s] : Could be ,
m n081 [ fh] : but
m n021 [ s] : I have a [ disfm arker] an im port ant doubt about t he IP
av ailabilit y ov er UMTS .
m n021 [ s] : I m ean [ disfm arker] you know t hat t he carriers and som e
m anufact urers have done an im port ant effort in developing t his web
t hing
m n021 [ fh|s^ no] : and uh I ’m not sure what t hey plan t o do wit h next

m n021 [ qh] : I m ean , are t hey [ pause] m aint aining [ disfm arker] are
t hey holding t he sam e web t echnology ?
m n021 [ qrr] : Or , are ju just t hey [ disfm arker] discarding t his

m n021 [ s^ e] : and forget t ing about t he t hing ?
m n021 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know what will happen .
m n021 [ s^ no] : uh , I [ disfm arker] I don’t have a clue .
m n021 [ s] : Probably , if aft er searching a lit t le bit on t he [ disfm arker]
on t he net I can get t he answer ,
m n021 [ s] : but init ially t his is som et hing t o [ disfm arker] t o
[ disfm arker] t o have in m ind .
m n021 [ s^ df] : I m ean . Because m ay be t his UMTS t hing will appear on
t he m arket wit hout IP as a nat ive prot ocol .
m n021 [ s] : And if t his is t he case well , t hus seam less int egrat ion
could be we st rongly affect ed .

m n021 [ s] : At least , uh , if you [ disfm arker] we want t o use U M
m n021 [ s^ bd^ df] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m [ disfm arker] just uh t hrowing
t he quest ion .
m n021 [ s] : uh I m ean , looking for an answer
m n021 [ s^ no] : because I don’t know if uh som e of you have a clue
about t his .
m n021 [ s^ e^ no] : I don’t know what [ disfm arker] what carriers are
planning t o do about t his .
m n081 [ s^ no] : I ’m not really sure ,
m n081 [ s] : but I t hought I [ disfm arker] I had t he im pression t hat we
can t hrow away our Nokia st uff when [ disfm arker] our web gat eway s ,
when we g ev en go t o GPRS ,
m n081 [ fh] : so
m n081 [ s] : let alone UMTS .
m n082 [ s] : Now , WAP is ja not only relat ed now t o available bandwidt h
.
m n081 [ s] : That ’s t he im pression I get .
m n082 [ s] : That ’s not t he only t hing .
m n082 [ s] : It ’s only t he adapt at ion t owards t he capabilit ies of t he

m n082 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m n081 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , definit ely .
m n082 [ fh] : So .
m n082 [ s.%−] : uh [ disfm arker] I never was a friend [ disfm arker]
m n081 [ s.%−−] : But [ pause] but st ill a le d it ’s a [ disfm arker] it ’s a
fundam ent al
m n082 [ b.%] : Huh .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n081 [ s.%−−] : uh it ’s a [ disfm arker] part of a [ disfm arker] of design
like t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker]
m n081 [ s] : t he t erm inal has a WAP st ick .
m n081 [ s] : And t here ’s a box t hat has also a [ disfm arker] a WAP st ick
.
m n082 [ b.%] : So [ pause] yeah .
m n081 [ s] : And t hey do som et im e [ disfm arker] m ost cases , t hey do
share an IP address .
m n081 [ s] : But doesn’t uh have t o deal wit h IP at all .
m n081 [ s] : It ’s l just a t hirt y − bit num ber
m n021 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n081 [ s] : t hat a act ually is an assigned num ber .
m n081 [ s] : But it ’s all only used for ident ificat ion .
m n081 [ s] : That ’s t he only t hing .
m n081 [ s] : It ’s st ored in a WAP cookie ,
m n081 [ s] : m uch like HTP
m n081 [ s.%−−] : in a cookie and from t he WAP gat eway

m n081 [ s] : t hen it will be HTP [ disfm arker] real HTP [ disfm arker] or
som et hing .
m n081 [ s] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s really a different uh t ype of

m n081 [ s] : It looks a lit t le bit like uh t he [ disfm arker] t he well , WML
looks a lit t le bit like HTML ,
m n081 [ s.%−−] : but t hat ’s all what ’s uh [ disfm arker]
m n081 [ s] : It ’s not IP at all .
m n082 [ b] : Right .
m n081 [ s] : Because t here is a gat eway , you can access wit h alm ost
t he sam e m icrobrowser ,
m n081 [ s^ e] : t he sam e i uh web servers .
m n081 [ s] : If t hey provide t he right cont ent [ disfm arker] uh , spit out
t he right uh WML language .
m n081 [ s] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s really a different net work
[ disfm arker] t echnology [ disfm arker] I t hink .
m n082 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s] : It ’s t ransparent , in principle , what you can carry ,
m n082 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : Any way , you have t he gat eway .
m n082 [ s] : It m ust be uh [ pause] The ca uh c uh t conversion of t he

m n081 [ b] : Yeah .
m n081 [ %−] : But @ @

m n082 [ s.%−−] : But , I don’t see t hat uh [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ ba] : It ’s t oo lat e , I believe .
m n082 [ s] : If WAP was available in t he beginning of GSM , t hen I t hink
it was t here would be a good chance t hat it is well − deployed .
m n021 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : But now , t he first generat ion of web − browsers are in t he

m n081 [ %−] : I i
m n082 [ s] : so t hat ’s wrong [ vocalsound] [ disfm arker] in t he m obile

m n082 [ s] : but t he [ disfm arker] t he nex t generat ion of net works are

m n082 [ s^ rt ] : and t he ba uh t he bandwidt h const raint s are no m ore

m n081 [ fg] : Well [ disfm arker]

m n081 [ s^ bu] : Bu − [ pause] well , you don’t have a m obile phone in
[ disfm arker] in t he USA here .
m n021 [ s^ aa] : No .
m n021 [ s^ aa^ r] : No .
m n081 [ s] : So t hat ’s m aybe t he reason .
m n021 [ s^ na] : Not m e .
m n081 [ s] : And I ’m not [ disfm arker] I doubt t hat it ’s not available in

m n081 [ s] : It ’s [ disfm arker] would be unbeliev able t o m e .
m n082 [ qy ^ rt ] : Now , do you [ disfm arker] yeah , do you see t he
chance for WAP ?
m n082 [ s] : I don’t see it .
m n081 [ s^ na] : It i it is .
m n081 [ s^ df] : In [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in Sweden it is also t here
.
m n081 [ s^ df^ e] : And in t he Net herlands , it is also available .
m n021 [ b] : Mm m .
m n081 [ s.%−] : every provider provides [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ aap] : In Spain it ’s available
m n021 [ s^ bd^ df] : but uh you know , uh m y m ain com plaint has been
all t he t im e t hat it is difficult t o m e t o believe t hat I can do int erest ing

m n021 [ s^ cs] : Ah [ pause] Maybe , check t he lot t ery result

m n081 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n081 [ s^ bk|%−] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker]
m n081 [ s^ fe] : Oh !
m n081 [ %−] : Bu
m n081 [ s^ df] : I ’m t he first one t o adm it t hat ’s a h t hat it is a hype ,

m n081 [ s^ df^ rt ] : but [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] but I ’m
[ disfm arker] I just want ed t o say it is being used .
m n081 [ s] : But if it m akes sense t o m e and t o [ disfm arker] especially
t o hav e WAP in [ disfm arker] in bet ween , no .
m n081 [ s] : I ’m not a support er of it .
m n021 [ b] : Huh − huh − huh .
m n081 [ s] : So t hey have t his opt im ized prot ocol t o [ disfm arker] t o
t ransm it a few ASCII byt es t hat can [ pause] rescr refresh t he screen
wit h a different anim at ion [ pause] every , well , second , a few t im es .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n081 [ s^ na] : So , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t rue .
m n081 [ s] : I im m ediat ely agree .
m n081 [ s^ df] : But t he t hing was , y you just asked well , " will
[ disfm arker] will it be t he sam e , will t here be WAP for UMTS " and so on
, QPRS .
m n021 [ %−] : Well
m n081 [ s^ no] : And [ disfm arker] well [ disfm arker] I don’t have t he

m n021 [ s^ no.%−] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know what will [ disfm arker]
m n081 [ s] : but I t hought it was not .
m n081 [ s] : I ’m just [ disfm arker] It ’s weird [ disfm arker] it ’s weird t o
st op doing it wit h GPRS .
m n035 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .
m n035 [ s^ df] : But usually WAP shouldn’t [ disfm arker] is so general
t hat it can be used wit h UMTS .

m ight be able t o do it .
m n035 [ %−] : But
m n081 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m n035 [ s.%−] : t hat shouldn’t be your only way of [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : There ’s a gat e You can put t he gat eway [ disfm arker]
m n081 [ s] : if you want t o do it in a [ disfm arker] in a m obile phone

m n081 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Yes ?

m n035 [ s] : But usually [ disfm arker] t hat ’s not t he reason t o have
UMTS .
m n081 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : No , not [ disfm arker] not if you have a big uh

m n035 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m n081 [ s] : Then y ou m There [ disfm arker] t here ’s an IP st ack in it

m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n081 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s^ t ^ t c.%−−] : So m aybe I would like t o ask Claudia ,
m n081 [ b] : Hm m .
m n082 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : you read t he proposal in t he m eant im e ?
fn083 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , but t he t ask changed really a lot ,
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fn083 [ s.%−] : so , I ’d [ disfm arker] I rat her would like t o
m n082 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yes , t hat ’s right .
m n082 [ qy] : And do you have som e com m ent s on it
m n082 [ s^ e|s^ bk] : from t he next [ disfm arker] t his is version zero dot

fn083 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , but I ’d rat her like t o follow t he discussion
before I gave any com m ent s ,
fn083 [ s^ df] : cuz it ’s really The first point is it ’s m uch m ore t han it
was before I left ,
fn083 [ s:s^ fe] : so it ’s like five weeks in bet ween , so it ’s like t hat
whew !
fn083 [ s] : t hat big now .
m n082 [ s^ na] : That ’s right .
fn083 [ s] : And it really changed a lot
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
fn083 [ s^ df] : cuz t he [ disfm arker] I m ean I found t he classroom inside
fn083 [ s] : but , t he t hing where I left t he discussion was t hat we are
t alking about uh a classroom where you know everybody could look on
wit h any kind of dev ice and follow lect ures or do exercise or what ever .
fn083 [ fh] : So .
fn083 [ s] : Now we are t alking about som et hing which is m uch m ore
precise
fn083 [ s] : and t he [ disfm arker] t he range of st uff is m aybe m ore
[ pause] narrow t han before
fn083 [ s] : so I ’d rat her like t o [ disfm arker] t o follow it a bit , and t hen
t o get m ore int o [ pause] t he ideas .
m n081 [ %−] : So
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n081 [ qy .%−−] : c Can I [ pause] do anot her one , like
m n081 [ s^ t c] : UMTS or wireless [ pause] u i generally are [ disfm arker]
will be m m ore expensive .
m n081 [ s^ e] : And especially UMTS .
m n081 [ s] : If t hey want t o get back t he m oney .
m n081 [ s^ cs.%−−] : So is it m aybe a research t opic t o focus on t he
[ disfm arker]
m n081 [ s] : not really billing , of course .
m n081 [ s.%−−] : I wouldn’t [ disfm arker]

m n081 [ s] : but at least t he different applicat ion of prot ocol − based
usage .
m n081 [ s^ rt ] : So y ou have uh one connect ion , one applicat ion uses
FTP what ever ,
m n081 [ s.%−−] : bit voice or som e ot her [ disfm arker]
m n081 [ s^ cs] : That [ disfm arker] t hose t ype of applicat ion you m m ay
[ disfm arker] m ight want t o [ pause] m ake m ore out of a m egabit per

m n081 [ qy^ rt ] : Could t hat be som et hing ,
m n081 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m n082 [ s|qy^ d^ g] : Also we want t o go m ore in t he t riple − A area .
Right ?
m n082 [ s^ df.%−−] : Because billing [ pause] alone
m n081 [ %−] : Or is n
m n081 [ s^ ar|s.%−] : No [ disfm arker] Well , it ’s [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : Or [ pause] or ac um Billing is relat ed t o account ing ,
m n081 [ %−] : e
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : Account ing is relat ed t o [ pause] Aut hent ificat ion and
Aut horizat ion .
m n081 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , t hat ’s t rue .
m n082 [ fh] : So .
m n082 [ s] : And t hen you are st ill at t he t riple − A service uh act ivit y
m n081 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , t hat ’s right .
m n082 [ s] : and nobody is [ disfm arker] has t he skills t o deal wit h t hat .
m n082 [ s] : And t hen we are leaving our scope anyway .
m n081 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n035 [ s] : My im pression on t his proposal is t hat every single block
[ pause] has som e [ pause] research done already .
m n035 [ s] : So , m ult icast . This m eans t hat t here are m any t hings
done .
m n035 [ qw^ t 1] : Oh , what was it ?
m n035 [ s] : May be I was rout ing m obilit y m anagem ent
m n035 [ s] : But no one act ually put t hem [ pause] t oget her .
m n082 [ s^ aa|%−] : Yeah . That ’s [ disfm arker]
m n035 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] So t hat ’s t he big problem .
m n082 [ s.%−] : That is a [ disfm arker]
m n035 [ s] : But t he problem wit h t his problem , m ight be t hat it ’s t oo
[ pause] big
m n035 [ s^ e.%−] : t o put all t hese big pieces t o
fn083 [ qw] : What do you m ean by " put t oget her " ?
m n035 [ s] : So t hat you really hav e a com plet e [ disfm arker] a com plet e
scenario .
m n082 [ s|qy^ d^ g] : As it [ disfm arker] What I m ean , t he synergy effect
, right ?
m n082 [ %−] : From [ disfm arker] from [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .

m n035 [ s] : You hav e , in one scenario , m ult icast , [ pause] qualit y of

m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
fn083 [ b] : Ah .
fn083 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n035 [ s] : Not just [ pause] t he islands alone .
m n082 [ %−] : Yeah . I
fn083 [ s.%−−] : So why I wasn’t ,
fn083 [ s^ rt ] : well , yeah , uh hold m yself back a bit wit h com m ent s , is
uh cuz when I left t he discussion , t he discussion was what t o
[ disfm arker] t o have som et hing like a big um brella about everybody
[ pause] who was at t his point , here .
fn083 [ s] : And so t he discussion was m uch broader t han it is m aybe
right now .
fn083 [ s^ bu] : And t here I had t he im pression t he um brella was t his
kind of classroom [ pause] t hing .
fn083 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
fn083 [ qrr^ d] : Or [ pause] wrong ?
m n082 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , in principle , it is relat ed t o t he current st at e .
m n082 [ s] : But t he net working st uff is m ore explained in m uch m ore
det ail
fn083 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , yeah , yeah . It is .
fn083 [ s^ e] : Of course .
m n082 [ s] : and t he work packages are bet t er ident oder what c could
be deriv ed for work packages is m uch bet t er aligned .
fn083 [ b] : Yeah .
fn083 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
fn083 [ s^ na] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s clear .
m n082 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : But t hat has not changed , yeah ?
fn083 [ %−] : But
fn083 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s clear ,
fn083 [ s.%−−] : but t hen I don’t get [ disfm arker]
fn083 [ s^ df] : because when we were discussion [ disfm arker]
discussing t his uh st uff weeks ago , uh I had t he im pression t hat , you
know , everyt hing of t hese work packages [ pause] uh fit t oget her
under t his one big um brella .
fn083 [ s] : And now it sounds different .
fn083 [ s^ no] : So t hat ’s what I don’t underst and .
fn083 [ s^ df] : Ah but , it ’s also because I m issed [ pause] t he last four
weeks .
fn083 [ fh] : So .
m n082 [ fg|s.%−] : Yeah , t he problem is if you [ disfm arker]
fn083 [ s] : It ’s a [ disfm arker] a bit hard for m e t o follow t he
developm ent what happened in t he last four weeks ,
m n082 [ fg|s] : Yeah OK m aybe one sent ence [ disfm arker] one
sent ence .

fn083 [ s^ e] : why it changed so .
m n082 [ s] : If you ’re [ pause] focussing on t he argum ent chain as
follows . I hav e an applicat ion .
m n082 [ s] : This applicat ion has cert ain kind of requirem ent s .
m n082 [ s] : These requirem ent s are , m ay be , Mult icast and
[ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and qualit y of service and m obilit y
m n082 [ s^ e] : access and t hen m obilit y m anagem ent
m n082 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] [ pause] That is it .
m n082 [ s] : I want t o focus on it .
m n082 [ s] : Then y ou have in m ind t hat [ disfm arker] Or you m ust have
in m ind t hat all ot her applicat ions and all ot her net working st uff is not
affect ed by t his .
m n082 [ s] : That y ou can use it wit h every applicat ion
m n082 [ s] : and if you int roduce som e new m echanism in t he net work ,
t hat is not relat ed only t o int eract ive m ult im edia applicat ions like t he
classroom , it m ust be fit end t o end .
m n082 [ s] : And if y ou assum e som et hing , like we discussed it , very
hard wit h [ disfm arker] wit h Mult icast , t hat you assum e t hat Mult icast
will be av ailable [ pause] at cert ain port ions of t he net work or [ pause] if
y ou [ disfm arker] if you want t o have it end t o end , t his m echanism
m ust be applied really for [ disfm arker] all t hroughout of t he int ernet .
m n082 [ s] : Ot herwise it m akes no sense ,
m n082 [ s:s] : and we com e t o t he conclusion , " OK , uh Mult icast , we
m ust deal wit h bot h approaches " ,
m n082 [ s] : t hat you have eh applicat ion layer Mult icast
m n082 [ s.%] : as well as m aybe som e ot her Mult icast and m aybe really
Mult icast
m n082 [ s] : and t hen t he point is how t o select t hese m echanism if
y ou want t o have not a cert ain kind of access t o t he server elsewhere
in t he net work y ou want t o use any applicat ion .
fn083 [ s.%−−] : So if I underst andi it right , what has changed is before
we were focussing on [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Yeah ,
m n082 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
fn083 [ s^ df] : So [ disfm arker] Cuz what ’s difficult for m e is what is
m eant by " applicat ion " ?
fn083 [ s^ df] : So . Cuz I have som et im es t he im pression t hat everybody
is defining " applicat ion " in different way .
fn083 [ qw] : So , what exact ly is m ean by " applicat ion " ?
m n082 [ s] : The applicat ion , for inst ance , here , t hat eh t he
int eract iv e classroom .
m n082 [ s] : But elsewhere any applicat ion in in in any kind of video
audio
fn083 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fn083 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
fn083 [ s.%−] : So , what has changed [ disfm arker]

m n082 [ s^ e] : or what ever kind of [ disfm arker] gam e server
m n082 [ s] : what − what ever kind of int eract ive m ult im edia especially
do uh downst ream ing applicat ions m aybe eh video on dem and t hen ,
eh what ev er kind of applicat ion y ou can consider .
fn083 [ s^ bu] : So what has changed is t hat we ’re not only focussing
on t his int elligent classroom , but on everyt hing .
m n082 [ s^ arp] : Not on everyt hing .
m n082 [ s^ nd] : That ’s not t rue .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : But we s
m n082 [ s] : That ’s why we say here , t hat we have a cert ain kind of eh
possibilit y t o change in t he access net works .
fn083 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : That m eans t he wireless net works
m n082 [ s^ df] : because t hat provides , in principle , t he m obilit y .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : And t hese m echan
m n082 [ s] : And you see t hat t here ’s a t rend t o provide IP funct ionalit y
m ore and m ore in t hese kind of net works .
m n082 [ s] : But t he problem is t hat y ou could not focus [ pause] on
t his kind of um t echnology only for t he access net work .
m n082 [ s] : You hav e t o have in m ind always t he end t o end scope .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : And if you see , for inst ance [ disfm arker] We have
rout ing algorit hm but different prot ocols and what ever kinds of t hings ,
u
m n082 [ s] : especially also for Mult icast ,
m n082 [ s] : different t hings really for different providers ,
m n082 [ s] : and uh and it ’s uh very easy t o change it , m aybe in t he
access net work , for novel t hings .
m n082 [ s] : For inst ance , t hat ’s one provider dom ain
m n082 [ s] : and y ou can say well why not use act ive rout ing in t hat
prov ider dom ain ?
m n082 [ s] : So it m eans t hat [ pause] packet are delivering inform at ion
,
m n082 [ s] : and y ou do not have t he separat ion of rout ing and
[ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and forwarding process .
m n082 [ s] : It ’s im possible t o deal wit h t hat in t he whole int ernet ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : because securit y reasons and what ever kinds of t hings
m ake it im possible .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : So how t o com bine t hese pos uh pot ent ial um
ex t ensions in t he um access net works , and [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : wit hout losing t he end t o end scope [ pause] in t he
int ernet .
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : Then you can have cert ain n novel feat ures
m n082 [ s] : giv e t he providers like KPN or what ever , t he po t he
pot ent ial , in principle , t o [ disfm arker] t o uh [ pause] see t he building
blocks for t he fut ure net works

m n082 [ s^ df] : because [ pause] t here ’s a t hree g t hird generat ion
like UMTS , a fourt h generat ion m ore IP relat ed .
m n082 [ s] : There will be a fift h generat ion , I ’m sure .
m n082 [ s] : And t hen you deriv e t he cert ain kind of building blocks for
t his net work ,
m n082 [ s] : if y ou ever really full I [ disfm arker] uh uh full I P , end t o
end .
m n082 [ s:s] : But nevert heless you can only [ disfm arker] not only focus
on " OK , I prov ide t his m echanism "
m n082 [ s] : because u you are accessing a cert ain kind of serv er node
in t he int ernet , using any applicat ion .
m n082 [ s] : And t hen t his m echanism m ust fit it t here .
m n082 [ s] : But nev ert heless eh int ernet backbone is in t he m eant im e
, based on it s success ,
m n082 [ s] : im possible t o change .
m n082 [ s] : You see t he difficult ies wit h IP version six ,
m n082 [ s] : eh eh y ou see t he difficult ies wit h Mult icast .
m n082 [ s] : They are discussed since , you know , t en years or
what ev er .
m n082 [ s] : The specificat ion are rat her st able and [ disfm arker] and
av ailable
m n082 [ s] : but we have only islands in t hat .
m n082 [ s] : We cannot assum e t hat ev ery t hing is end t o end available
.
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : And so you hav e t o m i t o have t o have in m ind [ pause]
t hat cert ain kinds of m echanism s are [ pause] m aybe at a cert ain
st age end t o end av ailable ,
m n082 [ s] : m ay be we have a lucky t hat [ pause] t he islands are
connect ed t o each ot her
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : or [ disfm arker] t he sam e applies for MPLS , for inst ance
,
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : m ay be t hey are only port ions available ,
m n082 [ qh] : how t o deal wit h t hat when t he islands are not available
m n082 [ s] : and m ay be not hing is available .
m n082 [ s] : But you have t o select it
m n082 [ s^ df] : because I have a m obile phone , a m obile node or
what ev er kind of device ,
m n082 [ s] : and I want t o cont act a cert ain kind of [ pause] cont ent in
t he int ernet .
m n082 [ s] : So is it possible t o d hav e cert ain kind of norm al feat ures
in t he access net work wit hout losing t he end t o end scope of
[ disfm arker] wit h t hese difficult ies we are dealing wit h .
m n082 [ s] : I always say t hat t he success of int ernet m ake it unflexible
.
m n082 [ s] : It ’s im possible t o change som et hing [ com m ent ] [ pause]
v ery easy . s

m n082 [ %−−] : s
m n082 [ s] : It ’s easy m aybe m ore on t he access net work as in t he
int ernet backbone .
m n082 [ s] : So t hat is eh overall pict ure t hat we have in m ind wit h
t hese t hings .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : And we can not u
m n082 [ s] : We [ disfm arker] we are six people
m n082 [ s^ e] : or seven or what ev er
m n082 [ s^ e] : if Hannes com e ,
m n082 [ s] : We are not able t o solve t he problem s uh in [ disfm arker] in
uh w in t he few y ears or what ever
m n082 [ s] : what t he whole int ernet com m unit y has um done in
[ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] si since [ disfm arker] uh since a decade .
m n082 [ s] : But we can f pick up som e f som e um pot ent ial and
[ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] t o st art wit h som et hing
.
m n082 [ s] : And t hat ’s m y m issing point .
m n082 [ s] : That we have here , in principle , really t he descript ion of
t his problem I m ent ioned
m n082 [ s] : and focus really on t he reasonable size of t he project
m n082 [ s] : m ay be in t he first st age fo for t he NSA [ pause] core it self ,
m n082 [ s:s] : and m aybe possible ex t ension from , for inst ance , if KPN
say " yes , t hat ’s great , "
m n082 [ s^ e:s] : " t hat ’s t he right direct ion .
m n082 [ s^ e:s] : We will support t hat . "
m n082 [ s:s] : And if Siem ens say " OK , great , we will support it " ,
m n082 [ s.%−−] : and [ disfm arker] and what [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : m m m Universit y of Berlin or som et hing
m n082 [ s] : and m ay be Universit y of Mannheim or Duisburg
m n082 [ s] : or [ pause] in Spain oder what ever .
m n082 [ s] : So if we have all t he sim ilar project t hen you have only t o
t ake care about t hat ’s [ pause] a lit t le bit aligned ,
m n082 [ s] : t hat t here ’s som e t ransparency concerning t he result s
m n082 [ s] : and and t he act ivit ies are lit erally going in t he [ disfm arker]
in t he sam e um pace .
m n082 [ s] : So t hat ’s t he basic idea .
m n082 [ s] : But really it ’s t o [ disfm arker] t o figure out cert ain kind of
sm aller act iv it ies where we can st art it .
m n082 [ s] : That ’s t he point .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : And if we get som e funding back ,
m n082 [ s.%−−] : and we have cert ain [ pause] pot ent uh pot ent ial
part ners in t he boat ,
m n082 [ s] : OK , we can go t o a broader scope of t his [ pause] whole
t hing , y eah .
m n021 [ %−] : u

m n021 [ s] : Let m e [ disfm arker] let m e propose a [ disfm arker] a
[ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a reasoning way .
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : Uh let ’s assum e t hat we are successful wit h t his
proposal ,
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : so we get t he funding t o do what ever what we want t o
do .
m n021 [ s.%−−] : So m y quest ion is , what we want t o do is ?
m n021 [ s] : Let ’s assum e t hat we have t he funding .
m n021 [ qh] : What will be our first and or [ disfm arker] or and second
st eps ?
m n021 [ qh] : Ah , what kind of t hings uh we [ disfm arker] eh we will buy
,
m n021 [ qh^ e] : what kind of t hings we will eh program or we will deploy
?
m n021 [ s^ df] : Because answering t his [ disfm arker] t hese quest ions
[ pause] we can [ pause] know m uch bet t er [ pause] what t he
applicat ion we want .
m n021 [ s.%−] : So let ’s assum e [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ fg|s^ ng] : Yeah , but t he problem is [ pause] t hat f f f funding
is t he second st ep .
m n081 [ b] : Mm m .
m n081 [ %−] : N
m n081 [ s^ ng] : Well , I ’m not sure .
m n081 [ s^ ng] : I [ disfm arker] I t h I t hink I agree wit h him .
m n081 [ s] : But uh right now we ’re looking at b a t h You want t o do a
big t hing [ pause] inst ead of a great t hing .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n081 [ s] : So if you d assum e t hat it should connect uh really good t o
Siem ens and t o uh KPN , and t o t he [ disfm arker] t hen it st art s t o get
big we should all go t o t he [ disfm arker] in t he sam e direct ion .
m n081 [ s] : If you already assum e " well , OK , t hey paid m oney " , and
now y ou t hink , OK , what [ disfm arker] what great t hing you want t o do
, t hen [ pause] it gives you m ore freedom t o t hink [ pause] about t his
great t hing y ou want t o m do .
m n082 [ fg|s^ df] : Yeah , but we have no eh [ disfm arker] current no
public funding ,
m n081 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n082 [ s^ f|s] : OK , everybody ’s paid here .
m n021 [ b] : Yeah .
m n035 [ fg|%−] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker]
m n081 [ s^ df] : But y ou [ disfm arker] but you don’t get one if you
[ disfm arker] if y ou t ry t o [ disfm arker] t o align KPN wit h Siem ens , for
inst ance .
fn083 [ b] : Yeah .
m n035 [ b] : Yeah .
m n035 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]

m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n035 [ s] : But for t heoret ical [ disfm arker] or for hist orical reasons
[ pause] a really good quest ion , " if we would hav e t he m oney what
would we do wit h t hat ? "
m n081 [ %−] : Uh .
m n035 [ s] : So if we don’t know what we would like t o do wit h t he
m oney , we probably wouldn’t get any m oney t o do what we don’t know
.
m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s^ na] : That ’s right .
m n021 [ s^ na] : Absolut ely .
m n082 [ s^ na^ r] : That ’s right .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n035 [ s] : So t hat ’s why , I t hink , yeah , it ’s a good quest ion .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : Now , t hat ’s t he point why I am focussing on
[ disfm arker] m ore on t he [ disfm arker]
m n035 [ b] : Yep .
m n082 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s] : I want t o have really t he act iv it ies
m n082 [ s^ f|qh] : you know , what is really t he out com e
m n082 [ qh] : what is really t he problem we are going t o solve .
m n082 [ s] : These are m y quest ions .
m n082 [ s] : And if we have ident ified t his block t hen it is possible t o
raise som e m oney .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n035 [ s^ na] : That ’s just t he sam e quest ion just ot her way around .
m n021 [ s] : Let [ disfm arker] let m e put an exam ple .
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : You know I [ disfm arker] Som e days ago , I bought , like
som e of y ou , t his kind of t hings .
m n021 [ s] : This is a PDA
m n021 [ s] : eh t hree com uh Palm Pilot com pat ible ,
m n035 [ s^ ba^ t 1] : Modernist ic st uff !
m n021 [ s^ ba^ bd^ rt ] : not hing [ disfm arker] not hing t hat great ,
m n035 [ s^ ba^ t 1] : Com plet ely useless !
m n021 [ s^ df] : but it has som e [ disfm arker] som e possibilit y of
[ pause] being ex panded .
m n021 [ s] : But t he point is eh , t he only [ disfm arker] in here
[ disfm arker] The only t hing [ disfm arker] wireless t hing I can put on
[ disfm arker] on t his is just uh t his Om nisky m odem ,
m n021 [ s] : which is uh , I t hink it is a subscript ion − based uh t hing .
m n021 [ s] : You hav e t o pay every [ disfm arker] every m ont h ,
m n021 [ s] : and eh of course , I cannot im agine t hat uh t om orrow I ’ll
be able t o buy a different t hing wit h four different net works ,

m n021 [ s^ e] : four different providers on it .
m n021 [ s^ bd] : May be I ’m wrong
m n021 [ %−−] : but
m n021 [ s:s] : if I hav e t he funding I say " OK , well , I can buy t his or
ev en I can buy a m obile com put er ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : a not ebook " .
m n021 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ?
m n021 [ s^ ba^ rt ] : A lot m ore expensive ,
m n021 [ s^ ba^ df] : but [ pause] t hat ’s OK ,
m n021 [ s] : I have t he funding
m n021 [ s] : Then I can add a couple of cards at m ost ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : because m m m t he m ajorit y of t he [ disfm arker] of t he
not ebooks only have t wo PC cards uh t ype t wo slot s .
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ s] : In [ disfm arker] in t he bet t er case , m ay be I ’m only able t o
add t wo different net works t o t his t hing .
m n021 [ fh] : So ah
m n021 [ s] : t he difficult y I see is t hat [ pause] ah if we are [ disfm arker]
if y ou want t o t hink in [ disfm arker] in t wo t hree four different
t echnologies um , m aybe we are uh t oo advanced t oo , um , let ’s say ,
uh t oo in advance for t he current t echnology .
m n021 [ s^ ba^ rt ] : Which is not bad ,
m n021 [ s^ df.%−−] : but uh , I ’m just saying t hat it will be able
[ disfm arker] It will [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ fa] : Sorry .
m n021 [ s^ df] : It will be difficult for us t o dev elop a [ disfm arker] a
reasonable t est bed wit h t he available t echnology .
m n021 [ qh:s] : If som ebody t ell us , " OK , now here you have t he t hing
, and just put t hese four net works you want on t he t hing . " How can I
do it now ?
m n021 [ fh] : So m m m
m n021 [ s] : I ’m st ill t rying t o [ disfm arker] you know , t o get used t o t he
uh [ disfm arker] all t he ideas
m n021 [ s] : and t o see t hat all t he t hings are really connect ing
m n021 [ s^ df] : because t his t he eh m ost difficult t hing I see t o
[ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker] t o get t his alignm ent t o t his connect ion
point [ pause] am ong t he different t hings we are t rying t o align .
m n021 [ s] : So t hat ’s why I was proposing t his [ disfm arker] t his
quest ion .
m n021 [ s] : Let ’s assum e we have t he funding .
m n021 [ s] : Now let ’s proceed .
m n021 [ qh] : What [ disfm arker] what kind of t hings we can buy , we
can put t oget her , we can program .
m n021 [ s^ df:qy] : Because oh at t he end uh som ebody will uh be
asking us " OK , did you do your hom ework ?
m n021 [ s.%−−:qy.%−−] : Did you do what you [ disfm arker]

m n021 [ fh] : So .
m n082 [ s] : It ’s clear .
m n082 [ s] : Now from m y point of view in t he beginning , one m ore t im e
, if I see t he four building blocks , and eh I could speak only for m y
skills , I believe t o derive a cert ain kind of QS Reservat ion − in − Advance
schem e Much m ore uh general as it is done for [ disfm arker] for USAIA ,
m n021 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : but m apped t hen really t o desired net work subnet layer
t echnologies .
m n021 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : But for different net works ?
m n082 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n082 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m n021 [ s.%−] : The point is for
m n082 [ %−] : For [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ ar|s^ rt ] : No , for y UMTS .
m n082 [ s] : But first of all , a generic syst em ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : but because you can have several m echanism
m n082 [ s] : really using cert ain kind of [ disfm arker] of um um
quant it at iv e descript ion ,
m n082 [ s] : you can have m ore of a [ pause] qualit at ive descript ion ,
m n082 [ s] : y ou can have t aken int o account m oving pat t erns ,
m n082 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and [ pause] what ever
kind of t hings ,
m n082 [ s] : but t here are a lot of [ disfm arker] lot of ways t o have
cert ain kind of QS Reservat ion − in − Advance ,
m n082 [ s] : and I see it as definit ely is necessary t o have t his one
m n082 [ s] : if I want be m obile and I want t o have not a int errupt ion of
m y [ disfm arker] in m y applicat ion qualit ies of service .
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ fh] : So .
m n082 [ fh] : Um
m n082 [ s] : But t hen , t o go , for inst ance , t o UMTS , and figure out
what is available wit hin UMTS .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : And if I really have an IP applicat ion , where I need t his
kind of [ disfm arker] of [ pause] qualit y of service and having in m ind
t hat cert ain kind of [ pause] QS will be available in t he [ pause] rest of
t he int ernet .
m n082 [ qh] : So how can I m ap t hese t hings uh t o t he UMTS st uff ?
m n082 [ qh] : And what is t he t rend t owards UMTS t o t he first
generat ion ?
m n082 [ qh] : And how it is possible t o m ap t his one t o t his t echnology
?
m n082 [ s] : And if y ou have t he building blocks ident ified , what is
really necessary [ pause] for QS [ disfm arker] eh QS − in − Advance for
[ disfm arker] for m obile syst em s , t hen you have , in principle , t he
ideas for t he following generat ion what you could im prove .

m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ s^ df] : Because t hen you are [ pause] m aybe no m ore relat ed
t o t his kind of t hing .
m n082 [ s] : I believe t he sam e applies for Mult icast .
m n082 [ s] : And I believe t he sam e applies for rout ing .
m n082 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : So , in principle , in t he beginning , t here would be
a cert ain kind of uh paperwork any way ,
m n082 [ s^ cs^ e^ rt ] : som e t heoret ical exam inat ion of t hese problem s
,
m n021 [ s^ na] : I t hink so
m n082 [ s^ e] : and t hen [ pause] som e prot ot ypes m ust be derived
from t hat .
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : And t hen [ pause] m ay be we will st art here wit h a
cert ain kind of uh t est bed equipm ent we st ill have here .
m n082 [ s] : We hav e four uh P Cs available .
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : May be we have t o ext end it t hen ,
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : and figure out som e real scenarios ,
m n082 [ s:s^ fe] : and m aybe t hen pfff !
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Oh yeah .
m n082 [ s^ df.%−−] : Because uh , despit e t he fa
m n082 [ s] : uh uh Hopefully , t hen we have wit h t he m oney also not eh
only for t he room ,
m n021 [ %−] : W
m n082 [ s^ ba] : t hat would be great ,
m n082 [ s] : but t here are also som e sponsors t hen t hen t hen we add
a cert ain kind of field t rial .
m n082 [ s] : But I t hink t hat ’s [ disfm arker] [ pause] pfff ! [ com m ent ]
t hat ’s y ears , y ou know .
m n021 [ s^ 2|s^ aa] : A long way , yeah .
m n082 [ s^ r] : That ’s years .
m n021 [ s^ na] : That ’s right .
m n082 [ s^ cs] : But in t he beginning we m ust have a cert ain kind of
[ pause] t heoret ical fram ework wit h t he relevant t echnology .
m n082 [ s^ e] : Real t echnology .
m n082 [ s] : May be y ou can st art wit h GPS or [ disfm arker] or UMTS , or
what ev er .
m n082 [ s^ df] : because t hese t echnology will definit ely available in
Europe .
m n082 [ s] : There ’s som e m oney [ pause] spent on it ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : so t hat it will be in a cert ain kind of flavor .
m n082 [ s] : It will be available .
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : And it will be also available in t he USA .
m n082 [ s^ df] : Because t here is a big eh harm onizat ion effort ,
m n082 [ s] : despit e t he fact t hey are [ pause] not aligned t o each
ot her anyway ,

m n082 [ s] : but [ pause] t hey will have s also cert ain kind of t hr t hird
generat ion and fourt h generat ion net works .
m n082 [ fh] : So .
m n082 [ s] : And aft er t his t heoret ical fram ework , if t his one is aligned
, OK y ou hav e som e specificat ion
m n082 [ s] : and you set up som e Linux or Free BSD or what ever kind of
prot ot y pe .
m n082 [ s] : So t hat is what I hav e in m ind wit h t hat .
m n082 [ s] : And t hen [ disfm arker] OK , and t hen you will see .
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : The problem is [ disfm arker] which I see is t hat it could be
fruit ful t o st andardizat ion
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : t hat it could be fruit ful t o som e ext ent t o
t elecom m unicat ion providers .
m n082 [ s] : But t here ’s not a real product like you say .
m n082 [ s] : There ’s not t he selling idea behind it .
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Yeah ,
m n082 [ s] : if you go wit h som et hing what [ disfm arker] what Wilbert
m ent ioned " OK , let ’s have t his one here " . We have a new PCMCIA
card and [ disfm arker] and ext end som et hing and t he end syst em , or
what y ou m ent ioned here was t he seam less four t echnologies int er −
working in t he end s , t hen you have an [ disfm arker] an [ disfm arker] a
device which y ou can sell .
m n082 [ s] : If you go for a net working pfff [ com m ent ] um uh
im provem ent s , in principle , and [ disfm arker] and underst anding next
generat ion building blocks , uh t here ’s no product .
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : But it is a long t erm [ disfm arker] it ’s long t erm , I t hink , uh
work y ou can do .
m n082 [ s] : And it ’s m ore relat ed I believe t o t he skills
m n082 [ s^ e] : t o what is available
m n082 [ s^ e] : and [ disfm arker] and current ly as I see what uh will be
av ailable wit hin t he NSA group .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ s] : And uh , t he point is if we focus on [ disfm arker] on t his
net working [ disfm arker] sm all [ disfm arker] m ore net working st uff and
em som e applicat ion guys cam e int o t he boat and t hey focus on t heir
applicat ion st uff , what ever t his m eans , It m ight be we have t hen t he
act ive classroom ,
m n082 [ s] : but it could be anot her one
m n082 [ s] : t hat is not represent at iv e ,
fn083 [ s^ aap|s^ ng] : Yeah but t here ’s som et hing needed t o sell it .
m n082 [ %−] : it ’s only [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ qw^ br] : Hm m ?
fn083 [ s.%−] : And I t hink [ disfm arker]

m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ aap] : Then [ disfm arker] t hen is som et hing available
m n082 [ s^ no] : but I don’t know
m n082 [ s^ df] : y ou know , I ’m not an applicat ion expert ,
m n082 [ %−−] : I [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : We hav e som e cont ent .
m n082 [ s^ cc] : We will t hen discuss it on next Tuesday as I m ent ioned
.
m n021 [ s^ t 3] : Bless you .
fn083 [ s^ t 3] : Bless you .
m n082 [ fh|s] : Uh Any way , but uh t hat were [ disfm arker] is m y answer
t o t he quest ion if som e m oney is available .
m n082 [ s] : The good t hing is t hat t he m oney is available ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : because every body is paid here .
m n082 [ s] : So t hat is m oney t hat t he [ disfm arker] t he sm allest port ion
of m oney which is available .
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : But first of all Wilbert need m ore , definit ely ,
m n082 [ s^ df^ rt ] : because m aybe t hen KPN is uh no m ore int erest ing
t o go on wit h t his work ,
m n082 [ s] : or we can convince wit h t hese kind of t hings which we
have in m ind ,
m n082 [ s^ e] : uh com panies like KPN .
m n082 [ fh] : So
m n082 [ s.%−−] : And if we have ot her suggest ions and eh have t his as
a long t erm
m n082 [ s^ e] : NSA core group act ivit y ,
m n082 [ s] : and t his t heoret ical fram ework , whet her it is finished in
half a y ear or one y ear doesn’t m at t er , in principle ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : because t he road m ap for t he [ disfm arker] t he next
generat ion net works is [ disfm arker] is eh [ disfm arker] is for m any
y ears .
m n082 [ s] : And b before UMTS will be deployed very well , I believe eh
it will be com m on t uh t wo t housand four or som et hing like t hat .
m n082 [ fh] : So .
m n082 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and hav e [ pause] an int erm ediat e project
, which is relat ed in t his direct ion , som et hing like t he seam less
handov er for t wo t echnologies or what ever .
m n082 [ s] : This is a sm aller port ion in t he gen m ore generic
fram ework , I would like t o say , from t his proposal .
m n082 [ qh] : Why not go in t his way ?
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK
m n082 [ s^ no^ rt ] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know .
m n082 [ s] : But uh t hat ’s t he point eh we are sit t ing here t oget her .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n021 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]

m n082 [ s] : But for [ disfm arker] for Diet m ar I t hink eh eh he m ent ioned
it t o m e , it ’s v ery clear t hat he will go on wit h a port ion of t im e , wit h
t his USAIA st uff ,
m n030 [ s^ na] : That ’s right .
m n030 [ s.%−] : It depends on m y [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ e] : in t he m at ical sense
m n082 [ s^ df] : because t hat m eans for you in a cert ain kind
[ disfm arker] a cert ain ext ent , y ou are decoupled from net working st uff
.
m n082 [ s^ df] : Because your focusing on t he m at hem at ical t hing of
whet her it ’s a net work or ot her t hing ,
m n030 [ s.%−] : Well , I ’m foc
m n082 [ s] : it doesn’t m at t er [ disfm arker]
m n030 [ s] : I ’m focused on perform ance evaluat ion
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n030 [ s] : and um [ disfm arker] especially of com m unicat ion net works
m n030 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n030 [ s] : I never eh e um dealed wit h um m obile com m unicat ions .
m n030 [ qh] : So why not ?
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ fh] : So .
m n030 [ s] : So t hat ’s eh , t o open m y m ind .
m n082 [ s] : There is it st ill ongoing act ivit y wit h uh m aybe a port ion of

m n082 [ s] : And independent ly whet her I will leave t he uh uh ICSI in

[ disfm arker] on [ disfm arker] on t hese QS − in − Advance schem es
m n082 [ s^ e] : eh also wit hin Siem ens
m n082 [ s] : and also wit h som e project t here .
m n082 [ s] : And I believe your rout ing st uff is also available ,
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − m m m .
m n082 [ fh] : uh ,
m n082 [ s^ bu^ e|qy ^ d^ g] : And when you [ disfm arker] when you will go
back t o Spain , right ?
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Sure .
m n082 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , so . and [ disfm arker] and t hat ’s why , in
principle , t he skills will be always av ailable I guess .
m n021 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker] and
m n082 [ s.%−] : if t here is a cert ain t ype of project in t he hom e

m n021 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s] : N Not only t his .

m n021 [ s^ cs] : We can even use t his u plat form t o [ disfm arker] t o get

m n021 [ s^ df] : because you know , som et im es eh it ’s a good t hing
[ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ aa] : yeah
m n082 [ s^ am ] : m aybe
m n082 [ s^ bd^ df] : Current ly no m oney is available , you know .
m n021 [ s^ aa|s^ df] : Yeah but [ pause] uh , t his will [ disfm arker] I t hink

m n021 [ fh] : So uh [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ am ] : Probably .
m n021 [ s] : You know , t his kind of joint work of different count ries de

[ disfm arker] t he best place t o [ disfm arker] t o put a project on .
m n021 [ s^ df] : Because it is involving different part ners from different
point s of [ disfm arker] of Europe .
m n082 [ s^ na] : Now , I will not prevent anybody from get t ing som e
cake
m n082 [ s] : and we are sit t ing here t oget her
m n082 [ s^ ba] : it ’s uh very uh v ery slow , in principle ,
m n082 [ s] : but m y last quest ion is for Wilbert .
m n082 [ s] : Wilbert , you I [ disfm arker] I t hink you got t he basic idea
m n082 [ s^ df] : because it was m ost ly discussed wit h you here from
t his current av ailable scrap project proposal .
m n082 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : Don’t you t hink t hat KPN could be convinced t o go
on t his way what I m ent ioned before ?
m n082 [ s^ e^ rt ] : There ’s no way ?
m n081 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n082 [ s] : They needed definit ely , in principle , som e kind of service
or dev ice or product or what ever .
m n081 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n081 [ s^ na] : That ’s right now t he s t he st at us .
m n081 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m n082 [ qy^ rt ] : Can we bot h have t oget her , m aybe , I t hink it ’s a lit t le
bit m ore easier , a discussion on Thursday ?
m n081 [ s] : I ’m out for t h one [ disfm arker] a week and a half .
m n081 [ s] : So on Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , I have a workshop
at St anford
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n081 [ s] : and next week I hav e a week on holiday .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ s^ cs] : May be t hat ’s enough t im e for you t o consider a lit t le
bit m ore in t his direct ion ?
m n081 [ s^ am ] : Could be .
m n082 [ s] : And t hen we could have eh discussion

m n082 [ s] : and m ay be t his one is an overall work , in principle , where
ev ery body could hook in and [ disfm arker] and get cert ain kind of sm all
port ions t o solv e it
m n081 [ b] : Yeah .
m n081 [ s^ bu] : So [ disfm arker] so t he only solut ion would [ disfm arker]
for [ disfm arker] for KPN would be t hat t here is a p a project in t his area
.
m n082 [ %−] : and
m n081 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] t hat m akes sense t o do in t his ar This , I
m ean t he Bay Area
m n021 [ b] : Hm − hm m .
m n081 [ s] : wit h a group of uh a few people ,
m n081 [ s^ e] : like four or som et hing ,
m n081 [ s] : and t hat connect s t o t his project .
m n081 [ s] : So , one som ebody or t wo som ebodies can be found uh
founded [ pause] or get m oney t o join t his project .
m n081 [ s] : But t hat t he ot her four should build a service on t op of it ,
t hat has a clear business focus .
m n082 [ b] : m m − hm m .
m n081 [ s] : It m eans eh a [ disfm arker] a UMTS service basically .
m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ qy] : Can you consider pot en also in t he m eant im e , som e
pot ent ial UMTS serv ices besides t his one ?
m n081 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n081 [ s^ aa|s^ nd] : Yeah , but y ou see t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t hey ask som et hing pret t y st range .
m n082 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m n081 [ s] : They [ disfm arker] t hey want som et hing pret t y st range from
m e t hat I t hink of a service ,
m n081 [ s^ e] : a net work service .
m n081 [ s] : There are sixt y m illion billion people in t he [ vocalsound]
[ disfm arker] in t he world t hat t hink of serv ices all day
m n081 [ s] : and t ry t o m ake a lot of m oney wit h it in t he form of st art −
ups or what ev er .
m n081 [ s] : And just t hink of a service like t hat , if I could do t his .
m n082 [ s^ ar|s] : No , but , uh fff [ com m ent ] m aybe based on t his one
and you see t he net working st uff
m n081 [ %−] : w
m n082 [ s] : t hat it is a lit t le bit m ore evol evolved and [ disfm arker]
t han in t he [ disfm arker] t he core net work t echnology in t he access
net work , I would like t o say .
m n081 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : And t his is aligned t hen as m uch as possible t o t he
int ernet .
m n082 [ s] : That ’s t he basic idea ,

m n082 [ s] : t hat you can have a cert ain kind of service which m ake use
of t hese novel t hings .
m n081 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s^ df] : Because norm ally I [ disfm arker] I believe t he
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he people are eit her on t he applicat ion
lay er ,
m n081 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker] you know [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : t hat m eans higher t han layer four ,
m n082 [ s] : or t hey are on layer f one t o l l up t o layer four .
m n081 [ %−] : Bu
m n082 [ s.%−−] : And t he service people are considering
m n082 [ s] : " OK , UMTS
m n082 [ s] : you have som e locat ion inform at ion ,
m n082 [ s] : and m ay be you are [ disfm arker] have t he infrast ruct ure in
t he car ,
m n082 [ s] : so , if I provide a cert ain kind of service , independent ly
what t he net work is offering , you know .
m n082 [ s] : Because t hey do not consider it very well .
m n082 [ s] : They know t here is a cert ain kind of locat ion inform at ion
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : and y ou have a GPS ,
m n082 [ s:s] : and t hey know , OK , it ’s based on sat ellit e .
m n082 [ s^ e:s] : And t here ’s UMTS , t hat is based on base st at ion .
m n082 [ s] : There ’s all t hat t hey consider .
m n082 [ s:s] : And t hen assum e , OK , I can do t hat .
m n082 [ s:s] : And t he net working guy said OK it would be great t o have
Mult icast and all t hese kind of t hings in t he net work ,
m n082 [ s] : but do not consider really what a sense of benefit uh for
applicat ions ,
m n082 [ s] : t here were new app old applicat ion m ake use of it
m n082 [ s] : and how can new applicat ion arise
m n082 [ s^ e] : which we haven’t considered up t o now based on t his
new net work funct ion , LAT enrich [ disfm arker] enriched net work
funct ion , LAT .
m n082 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : So , I t hink it ’s wort h t o [ disfm arker] t o consider
som et hing in t hat way
m n081 [ s] : Well , u unt il now I have been t rying t o t hink about it ,
m n081 [ %−−] : but eh f t o m e u
m n081 [ s] : what I have every [ disfm arker] every t im e I encount ered it ,
it is all [ disfm arker] t his is all pret t y close by ,
m n081 [ s] : like t he indust ry is already behind t his .
m n082 [ fg|qw.%−] : Yeah , what is our [ disfm arker]
m n081 [ s] : So t hey [ disfm arker] t hey want t o m ake t his available
pret t y soon .
m n081 [ s] : So I ’m just t rying t o t hink uh m m ore ahead , like uh use
t he wireless dev ice as a [ disfm arker] only as a signalling t hing or
som et hing .

m n081 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so whenever you com e in wit h your uh GSM
phone and t here is a PC available , like everyt hing will be direct ed t o
t he [ disfm arker] t he bigger device or som et hing .
m n081 [ s] : So m ore services like t hat .
m n081 [ s] : I t hink [ pause] t he t hey are working pret t y hard t o get IP
av ailable very good and efficient ly from uh t wo m obile devices or
wireless dev ices .
m n082 [ s] : Not current ly t here is a t echno t echnology split .
m n081 [ %−] : a t h t hing
m n082 [ s] : Of course you have IP in t he m obile device
m n082 [ s] : but if y ou see t he st range prot ocols t ext
m n082 [ s] : t here ’s IP over IP and t unnels and [ disfm arker] and
what ev er ,
m n082 [ s] : so , but it ’s uh looks very st range t o m e
m n082 [ s^ df] : because you hav e different num bering screens ,
concerning y ou have a phone num ber ,
m n082 [ s^ df^ e] : y ou have t o m ap it t o IP addresses
m n082 [ s^ e] : and [ disfm arker] and so on ,
m n082 [ s] : but for m e , you hav e not t he end t o end part s of for
[ disfm arker] for IP funct ionalit y .
m n082 [ s] : We are far away from t hat .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : And if you t ake a really look t o t he GPRS prot ocols
t ex t s and I believe also t hey apply for UMTS but I ’m not
m n082 [ s] : eh v ery fam iliar wit h t hat ,
m n082 [ s] : and t he next generat ions access net work is [ disfm arker]
will com e soon .
m n082 [ s] : You see it ’s every t hree years or four years t hey will have
a new generat ion .
m n081 [ s.%−] : And t here ’s a [ disfm arker] We m
m n082 [ s.%−] : But anyway you [ disfm arker]
m n081 [ s] : Our group m ight fo want t o focus on t he uh IP over et her
no net s
m n082 [ b] : yeah ?
m n082 [ b] : y eah ?
m n081 [ s.%−−] : or som et hing like
m n081 [ s^ e] : or ov er et her [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ qw] : Why ?
m n082 [ qw] : What kind [ disfm arker] what kind [ disfm arker] IP over
what do you call it ?
m n081 [ s] : N no net s ,
m n082 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ m ] : No net .
m n081 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ ba] : That would be great !
m n081 [ %−] : Ov er [ disfm arker]
m n081 [ s] : Like only over et her .
m n081 [ s] : carefully int egrat ed for net

m n081 [ s] : but t here is no net .
m n081 [ s^ rt ] : If y ou want t o do [ disfm arker] m ake like also for
wireless dev ices end t o end IP available , t hat could be a vision .
m n081 [ fh] : Like .
m n082 [ qy] : Can you repeat it ?
m n081 [ s] : Well , so he [ disfm arker] he says well IP t o IP or end t o end
IP , is far [ disfm arker] [ pause] well , it ’s far away .
m n081 [ fh] : um
m n081 [ s] : So you [ disfm arker] what y ou m ight want t o do is well get U
M T S out t here
m n081 [ s] : and just do uh I Ps play ing over radio .
m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : Som et hing like t hat is m y final vision .
m n081 [ s] : Like [ disfm arker] like SDH , IP over fiber or WDM − WDM .
m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n081 [ s] : This get s rid of t he SDH .
m n081 [ s^ rt ] : Or , well , st art wit h get rid of t he ATM first
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ 2] : ATM st uff .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n081 [ s^ rt ] : and t hen get rid of SDH .
m n082 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n082 [ s] : There ’s [ disfm arker] t he problem is [ disfm arker] is , you
see t hat t he providers eh have alway s t here broken view for
[ disfm arker] for t he m anagem ent .
m n082 [ s] : If you have different kind of prot ocols t ext s and net work
m anagem ent sy st em , and t he billing syst em and all t hese kinds of
t hings which is besides t he net working st uff , in principle , but you st ill
need it , is eh not aligned .
m n081 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s] : We have it for different islands
m n021 [ b.%] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and
m n082 [ s|s^ f] : Well , t hat ’s m y final vision you know .
m n082 [ s] : If you have really t hen IP net works at a cert ain generat ion
where y ou hav e really t he physical m edia and where necessary uh
addit ional m aclear prot ocols ,
m n082 [ s] : and t hen you have really always end t o end .
m n082 [ s] : It m akes you t hings m uch m ore sim ple m uch m ore easier ,
m n021 [ fg] : Uh .
m n082 [ s^ df] : uh , but is far far away , you know .
m n021 [ s] : Unless [ disfm arker] unless we speak about qualit y of
serv ice ,
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .

m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ e] : which is not eh em bedded on [ disfm arker] on IP
serv ices .
m n082 [ s^ aap|s^ df^ nd] : Yeah but you have t he ext ension for t he eh
qualit y of service m echanism
m n021 [ s^ aap|s^ df^ nd.%−] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ e] : which you have t o m ap t hen t o t he underlying
t echnology .
m n021 [ s^ aap|s^ df^ nd] : Yeah but for exam ple nobody ’s really using
RSVP .
m n082 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ aap|s^ df^ nd] : Yeah but m aybe in t he LAN int erface it
m akes
m n082 [ s^ df.%−] : since t o use it
m n081 [ fg|s^ cs] : Eh you guys do t hat discussion lat er on please ,
m n082 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] But
m n082 [ s^ bk] : yeah
m n081 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : uh ?
m n082 [ s] : but I t hink we sh we will m iss t he cake
m n021 [ s^ bk|s^ fa] : OK , sorry , sorry .
m n081 [ s^ e] : RSVP .
m n082 [ s^ cs.%−−] : and I t hink we should st op now but please
ev ery body ,
m n082 [ %−−] : short
m n082 [ %−−] : eh s
m n082 [ s^ cs] : go on wit h considerat ions and pot ent ial
m n082 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and uh
m n082 [ s] : um we didn’t m ake s m uch progress t oday in t he m eet ing ,
m n082 [ s] : but anyway t his kind of act ivit y lives from all , from t he
input of all .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : And so I really
m n082 [ s^ cs] : if som ebody has an idea send an em ail
m n082 [ s.%−−] : and t hen I would like t o enforce everybody
m n082 [ s^ bd] : not t hat I ’m doing everyt hing
m n082 [ s^ df] : I could not [ disfm arker] I f didn’t have t he t im e in t he
past
m n082 [ s^ e] : and I will not hav e it in t he fut ure
m n082 [ s] : and m ay be I will st ay here only s four weeks or five weeks .
m n082 [ s] : So it would be really not t he best t hing if t he act ivit y is
dead when I am leav ing
m n082 [ s] : and if I st ay longer of course we can go on
m n082 [ s] : but nevert heless I rely heav ily uh also from t he
cont ribut ions of ev erybody ,
m n082 [ s] : and it ’s in t heir own int erest
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .

m n021 [ s^ na] : That ’s right .
m n082 [ s] : of [ disfm arker] of everybody , also from t he inst it ut ion
behind . So If t here is cert ain kind of idea or quest ions or what ever ,
we are s only a sm all group of people
m n082 [ s] : we can easily join on a whit e board and [ disfm arker] and
st art a discussion .
m n021 [ s.%−] : Well , if [ pause] Klaus [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : It m ust not be on every Tuesday , you know ,
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ s^ e] : at a cert ain t im e .
m n082 [ s] : And I t ry t o m ot ivat e t he people .
m n082 [ s] : That it ’s free .
m n082 [ s] : That ’s a st art ing .
m n082 [ s] : That ’s a ram p .
m n082 [ s] : And we can go in different direct ions .
m n082 [ s] : And if y ou have a real focus on t he cert ain novel t hing for
t he services or UMTS or what ev er , great .
m n082 [ s] : If not , t he long t erm and t hen t hese t hings m ust be ,
nevert heless [ disfm arker] m ust be defined in m uch m ore det ail .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ?
m n082 [ s^ ft ] : So , t hanks
m n021 [ b] : OK
m n081 [ s^ bk] : OK
m n082 [ s] : please do not , um what Adam m ent ioned t o
