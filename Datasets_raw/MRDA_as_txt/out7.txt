m e010 [ z] : t hey would like us all t o read t hese digit s .
m e010 [ z] : But we don’t all read t hem
m e010 [ z] : but a couple people read t hem .
m n048 [ z] : OK .
m e010 [ z] : Uh , wanna give t hem all wit h Germ an accent s t oday or
[ disfm arker] ?
m n015 [ z] : Sure .
m e010 [ z] : OK .
m n015 [ z] : OK
m n015 [ z] : and t he way you do it is you just read t he num bers not as
uh each single ,
m n015 [ z] : so just like I do it .
m n048 [ z] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ z] : OK .
m n015 [ z] : First y ou read t he t ranscript num ber .
m n047 [ z] : OK ,
m n015 [ z] : Turn .
m n047 [ z] : uh [ disfm arker] What ’s [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ t ^ t c] : OK . Let ’s be done wit h t his .
m e010 [ s^ t c] : OK .
m n048 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : t his is Am i , who [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : And t his is Tilm an and Ralf .
m n048 [ s] : Hi .
m n048 [ s] : Uh − huh . Nice t o m eet you .
m n047 [ s^ m ] : Hi .
m e010 [ s] : Hi .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : So we ’re gonna t ry t o finish by five so people who want t o
can go hear Nancy Chang ’s t alk , uh downst airs .
m n048 [ b] : Hm m .

m e010 [ s^ bu] : And you guys are g giving t alks on t om orrow and
Wednesday lunch t im es ,
m n048 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ qy^ d^ g] : right ?
m e010 [ s^ bk] : That ’s great .
m e010 [ qy ^ rt ] : OK so , do y do y ou know what we ’re gonna do ?
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : I t hought t wo t hings
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : uh we ’ll int roduce ourselves and what we do .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : And um we already t alked wit h Andreas , Thilo and
Dav id
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : and som e lines of code were already writ t en t oday
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : and alm ost t est ed
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : and just gonna say we have um again t he recognizer t o
parser t hing where we ’re working on
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : and t hat should be no problem
m n015 [ s] : and t hen t hat can be sort of developed uh as needed
when we get [ disfm arker] ent er t he t ourism dom ain .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : em we have t alked t his m orning wit h t he [ disfm arker]
wit h Tilm an about t he generat or .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : and um There one of our diligent workers has t o sort of
v olunt eer t o look over Tilm an ’s shoulder while he is changing t he
gram m ars t o English
m n048 [ %−−] : S
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : because w we have [ disfm arker] we face t wo ways .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : Eit her we do a syllable concat enat ing um gram m ar for
t he English generat ion which is sort of st art ing from scrat ch and doing
it t he easy way ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : or we sim ply adopt t he ah um m ore in − dept h um st yle
t hat is im plem ent ed in t he Germ an syst em
m n015 [ s] : and um are t hen able not only t o produce st rings but also
t he sy nt act ic parse
m n015 [ s^ bsc.%−−] : uh not parse not
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : t he synt act ic t ree t hat is underneat h in t he synt act ic
st ruct ure
m n015 [ s^ df^ rt ] : which is t he way we decided we were gonna go
because A , it ’s easier in t he beginning
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : and um it does require som e [ disfm arker] som e knowledge
of [ disfm arker] of t hose gram m ars and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker]
and som e ling linguist ic background .
m n015 [ s^ df] : But um it shouldn’t be a problem for anyone .
m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : OK So That sounds good .
m e010 [ qy ^ rt ] : Johno , are you gonna have som e t im e t t o do t hat uh
w wit h t hese guys ?

m e003 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m e010 [ s^ ba^ df] : cuz y you ’re t he gram m ar m aven .
m e003 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ bu] : I m ean it m akes sense ,
m e010 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : doesn’t it ?
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yeah Good .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : So , I t hink t hat ’s probably t he [ disfm arker] t he right
way t o do t hat .
m e010 [ fh] : And an
m e010 [ s] : Yeah , so I [ disfm arker] I act ually wanna f t o find out about
it t oo ,
m e010 [ s] : but I m ay not have t im e t o get in .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : t he [ disfm arker] t he ult im at e goal is t hat before t hey
leav e we [ disfm arker] we can run t hrough t he ent ire syst em input
t hrough out put on at least one or t wo sam ple t hings .
m n015 [ s] : And um and by virt ue of doing t hat t hen in t his case Johno
will hav e acquired t he knowledge of how t o ext end it .
m n015 [ s] : Ad infinit um .
m n015 [ s] : When needed , if needed , when want ed and so fort h .
m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ ba^ rt ] : OK t hat sounds great .
m n015 [ s] : And um also um Ralf has hooked up wit h David and you ’re
gonna cont inue eit her all t hrough t onight or t om orrow on what ever t o
get t he er parser int erface working .
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m n015 [ s] : They are t hinning out and t hickening out lat t ices
m n015 [ s] : and doing t his kind of st uff t o see what works best .
m n047 [ b] : Mm m ,
m n047 [ b] : yep .
m e010 [ b] : Great .
m e010 [ qy^ rt ] : So , you guys enjoy your weekend ?

m e010 [ b] : Great .
m e010 [ s^ t c.%−−] : OK , so t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : Sort of one branch is t o get us caught up on what ’s going
on .
m e010 [ s^ cs] : Also of course it would be really nice t o know what t he
plans are , in addit ion t o what ’s sort of already in code .
m n048 [ b] : Yes .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : and we can d
m e010 [ s^ no] : I dunno

m e010 [ qy ^ rt ] : w w was t here uh a t im e when we were set up t o do
t hat ?
m e010 [ s^ cs] : It probably will work bet t er if we do it lat er in t he week ,
aft er [ pause] we act ually underst and uh bet t er what ’s going on .
m n048 [ b] : Yes .
m n047 [ b] : Hm m .
m n048 [ b] : Yeah .

m n048 [ s] : All t hrough Friday would be fine .
m e010 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ fg] : OK , So [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ cc] : so anyt we ’ll find a t im e lat er in t he week t o uh get
t oget her and t alk about [ pause] your underst anding of what
Sm art Kom plans are .
m n048 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ e] : and how we can change t hem .
m n048 [ s^ bk] : Yes . Sure .
m e010 [ fh] : Uh ,
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ] : Should we already set a dat e for t hat ?
m n015 [ s^ df] : Might be beneficial while we ’re all here .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : OK ?
m e010 [ h|s] : um What [ disfm arker] what does not work for m e is
Thursday aft ernoon .
m e010 [ s^ cs] : I can do earlier in t he day on Thursday , or [ pause] um
[ pause] m ost of t he t im e on Friday ,
m e010 [ s^ e] : not all .
m n015 [ qy ^ cs^ d^ rt ] : Thursday m orning sounds fine ?
m e010 [ qo^ rt ] : Wha − but , Johno ,
m n048 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ qw] : what are your const raint s ?
m e003 [ h|s.%−] : um Thursday aft ernoon doesn’t work for m e , but
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : Neit her does Thursday m orning ,
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : no ?
m e003 [ h|s] : Uh Thursday m orning should be fine .
m e010 [ qy ^ cs^ d^ rt ] : Eleven ?
m n048 [ s^ aa] : OK .
m e010 [ qy ^ d^ r^ rt ] : Eleven on Thursday ?
m e003 [ s^ rt ] : I was just t hinking I w I will [ pause] have [ pause]
leav ened by eleven .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right . Right .
m e010 [ s] : This is t hen out of deference t o our non − m orning people .

m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n048 [ b] : OK .
m n048 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So at eleven ?
m n047 [ qw^ br] : Hm m .
m n048 [ qy^ bu^ d^ r^ rt ] : Thursday around eleven ?
m n048 [ s^ bk.%] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ cs] : And act ually we can inv it e um Andreas as well .
m n015 [ s^ ng] : Uh he will be in Washingt on , t hough .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Oh t hat ’s t rue .
m e010 [ s] : He ’s off [ disfm arker] off on his t rip already .
m n015 [ s] : but um David is here and he ’s act ually knows everyt hing
about t he Sm art Kom recognizer .
m e010 [ s] : Thilo .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK well yeah
m e010 [ s^ cs] : m ay be we ’ll see if Dav id could m ake it .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : That would be good .
m n015 [ fg] : OK so
m n015 [ s.%−−] : facing t o [ disfm arker] t o what we ’ve sort of been doing
here
m n015 [ h] : um
m n015 [ s] : well for one t hing we ’re also using t his room t o collect
dat a .
m n048 [ s^ bd] : Yeah obviously .
m n015 [ fh|s.x] : um um Not t his t ype of dat a ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : no not m eet ing dat a but sort of [ disfm arker] sort ah
our v ersion of a wizard experim ent such
m n048 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n015 [ s] : not like t he ones in Munich but pret t y close t o it .
m n048 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : The m ajor difference t o t he Munich ones is t hat we do it
v ia t he t elephone
m n048 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : even t hough all t he recording is done here
m n015 [ s] : and so it ’s a [ disfm arker] sort of a com put er call syst em
t hat giv es y ou t ourist inform at ion
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : t ells you how t o get places .
m n015 [ s] : And it breaks halfway t hrough t he experim ent and a
hum an operat or com es on .
m n015 [ s] : and part of t hat is sort of t rying t o find out whet her people
change t heir linguist ic verbal behavior when first t hinking t hey speak
t o a m achine and t hen t o a hum an .
m n048 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : and we ’re set t ing it up so t hat we can [ disfm arker] we
hope t o im plant cert ain int ent ions in people .

m n015 [ s:qw] : For exam ple um we have first looked at a sim ple
sent ence t hat " How do I get t o t he Powder − Tower ? "
m n015 [ s^ f] : OK so y ou have t he [ disfm arker] cast le of Heidelberg
m n048 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : and t here is a t ower and it ’s called Powder − Tower .
m n048 [ b] : Oh , OK .
m n048 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ qh] : and um so What will you parse out of t hat sent ence ?
m n015 [ s] : Probably som et hing t hat we specified in M − t hree − L ,
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m n015 [ s] : t hat is @ @ [ com m ent ] " act ion go t o what ever dom ain ,
object what ev er Powder − Tower " .
m n015 [ s] : And m ay be som e m odel will t ell us , som e GPS m odule , in
t he m obile scenario where t he person is at t he m om ent .
m n015 [ s] : And um we ’ve sort of gone t hrough t hat once before in
t he Deep Mail project
m n015 [ s.%−−] : and we not iced t hat first of all what are [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : I should ’ve brought som e slides ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : but what our [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : So here ’s t he t ower .
m n015 [ s] : Think of t his as a t wo − dim ensional represent at ion of t he
t ower .
m n015 [ s] : And our syst em led people here , t o a point where t hey
were facing a wall in front of t he t ower .
m n015 [ s] : There is no ent rance t here , but it just happens t o be t he
closest point of t he road net work t o t he geom et ric cent er
m n015 [ s] : Because t hat ’s how t he algorit hm works .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : So we t ook out t hat part of t he road net work as a hack
m n015 [ s] : and t hen it found act ually t he way t o t he ent rance .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : which was now t he closest point of t he road net work t o
m n048 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : OK , geom et ric cent er .
m n015 [ s] : But what we act ually observed in Heidelberg is t hat m ost
people when t hey want t o go t here t hey act ually don’t want t o ent er ,
m n015 [ s^ df] : because it ’s not really int erest ing .
m n015 [ s] : They wanna go t o a com plet ely different point where t hey
can look at it and t ake a pict ure .
m n048 [ b] : Oh , OK .
m n047 [ b] : Hm m .
m n048 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : And so what uh uh a s you s
m n015 [ s] : let ’s say a sim ple parse from a s from an ut t erance won’t
really give us is what t he person act ually want s .
m n015 [ qy ] : Does he wanna go t here t o see it ?
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ] : Does he wanna go t here now ?
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : Lat er ?

m n015 [ qw] : How does t he person wanna go t here ?
m n015 [ qy ] : Is t hat person m ore likely t o want t o walk t here ?
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : Walk a scenic rout e ?
m n015 [ s] : and so fort h .
m n015 [ s] : There are all kinds of decisions t hat we have ident ified in
t erm s of get t ing t o places and in t erm s of finding inform at ion about
t hings .
m n015 [ s] : And we are const ruct ing [ disfm arker] and t hen we ’ve
ident ified m ore or less t he ext ra − linguist ic param et ers t hat m ay f play
a role .
m n015 [ s] : Inform at ion relat ed t o t he user and inform at ion relat ed t o
t he sit uat ion .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : And we also want t o look closely on t he linguist ic
inform at ion t hat
m n015 [ s] : what we can get from t he ut t erance .
m n015 [ s] : That ’s part of why we im plant t hese int ent ions in t he dat a
collect ion t o see whet her people act ually phrase t hings different ly
m n015 [ s^ e] : whet her t hey want t o ent er in order t o buy som et hing
or whet her t hey just wanna go t here t o look at it .
m n015 [ fh|s] : And um so t he idea is t o const ruct uh um suit able
int erfaces and a belief − net for a m odule t hat act ually t ries t o guess
what t he underly ing int ent ion [ pause] was .
m n015 [ s] : And t hen enrich or augm ent t he M − t hree − L st ruct ures
wit h what it t hought what m ore it sort of got out of t hat ut t erance .
m n015 [ s] : So if it can m ake a good suggest ion , " Hey ! "
m n015 [ s] : y ou know , " t hat person doesn’t wanna ent er .
m n015 [ s] : That person just want s t o t ake a pict ure , " cuz he just
bought film ,
m n015 [ s] : or " t hat person want s t o ent er because he discussed t he
adm ission fee before " .
m n015 [ s] : Or " t hat person want s t o ent er because he want s t o buy
som et hing
m n015 [ s] : and t hat you usually do inside of buildings " and so fort h .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : These ah t hese t ypes of uh t hese bit s of addit ional
inform at ion are going t o be em bedded int o t he M − t hree − L st ruct ure
in an [ disfm arker] sort of subfield t hat we have reserved .
m n015 [ s] : And if t he act ion planner does som et hing wit h it , great .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : If not you know , t hen t hat ’s also som et hing um t hat
we can’t really [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : at least we [ com m ent ] want t o offer t he ext ra inform at ion .
We don’t really [ disfm arker] um we ’re not t oo worried .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n047 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ s] : I m ean [ disfm arker] t s Ult im at ely if you have [ disfm arker] if
y ou can offer t hat inform at ion , som ebody ’s gonna s do som et hing
wit h it sooner or lat er .

m n015 [ s] : That ’s sort of part of our belief .
m e003 [ qw.%] : What was he say ing ?
m n015 [ s] : Um , for exam ple , right now I know t he GIS from em ail is
not able t o calculat e t hese viewpoint s .
m n015 [ s] : So t hat ’s a funct ionalit y t hat doesn’t exist yet t o do t hat
dynam ically ,
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s.x ] : but if we can offer it t hat dist inct ion , m aybe som ebody
will go ahead and im plem ent it .
m n015 [ s] : Surely nobody ’s gonna go ahead and im plem ent it if it ’s
never gonna be used ,
m n015 [ fh] : so .
m n015 [ qh] : What have I forgot t en about ?
m n015 [ s^ fe] : Oh y eah ,
m e010 [ %−] : Well t h uh
m n015 [ qh] : how we do it ,
m n015 [ s.%−] : y eah t hat ’s t he
m e010 [ s^ ar] : No no .
m e010 [ s^ cs] : It ’s a good t im e t o pause .
m e010 [ s] : I s I see [ pause] quest ions on peoples ’ faces ,
m e010 [ qh^ cs.%−−] : so why don’t [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : let ’s [ disfm arker] let ’s [ disfm arker] Let ’s hear
[ disfm arker]
m n048 [ b.x ] : Oh
m n048 [ qw^ rt ] : Well t he obvious one would be if [ disfm arker] if you
envision t his as a m odule wit hin Sm art Kom , where exact ly would t hat
Sit ?
m n015 [ h|s.x ] : um [ disfm arker] so far I ’ve t hought of it as sort of
adding it ont o t he m odeler knowledge m odule .
m n048 [ s.%−] : That ’s t he d
m n047 [ b.x] : Hm m .
m n048 [ s^ bk.x ] : OK , yeah .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : So t his is one t hat already adds addit ional inform at ion
t o t he
m n048 [ s^ ba] : Makes perfect sense .
m n048 [ s^ bk] : Yes .
m n047 [ b] : Hm m , ah .
m n015 [ s] : but it could sit anywhere in t he at t ent ion − recognit ion
m n015 [ s.%−−] : I m ean basically t his is what at t ent ion − recognit ion
lit erally sort of can [ disfm arker]
m n048 [ s^ 2] : Well it ’s supposed t o do .
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m n048 [ s^ bk] : Yeah
m e010 [ s^ bc] : That ’s what it should do .
m e010 [ b] : Right ,
m e010 [ b] : yeah .

m n048 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n048 [ b] : Yeah .
m n047 [ b] : Huh .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n048 [ s] : Well f from m y underst anding of what t he people at Phillips
were originally t rying t o do doesn’t seem t o quit e fit int o Sm art Kom
current ly
m n048 [ s] : so what t hey ’re really doing right now is only select ing
am ong t he alt ernat ives , t he hy pot heses t hat t hey ’re given enriched
by t he dom ain knowledge and t he um discourse m odeler and so on .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n048 [ s^ cs] : So if [ disfm arker] if t his is addit ional inform at ion t hat
could be m erged in by t hem .
m n048 [ s] : And t hen it would be available t o act ion planning and
[ disfm arker] and ot hers .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ %−] : t he [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ %−−] : let ’s [ disfm arker] let ’s
m e010 [ %−−] : That w
m e010 [ s^ t ^ t c] : OK t hat was one quest ion .
m e010 [ qy .%−−] : Is t here ot her [ disfm arker] ot her t hings t hat
m e010 [ s^ df] : cuz [ pause] we wanna not Pa − pass over any [ pause]
y ou know , quest ions or concerns t hat y ou have .
m n048 [ s] : Well t here ’re [ disfm arker] t here ’re t wo levels of
[ disfm arker] of giving an answer and I guess on bot h levels I don’t have
any um furt her quest ions .
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m n048 [ s] : uh t he [ disfm arker] t he t wo levels will be as far as I ’m
concerned as [ pause] uh st anding here for t he generat ion m odule
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m n048 [ s] : and t he ot her is [ disfm arker] is m y underst anding of what
Sm art Kom uh is supposed t o be
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m n048 [ s^ ba] : and I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat fit s in perfect ly
m e010 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] well , let m e [ disfm arker] Let m e s [ pause]
ex pand on t hat a lit t le bit from t he point of view of t he generat ion .
m n047 [ b] : Hm m .
m n048 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So t he idea is t hat we ’v e act ually got t his all laid out
an and we could show it t o you ig
m e010 [ s.%−−] : um Robert didn’t bring it t oday but t here ’s a
[ disfm arker] a belief − net which is [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : There ’s a first cut at a belief − net t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
doesn’t [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] isn’t fully uh inst ant iat ed ,

m e010 [ s] : and in part icular som e of t he [ disfm arker] t he com binat ion
rules and ways of get t ing t he [ disfm arker] t he condit ional probabilit ies
aren’t t here .
m e010 [ s] : But we believe t hat we have laid out t he fundam ent al
decisions in t his lit t le space
m n048 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : and t he t hings t hat influence t hem .
m e010 [ s] : So one of t he decisions is what we call t his AVE t hing .
m e010 [ qh] : Do you want t o um access , view or ent er a t hing .
m n047 [ b] : Hm m .
m e010 [ s] : So t hat ’s a a discret e decision .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : There are only t hree possibilit ies and t he uh
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : what one would like is for t his uh , knowledge m odeling
m odule t o add which of t hose it is and give it t o t he planner .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : But , uh t h t he current design suggest s t hat if it seem s t o
be an im port ant decision and if t he belief − net is equivocal so t hat it
doesn’t say t hat one of t hese is m uch m ore probable t han t he ot her ,
t hen an opt ion is t o go back and ask for t he inform at ion you want .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ qy^ d^ f] : Alright ?
m e010 [ s] : Now t here are t wo ways one can go [ disfm arker] a im agine
doing t hat .
m e010 [ s] : For t he debugging we ’ll probably just have a [ disfm arker]
a drop − down m enu
m e010 [ s.%−−] : and t he [ disfm arker] while you ’re debugging you will
just [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ b] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : But for a full syst em , t hen one m ight very well form ulat e a
query ,
m e010 [ s:qy] : giv e it t o t he dialogue planner and say t his , you know
ar are y ou know y ou [ disfm arker] are y ou planning t o ent er ?
m n048 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : Or what ever it [ disfm arker] what ever t hat m ight be .
m e010 [ s] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker] under t hat m odel
m e010 [ s] : t hen , There would be a [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] um a
loop in which t his t hing would form ulat e a query ,
m n048 [ b] : Yes .
m e010 [ s] : presum ably give it t o you .
m e010 [ s] : That would get expressed and t hen hopefully you know ,
y ou ’d get an answer [ pause] back .
m n048 [ b] : Yep .
m e010 [ s] : And t hat would of course [ disfm arker] t he answer would
have t o be parsed .

m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right
m n047 [ b] : Yep .
m e010 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ fh] : OK so , [ pause] t h [ pause] t hat uh ,
m n048 [ b.%] : Yes .
m e010 [ s] : We probably won’t do t his early on , because t he current
focus is m ore on t he decision m aking and st uff like t hat .
m n048 [ b.%] : Yep .
m e010 [ s] : But While we ’re on t he subject I just want ed t o give you a
sort of head ’s up t hat it could be t hat som e m ont hs from now we said
" OK we ’re now ready t o t ry t o close t hat loop " in t erm s of querying
about som e of t hese decisions .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n047 [ b] : Hm m .
m n048 [ b] : Yep .
m n048 [ fg|s] : So [ disfm arker] m y suggest ion t hen is t hat you um look
int o t he current ly ongoing discussion about how t he act ion plans are
supposed t o look like .
m n048 [ s] : And t hey ’re current ly um Agreeing or [ disfm arker] or in t he
process of agreeing on an X M L − ificat ion of um som et hing like a st at e
− t ransit ion net work of how dialogues would proceed .
m n048 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] The [ disfm arker] t hese um t ransit ion
net works uh will be what t he act ion planner int erpret s in a sense .
m e010 [ b] : Hm m .
m e010 [ qy^ rt ] : D did you know t his Robert ?
m n015 [ s^ bu] : uh Michael is doing t hat ,
m n015 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n048 [ s^ aap] : Well uh Marcus Lerkult is act ually im plem ent ing t hat
st uff
m n048 [ s] : and Marcus and Michael t oget her are um leading t he
discussion t here ,
m n015 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : OK .
m n048 [ b] : y eah .
m e010 [ s] : So we ha we have t o get in on t hat .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m n048 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e010 [ s] : because um part ly t hose are like X − schem as .
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m n048 [ s^ aa] : Definit ely .
m e010 [ s] : t he t ransit ion diagram s .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
m e010 [ s] : And it m ay be t hat [ disfm arker] t hat um we should early on
m ake sure t hat t hey have t he flexibilit y t hat we need .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .

m n015 [ s.%−−] : But t hey uh
m n015 [ qy^ rt ] : Have I underst ood t his right ?
m n015 [ s^ bu] : They [ disfm arker] t hey govern m ore or less t he
[ disfm arker] t he dialogue behavior or t he act ion [ disfm arker]
m n048 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : It ’s not really what you do wit h t he cont ent of t he
dialogue but it ’s
m n015 [ s.%−] : So , I m ean t here is t his [ disfm arker] t his [ disfm arker]
t his nice int erf
m n047 [ s^ ar] : uh , No ,
m n047 [ s.%−−] : it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s also a quant rant uh uh
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qy^ bu.%−−] : i Is it [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : So t here ’s ac so t here [ disfm arker] t h t he word " act ion " ,
OK , is [ disfm arker] is what ’s am biguous here .
m n047 [ s^ am ] : I t hink .
m n047 [ b] : Hm m .
m n048 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m e010 [ fh|s] : So , um one t hing is t here ’s an act ual planner t hat t ells
t he person in t he t ourist dom ain now ,
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : per t ells t he person how t o go ,
m n048 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : " First go here ,
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : first go t here
m n047 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : uh , y ou know , t ake a bus " ,
m e010 [ s] : what ever it is .
m e010 [ s] : So t hat ’s t hat form of planning , and act ion , and a rout e
planner and GIS , all sort of st uff .
m e010 [ fh|s] : uh But I t hink t hat isn’t what you m ean .
m n048 [ s^ aa] : No .
m n048 [ s^ df] : No , in Sm art Kom t erm inology t hat ’s um called a
funct ion t hat ’s m odeled by a funct ion m odeler .
m n048 [ s] : And it ’s t h t hat ’s com plet ely um encapsulat ed from t h t he
dialogue syst em .
m n048 [ s] : That ’s sim ply a funct ionalit y t hat you give dat a as in a
query
m n048 [ s] : and t hen you get back from t hat m m m , a funct ioning
m odel um which m ight be a planner or a VCR or what ever .
m n048 [ s] : um som e result and t hat ’s t hen [ disfm arker] t hen used .
m e010 [ fg|s^ bk] : Well , OK ,
m e010 [ fg|s] : so t hat ’s what I t hought .
m e010 [ s^ bu] : So act ion he act ion here m eans dia uh speech ac uh
y ou know dialogue act .
m n048 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
m n015 [ b] : Mm m .

m n048 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , in t hat [ disfm arker] in t hat sense
m n048 [ s^ aa] : y es ,
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m n048 [ s^ m ] : dialogue act ,
m n048 [ b.%] : y eah .
m e010 [ fh|s] : Um , I t hink t ha I t hink it ’s not going t o [ disfm arker] I
t hink t hat ’s not going t o be good enough .
m e010 [ s] : I I don what uh [ disfm arker] what I m eant by t hat .
m e010 [ s] : So I t hink t he idea of having a , you know , t ransit ion
diagram for t he gram m ar of conversat ions is a good idea .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ f] : OK ?
m e010 [ s] : And I t hink t hat we do hav definit ely have t o get in on it
and find out [ disfm arker] OK .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : But I t hink t hat um
m e010 [ s] : when [ disfm arker] so , when y ou get t o t he t ourist dom ain
it ’s not just an inform at ion ret rieval syst em .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m n048 [ s^ aa] : Clearly .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So t his i t his is where I t hink t his [ disfm arker]
m n048 [ b] : Yes .
m e010 [ s] : people are gonna have t o t hink t his t hrough a bit m ore
carefully .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So , if it ’s only like in [ disfm arker] in t he [ disfm arker] in
t he film and T V t hing ,
m e010 [ s] : OK , you can do t his .
m e010 [ s] : And y ou just get inform at ion and give it t o people .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : But what happens when you act ually get t hem m oving
and so fort h and so on
m n048 [ b] : Yep .
m e010 [ s] : Uh , y y your [ disfm arker] I d I t hink t he not ion of t his as a
self cont ained uh m odule
m e010 [ s] : you know t h t he funct ional m odule t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
int eract s wit h [ disfm arker] wit h where t he t ourism g st uff is going
[ com m ent ] probably is t oo rest rict ive .
m n048 [ s^ aa.%] : Yep .
m e010 [ s] : Now I dunno how m uch people have t hought ahead t o t he
t ourist dom ain in t his
m n048 [ s] : Probably not enough ,
m n048 [ s.%−−] : I m ean an [ disfm arker] anot her uh m ore basic point
t here is t hat t he current um t asks and t herefore t h t he concept s in
t his ac
m n048 [ s] : what ’s called t he act ion plan and what ’s really t he
dialogue m anager .

m e010 [ b] : Yeah
m n048 [ h|s] : um is based on slot s t hat have t o be filled
m n048 [ s] : and t he um kind of v alues in t hese slot s would be fixed
t hings like t he a t im e or a m ovie t it le or som et hing like t his
m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m n048 [ s] : whereas in t he a um t ourist dom ain it m ight be an ent ire
rout e .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Indeed .
m n048 [ s] : Set − based , or even v ery com plex st ruct ured inform at ion
in t hese slot s
m e010 [ fg] : Right .
m n048 [ s^ no] : and I ’m not sure if [ disfm arker] if com plex slot s of t hat
t y pe are really um being t aken int o considerat ion .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ qy ^ t 3] : Could you [ disfm arker] could you put a m essage int o
t he right place t o see if we can at least ask t hat quest ion ?
m n048 [ s.%−−] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s really som et hing we
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ %−] : rea
m n048 [ s] : I m ean not hing ’s being com plet ely set t led t here
m n015 [ s^ bk] : yep
m n048 [ s] : so t his is really an ongoing discussion
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m
m n015 [ fg|s.%−−] : yeah and um it m ight act ually
m n048 [ s.%−] : and t hat ’s
m n015 [ s^ bk] : OK
m n015 [ s] : ah also [ disfm arker] because um again in in Deep Map we
have faced and im plem ent ed t hose problem s once already
m n015 [ s] : m ay be we can even shuffle som e know how from t here t o
t o Markus and Michael .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n048 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m n048 [ b.%] : Yep .
m n015 [ h|s.%−−] : And um m m m You don’t know [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ %−−] : OK t h
m n015 [ s^ cc] : I ’ll [ disfm arker] I ’ll t alk t o Michael
m n015 [ s] : it ’s what I do anyway .
m n015 [ qw.%−−] : Who [ disfm arker] How far is t he uh t he [ disfm arker]
t he M − t hree − L specificat ion for [ disfm arker] for t he la nat ural
language input gone on t he [ disfm arker] t he uh
m n015 [ s] : I haven’t seen anyt hing for t he uh t ourist pat h dom ain .
m n047 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not defined yet .
m n015 [ s^ bu] : And um you are probably also involved in t hat ,

m n047 [ s^ aa] : Um [ disfm arker] Yeah .
m n015 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n015 [ s] : uh t oget her wit h t he usual gang ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : um Pet ra and Jan
m n047 [ x ] : Mm m .
m n047 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , t here ’s a m eet ing next next week I t hink
m n015 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : OK because That ’s [ disfm arker] Those are t he
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qo] : I t hink t he [ disfm arker] t he t rue key issues is how does
t he what ev er com es out of t he language input pipeline look like
m n015 [ qo] : and t hen what t he act ion planner does wit h it
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qo] : and how t hat is uh specified .
m n015 [ s] : I didn’t t hink of t he int ernal working of t he uh t he act ion
planner and t he language [ disfm arker] uh t he funct ion m odel as sort
of relev ant .
m n015 [ s] : Because what [ disfm arker] what t hey t ake is sort of t his
[ disfm arker] t his fixed represent at ion of a [ disfm arker] of an int ent ion .
m n015 [ s] : And t hat can be as det ailed or as crude as you want it t o
be .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : But um t he int ernal workings of of t he [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : whet her you know t here ’re dialogue [ disfm arker] act ion
planners t hat work wit h belief − net s t hat are act ion planners t hat work
wit h y ou know st at e aut om at a .
m n015 [ s] : So t hat shouldn’t really m at t er t oo m uch .
m n015 [ s] : I m ean it does m at t er
m n015 [ s^ df.%−−] : because it does have t o keep t rack of you
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : we are on part six of r a rout e t hat consist s of eight st eps
and so fort h
m e010 [ fg|s^ aa] : Yeah , t h t here [ disfm arker] t here [ disfm arker] I
t hink t here are a lot of reasons why it m at t ers .
m n048 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ,
m e010 [ s.%−−] : so t hat
m e010 [ fh] : uh ,
m e010 [ s] : for ex am ple , t he i it ’s t he act ion planner is going t o t ake
som e spec and s m ake som e suggest ions about what t he user should
do .
m e010 [ s] : What t he user says aft er t hat is going t o be very m uch
caught up wit h what t he act ion planner t old it .
m n048 [ b.%] : Yes .
m e010 [ s^ rt .%−−] : If t he [ disfm arker] If t he parser and t he language
end doesn’t know what t he person ’s been t old
m e010 [ s^ f^ rt ] : OK

m e010 [ s] : t h it ’s you ’re m aking your life m uch m ore difficult t han it
has t o be .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e010 [ s] : So if som eone says t he best t t o uh go t here is by t axi ,
m e010 [ s] : let ’s say .
m e010 [ s] : Now t he planner com es out and says you wanna get t here
fast ,
m e010 [ s] : t ake a t axi .
m e010 [ s^ f] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : And t he language end doesn’t know t hat .
m e010 [ s] : OK , t here ’s all sort s of dialogues t hat won’t m ake any
sense which would be just fine .
m n048 [ fg.%] : hm m
m e010 [ fh] : uh
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n048 [ s.%−−] : That would
m n048 [ s] : b but t hat [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat [ disfm arker] t hat uh
point has been realized
m n048 [ s] : and it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not really um been defined yet
m n048 [ s] : but t here ’s gonna be som e kind of feedback and input
from uh t he act ion planner int o all t he analysis m odules , t elling t hem
what t o ex pect and what t he current st at e of t he discourse is .
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m n048 [ s] : Bey ond what ’s current ly being im plem ent ed which is just
word list s .
m e010 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , but t his is not t he st t his is not just t he st at e
of t he discourse .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n048 [ s^ 2^ t 1] : Of [ disfm arker] of special int erest .
m e010 [ s] : This is act ually t he st at e of t he plan .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : That ’s why
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n048 [ b] : Yes , Yes , Mm − hm m yeah .
m e010 [ fh] : OK so it [ disfm arker] z
m e010 [ fg] : and s
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : uh , It ’s great if people are already t aking t hat int o
account .
m e010 [ s] : But One would hav e t have t o see [ disfm arker] see t he
det ails .
m n048 [ s] : The specifics aren’t really t here yet .
m n048 [ b.%] : Yes .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m n048 [ s] : So , t here ’s work t o do t here .
m e010 [ s] : So any way , Robert , t hat ’s why I was t hinking t hat
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e010 [ fh] : um
m e010 [ s^ rt .%−−] : I t hink you ’re gonna need [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : We t alked about t his several t im es t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he input end is gonna need a fair
am ount of feedback from t he planning end .
m n048 [ b] : hm m
m e010 [ s] : In [ disfm arker] in one of t hese t hings which are
[ disfm arker] are m uch m ore cont inuous t han t he [ disfm arker] just t he
dialogue ov er m ovies and st uff .
m n048 [ b] : Yeah .
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m n048 [ s] : And even on [ disfm arker] on a m ore basic level t he
[ disfm arker] t he act ion planner act ually needs t o be able t o have um
an expressive power t hat can deal wit h t hese st ruct ures .
m e010 [ qw^ br^ rt ] : Hm m ?
m n048 [ s] : And not just um say um [ disfm arker] um t he dialogue um
will consist of t en possible st at es and t h t hese st at es really are fixed in
[ disfm arker] in a cert ain sense .
m e010 [ qy] : Would t here be any chance of get t ing t he t erm inology
changed so t hat t he dialogue planner was called a " dialogue planner
"?
m n048 [ s.%−] : You have t o [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : Because t here ’s t his ot her t hing The o There ’s t his ot her
t hing in [ disfm arker] in t he t ourist dom ain which is gonna be a rout e
planner
m n048 [ s^ aa] : That ’d be nice .
m e010 [ s] : or [ disfm arker] It ’s really gonna be an act ion planner .
m e010 [ fh] : And [ com m ent ] i it [ disfm arker]
m n048 [ s] : It ought a be called a [ disfm arker] a dialogue m anager .
m n048 [ s] : cuz t hat ’s what everybody else calls it .
m e010 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : I would t hink ,
m e010 [ b] : yeah .
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ qw^ br] : Huh ?
m n048 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ qw^ cs] : So , s So what would happen if we sent a not e saying
" Gee we ’ve t alked about t his and couldn’t we change t his uh t h t he
whole word ? "
m e010 [ s^ df^ no] : I have no idea how com plicat ed t hese t hings are .
m n015 [ s] : Probably close t o im possible .
m n048 [ s^ arp] : Depends on who you t alk t o how .
m n048 [ s^ cc] : We ’ll see .
m n048 [ s^ cc] : I ’ll go check ,
m n048 [ s^ df] : cause I com plet ely agree .
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m n048 [ fh] : Yeah ,

m n048 [ s] : and I t hink t his is just for hist orical reasons wit hin uh , t he
preparat ion phase of t he project
m n048 [ s] : and not because som ebody act ually believes it ought t o
be act ion planner .
m n048 [ s] : So if t here is resist ance against changing it , t hat ’s just
because " Oh , We don’t want t o change t hings . "
m n048 [ s.%−−] : That [ disfm arker] t hat not deep reason
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e010 [ s^ t .%−−] : anyway .
m e010 [ s] : I if [ disfm arker] if t hat c in persist s t hen we ’re gonna need
anot her t erm . for t he t hing t hat act ually does t he planning of t he uh

m n015 [ s] : That ’s ext ernal serv ices .
m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ ar.%−−] : Yeah , but t hat ’s not g eh t ha
m e010 [ s^ ng] : That ha has all t he wrong connot at ions .
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : it ’s [ disfm arker] it sounds like it ’s you know st and
alone .
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : It doesn’t int eract ,
m e010 [ s.%−−] : it doesn’t
m e010 [ s] : That ’s why I ’m saying .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : I t hink you can’t [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ ba] : it ’s fine for looking up when T you know when t he

[ disfm arker] t hat has a lot of st at e ,

m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ fg|s] : Yeah I t hink just t he [ disfm arker] t he spat ial planner

m n048 [ b] : Hm m
m n015 [ s] : It ’s really insane .

m n048 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , Marcus .
m n015 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Markus
m n015 [ qy^ rt .%−−] : Is he new in t he [ disfm arker] in t he ?
m n048 [ qw.%−] : Wh − where ’s ?
m n048 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , he ’s [ disfm arker] he st art ed um I t hink
January .
m n047 [ b] : Yeah .
m n048 [ s] : And he ’s gonna be responsible for t he im plem ent at ion of
t his act ion planner .
m n048 [ s^ bsc] : Dialogue m anager .
m n015 [ qy] : Is he gonna cont inue wit h t he old [ disfm arker] uh
[ disfm arker] t hing ?
m n048 [ s^ ar] : No ,
m n048 [ s^ ar^ r|s] : no he ’s com plet ely gonna rewrit e every t hing . In

m n015 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n048 [ s^ ba] : OK so t hat ’s int erest ing .
m n015 [ s^ aa|s] : Yes I was just [ disfm arker] t hat ’s m y next quest ion
m n048 [ b.x] : hm m
m n015 [ s] : whet her we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re gonna st ick t o Prolog or
not .
m n048 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n048 [ s^ ar^ m |s] : No , t hat ’s gonna be phased out .
m e010 [ b.x] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : OK
m n015 [ s] : But I do t hink t he [ disfm arker] t he funct ion m odeling
concept has a cert ain [ disfm arker] m akes sense in a [ disfm arker] in a
cert ain light
m n048 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : because t he act ion planner should not be [ disfm arker] or
t he dialogue m anager in t hat case should not um w have t o worry
about whet her it ’s int erfacing wit h um som et hing t hat does rout e
planning in t his way or t hat way
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : I I t ot ally agree .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m n015 [ qw^ br^ rt ] : huh ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : it j
m e010 [ s^ r] : Yeah I [ disfm arker] I agree .
m e010 [ s] : There is [ disfm arker] t here ’s a logic t o dialogue which
[ disfm arker] which is [ disfm arker] is separable .
m e010 [ %−] : I
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : and it [ disfm arker] cant [ disfm arker] sort of form ulat e it s
what it want s in a [ disfm arker] in a rat her a abst ract uh way ,
m n015 [ s] : y ou know f " Find m e a good rout e for t his . "

m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : It doesn’t really hav e t o worry ab how rout e planner A or
how rout e planner B act ually want s it .
m n015 [ s] : So t his is [ disfm arker] seem ed like a good idea .
m n015 [ s] : In t he beginning .
m e010 [ s] : It ’s t ricky .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : It ’s t ricky because one could well im agine [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : I t hink it will t urn out t o be t he case t hat uh , t his t hing we
’re t alking about , t h t he ext ended n uh knowledge m odeler will fill in
som e param et ers about what t he person want s .
m e010 [ s] : One could well im agine t hat t he next t hing t hat ’s t rying t o
fill out t he det ailed uh , rout e planning , let ’s say , will also have
quest ions t hat it would like t o ask t he user .
m e010 [ s] : You could well im agine you get t o a point where it ’s got a
[ disfm arker] a choice t o m ake and it just doesn’t know som et hing .
m e010 [ s] : And so y you would like it t also be able t o uh form ulat e a
query .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : And t o run t hat back t hrough uh . t he dialogue m anager
and t o t he out put m odule and back around .
m n015 [ b] : hm m
m e010 [ s] : And a I a a good design would [ disfm arker] would allow
t hat t o happen .
m n015 [ s^ 2.%−−] : a lot of ,
m n015 [ b] : yeah
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ s] : If [ disfm arker] if you know if [ disfm arker] if you can’t m ake
it happen t hen you [ disfm arker] you do your best .
m n048 [ s^ aap^ rt ] : Yeah
m n048 [ s] : but t hat doesn’t necessarily cont radict um an archit ect ure
where t here really is a pers a def well − defined int erface .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : I t ot ally agree .
m n048 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker] and
m e010 [ s.%−−] : But [ disfm arker] but what it nee
m e010 [ s.%−−] : but t h what t he point is t he
m e010 [ s] : in t hat case t he dialogue m anager is sort of event driven .
m e010 [ s] : So t he dialogue m anager m ay t hink it ’s in a dialogue st at e
of one sort ,
m e010 [ s:s] : and t his [ disfm arker] one of t hese planning m odules
com es along and says " hey , right now we need t o ask a quest ion " .
m n048 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : So t hat forces t he dialogue m anager t o change st at e .
m n048 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : Yes
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s.%−] : It could be y
m n048 [ s^ bk] : Sure ,

m n048 [ fg|s] : y e yeah I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s
t he um concept t hat people have ,
m e010 [ fg|%−] : Yeah , yeah it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n048 [ s^ bk] : yep .
m n048 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and t he [ disfm arker] t he underlying idea
of course is t hat t here is som et hing like kernel m odules wit h kernel
funct ionalit y t hat y ou can plug uh cert ain applicat ions like t ourist
inform at ion or um t he hom e scenario wit h uh cont rolling a VCR and so
on .
m n048 [ s] : And t hen ext end it t o an arbit rary num ber of applicat ions
ev ent ually .
m n048 [ qy .%−−] : So [ disfm arker] wouldn’t
m n048 [ s] : That ’s an addit ional reason t o have t his well − defined
int erface
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Oh , yeah , yeah .
m n048 [ s] : and keep t hese t hings like uh t ourist inform at ion ext ernal .
m n048 [ s] : And t hen call it ext ernal services .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
m n048 [ s.%−] : But of course t he [ disfm arker] t he m ore com plex
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ fg|s] : Yeah , t here is anot her philosophical issue t hat I t hink
y ou know you can [ disfm arker] evade
m n048 [ b] : y ep .
m n015 [ s] : but , at at least it m akes sense t o m e t hat sooner or lat er
uh [ disfm arker] a service is gonna com e and describe it self t o you .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : and t hat ’s sort of what Srini is working on in
[ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in t he DAML uh project where um you
[ disfm arker] you find a GIS about [ disfm arker] t hat gives you
inform at ion on Berkeley ,
m n048 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : and it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s gonna be t here and t ell you what
it can do and how it want s t o do t hings .
m n015 [ s] : and so y ou can act ually int erface t o such a syst em wit hout
ev er hav ing m et it before
m n015 [ s] : and t he funct ion m odeler and a self − descript ion of t he um
ex t ernal service haggle it out
m n048 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ s] : and you can use t he sam e language core , underst anding
core t o int erface wit h planner − A , planner − B , planner − C and so fort h
.
m n048 [ b] : Hm m .
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : Which is , you know , uh [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker]
ut opian [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : com plet ely ut opian at t he m om ent ,

m n015 [ s] : but slowly , you know , get t ing int o t he realm of t he uh
cont ingent .
m n048 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : But we are facing of course m uch m ore um realist ic
problem s .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : And language input for exam ple , is of course uh crucial
y ou know also when you do t he sort of deep underst anding analysis
t hat we envision .
m n015 [ fh|s.%−−] : um Then of course , t he uh um , you know
m n015 [ qo] : what is it [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : povert y of t he st im ulus ,
m n015 [ s] : yet t he m uh t he less we get of t hat t he bet t er .
m n015 [ fh|qo] : and um so we [ disfm arker] we ’re t hinking , for
ex am ple how m uch synt act ic analysis act ually happens already in t he
parser .
m n047 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : and whet her one could int erface t o t hat pot ent ially
m n047 [ fg] : Yeah ,
m n047 [ qy.%−−] : are t here current ly is uh
m n047 [ s^ rt ] : no synt act ic analysis
m n047 [ s] : but in t he next release t here will be som e .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
m e010 [ qw.%−−] : How ’s it [ disfm arker]
m n047 [ s.%−−] : unless
m n047 [ s.%−−] : and it ’s
m n047 [ fg] : um uh
m n047 [ s.%−−] : you can access t his
m e010 [ fg|s] : S so uh y we [ disfm arker] we looked at t he e current
pat t ern m at ching t hing .
m n047 [ s^ aa] : Hm m .
m e010 [ s] : And as you say it ’s just a surface pat t ern m at cher .
m e010 [ qw] : Uh , So what are [ disfm arker] what are t he plans roughly
?
m n047 [ h|s^ rt ] : um it ’s t o [ disfm arker] t o int egrat e and synt act ic
analy sis .
m n047 [ s^ rt ] : and um add som e m ore feat ures like segm ent at ion .
m n047 [ s^ rt ] : So t hen an ut t er m ore t han one ut t erance is
[ disfm arker] There um t here ’s oft en uh pause bet ween it
m n047 [ s] : and a segm ent at ion occurs .
m e010 [ s.%−] : So , t he um [ disfm arker]
m n047 [ fh] : um
m e010 [ s^ bu.%−−] : So t he idea is t o uh [ disfm arker] have a pa y y a
part icular [ disfm arker]
m n047 [ b] : y eah
m e010 [ qy^ rt ] : Do you have a part icular parser in m ind ?
m e010 [ qy .%−−] : Is it uh [ disfm arker] part ic d

m e010 [ qy .%−−] : I m ean have y ou t hought t hrough [ disfm arker] ?
m e010 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is it an HPSG parser ?
m e010 [ qrr^ rt ] : Is it a what ev er ?
m n047 [ s^ ar|s.%−−] : No [ disfm arker] no it ’s [ disfm arker] uh I t hink it ’s
it ’s t ot ally com plicat ed for
m n047 [ s] : it ’s just one [ disfm arker] one person
m e010 [ fg] : OK .
m n047 [ s.%−] : and so I have t o keep t he [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ bu] : Oh , you have t o do it .
m e010 [ s^ bk^ r] : You have t o do it ,
m e010 [ b] : y eah .
m n047 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n047 [ s] : ah and so [ vocalsound] t hings m ust be sim pler
m e010 [ s^ bk] : I see ,
m e010 [ %−] : so
m n047 [ s] : but uh , Miel synt act ic analysis wit h um finit e st at e
t ransducers .
m e010 [ s.%−] : But t he people at D F
m e010 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s] : People at DFKI have writ t en a fair num ber of parsers .
m e010 [ s] : Ot her [ disfm arker] you know , people over t he years . uh
have writ t en various parsers at DFKI .
m e010 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : None of t hem are suit able ?
m e010 [ s^ df] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I d I ’m asking .
m e010 [ s^ df^ no] : I don’t know .
m n047 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , uh t he problem is t h t hat it has t o be very fast
m n047 [ s.%−−] : because um if you want t o for m ore t han one pat h
anywhere
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n047 [ qo] : what ’s in t he lat ches from t he speech recognizer
m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n047 [ s] : so it ’s speed is crucial .
m n047 [ fh] : uh
m n047 [ s] : And t hey are not fast enough .
m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n047 [ s] : And t hey also have t o be very robust . cuz of um speech
recognit ion errors
m n047 [ %−−] : and
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ fg|s] : So , um [ disfm arker] So t here was a chunk parser in
Verbm obil , t hat was one of t he uh branchers .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : You know t hey [ disfm arker] d t h I c
m e010 [ s] : There were t hese various uh , com pet ing uh synt ax
m odules .
m e010 [ s] : And I know one of t hem was a chunk parser
m e010 [ s] : and I don’t rem em ber [ pause] who did t hat .

m n047 [ s.%−−] : I t hink it ’s t hat
m n015 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : A Alan ?
m n047 [ s.%−−] : m ight ,
m n047 [ s] : at Tuebingen I t hought .
m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ no] : Yeah I d I don’t rem em ber .
m n047 [ qy ] : was [ disfm arker] Do you know som et hing about t hat ?
m n048 [ s] : Tubingen was at least involved in put t ing t he chunks
t oget her
m n047 [ %−] : In Tub − at [ disfm arker]
m n048 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] can’t quit e recall whet her t hey act ually
produced t he chunks in t he first place .
m n047 [ s^ bk] : oh
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Uh . I see .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , t hat ’s right .
m n048 [ %−] : Or wh
m e010 [ s.%−−] : There w
m n047 [ s] : Oh from [ disfm arker] from St ut t gart ,
m e010 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right .
m e010 [ s] : They w They had [ disfm arker] There were [ disfm arker] This
was done wit h a t wo phase t hing , where [ com m ent ] t he chunk parser
it self was pret t y st upid
m n047 [ fg|%−] : y eah , also
m e010 [ s] : and t hen t here was a kind of t rying t o fit t hem t oget her
t hat h used m ore cont ext .
m n048 [ b] : Right .
m n048 [ b] : Yeah
m e010 [ b] : Right ?
m n048 [ fg|s] : Well you s and [ disfm arker] and especially you did som e
[ disfm arker] som e
m n048 [ fh] : um , l um
m n048 [ s] : was a learning − based approach which learned from a big
corpus of [ disfm arker] of t rees .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n047 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m n048 [ s] : And y es t he [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] t he chunk parser
was a finit e − st at e m achine t hat um Mark Light originally w worked on
in [ disfm arker] while he was in Tuebingen
m n048 [ s] : and t hen som ebody else in Tuebingen picked t hat up . So
it was done in Tuebingen ,
m n048 [ b] : y eah .
m n048 [ b] : Definit ely .
m e010 [ qy^ rt .%−−] : But is t hat t he kind of t hing y
m e010 [ s] : It sounds like t he kind of t hing t hat you were t hinking of .
m n047 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
m n048 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah I guess it ’s sim ilar .

m n047 [ s^ aa] : y eah
m n047 [ s] : t hat ’s In t his direct ion ,
m n047 [ s^ aa] : yes
m e010 [ qw^ br] : What ?
m n047 [ s^ r] : Yeah , it ’s in [ disfm arker] in t his direct ion .
m e010 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ %−−] : The [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : From Michael St rube , I ’ve heard very good st uff about t he
chunk parser t hat is done by FORWISS ,
m n015 [ s] : uh , which is in em bassy doing t he parsing .
m n048 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : So t his is sort of [ disfm arker] cam e as a surprise t o m e
t hat y ou know , em bassy s [ com m ent ] is feat uring a nice parser
m n015 [ s] : but it ’s [ pause] what I hear . One could also look at t hat
and see whet her t here is som e synergy possible .
m n047 [ b] : Mm − hm m , yeah ,
m n047 [ s^ ba] : it would be very int erest ing ,
m n047 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n047 [ b] : Mm m , y eah .
m n015 [ s] : And t hey ’re doing chunk parsing
m n015 [ s.%−−] : and it ’s uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I can give you t he nam es of t he people who
do it t here .
m n015 [ fh] : But um .
m n015 [ s] : Then t here is of course m ore ways of parsing t hings .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Of course .
m e010 [ s^ arp] : But [ disfm arker] But uh given t h t he const raint s , t hat
y ou want it t o be sm all and fast and so fort h , m y guess is you ’re
probably int o som e kind of chunk parsing .
m e010 [ s] : And uh I ’m not a big believer in t his um st at ist ical you
know , cleaning up
m e010 [ fh] : uh
m e010 [ s] : It [ disfm arker] That seem s t o m e kind of a last resort if uh
y ou can’t do it any ot her way .
m e010 [ fh] : uh
m e010 [ s^ no] : but I dunno .
m e010 [ s] : It m ay [ disfm arker] i i m ay be t hat ’s what you guys finally
decide do .
m n047 [ b] : Hm m .
m e010 [ fh] : Uh .
m e010 [ qy.%−] : And have you looked [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : uh just [ disfm arker] again for cont ext [ disfm arker]
m n047 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : There is t his [ disfm arker] t his one t hat t hey did at SRI
som e years ago [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : Fast us ?

m n047 [ h] : um
m e010 [ %−] : a [ disfm arker]
m n047 [ s^ aa|s] : y eah , I ’ve [ disfm arker] I ’ve looked at it
m n047 [ s^ df] : but [ disfm arker] but it ’s no [ disfm arker] not m uch uh
inform at ion available .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : ah !
m n047 [ s.%−−] : I found ,
m n047 [ s] : but it ’s also finit e − st at e t ransducers , I t hought .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : It is .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s] : I m ean [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it was pret t y
am bit ious .
m n047 [ s.%−−] : and
m e010 [ s] : And of course it was English orient ed ,
m e010 [ fh] : um w
m n047 [ fg|s^ df.%−−] : Yeah , and [ disfm arker] and Purely finit e − st at e
t ransducers are not so good for Germ an since t here ’s um
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ fg|s] : Yeah , I guess t hat ’s t he point is [ disfm arker] is all t he
m orphology and st uff .
m n047 [ s] : The word order is [ disfm arker] is uh not fixed
m e010 [ s] : And English is all t h all word order .
m e010 [ s] : And it m akes a lot m ore sense .
m n047 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker] e
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , OK .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : Good point .
m e010 [ s.%−] : So in [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in Germ an you ’ve got
uh m ost of t his done wit h
m n047 [ s] : Mm − hm m . Also it ’s uh [ disfm arker] it ’s um [ disfm arker]
Yes , uh t he um choice bet ween uh t his processing and t hat
processing and m y t em plat e m at cher .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ qw.%−−] : So what about
m n047 [ x] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e010 [ fh] : Um
m e010 [ qy.%−−] : Did y
m e010 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : like Morfix ?
m e010 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : a a e y you ’ve got st em m ers ?
m e010 [ qrr.%−] : Or is t hat som et hing t hat [ disfm arker]
m n047 [ h|s] : Um , yeah but it ’s all in t he [ disfm arker] in t he lexicon .
m e010 [ qy ^ rt ] : But did you have t hat ?
m n047 [ s.%−−] : So it ’s [ disfm arker]
m n047 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah t h t he inform at ion is available .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m e010 [ s] : I see .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So , but [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : So y you just connect t o t he lexicon
m n047 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
m n047 [ s^ aa] : Yeah
m e010 [ fh] : and uh
m e010 [ s^ bu] : at least for Germ an you have all [ disfm arker] all of t he
[ disfm arker] uh t he st em m ing inform at ion .
m n047 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : Yeah , we can ,
m n047 [ b] : oh yeah .
m n047 [ s] : We hav e knowledge bases from [ disfm arker] from

m e010 [ b] : Yep .
m n047 [ %−−] : and so .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : But it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it doesn’t look like i
y ou ’re using it .
m e010 [ s] : I didn’t n see it being used in t he current t em plat e uh
parser .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] I didn’t see any Uh [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : of course we l act ually only looked at t he English .
m n047 [ %−] : It [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ qy ^ rt ^ t 1] : Did we look at t he Germ an ?
m n047 [ h] : um
m e010 [ s^ no^ t 1] : I don’t rem em ber .
m e010 [ qw.%−] : So w wha
m n047 [ fg|s] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker] but it ’s used for [ disfm arker] for
st em form s .
m n048 [ s] : n Well I t hink [ disfm arker] I t hink t here ’s som e
m isunderst anding here
m e010 [ %−] : i
m n047 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n048 [ s] : it ’s [ disfm arker] Morphix is not used on − line .
m n048 [ s] : s so t he lexicon m ight be deriv ed by Morphix
m n047 [ qw.%] : What ?
m n048 [ s] : but What [ disfm arker] what ’s happening on − line is just
um um a [ disfm arker] a ret rieval from t he lexicon which would give all
t he st em m ing inform at ion
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m n047 [ b] : Hm m .
m n048 [ s] : so it would be a full foreign lexicon .
m e010 [ s^ bu] : And t hat ’s what you have .
m n047 [ s^ aa] : Yeah
m n048 [ s^ aa.%] : Yep .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m e010 [ qw.%−] : What [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−] : uh I didn’t rem e
m n015 [ s] : We t hrew out all t he form s .
m e010 [ qw^ br] : Huh ?
m n015 [ s^ r] : We t hrew out all t he form s
m n015 [ s^ df] : because , you know , English ,
m n015 [ %−−] : well [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Oh OK ,
m e010 [ s.%−−] : so it [ disfm arker] yeah , s s I t hought I ’d [ disfm arker]
m n047 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ qr^ d] : So in Germ an t hen you act ually do case m at ching and
t hings like in t he [ disfm arker] in t he pat t ern m at cher or not ?
m n047 [ h|s] : um Not yet but it ’s planned t o do t hat .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ df] : Cuz I r I didn’t rem e I didn’t t hink I saw it .
m e010 [ qw] : Have we looked at t he Germ an ?
m n047 [ b] : Yeah
m e010 [ s.%−−] : Oh , I haven
m e010 [ b] : y eah
m e010 [ s^ ba] : t hat ’s [ disfm arker] get t ing it from t he lexicon is just
fine .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah , y eah , yeah .
m n048 [ b] : Sure ,
m n047 [ b] : Oh y es .
m n048 [ b] : right .
m e010 [ s] : No problem wit h t hat .
m e010 [ fg] : um
m e010 [ fg|s] : Yeah and here ’s t he case where t he English and t he
Germ an m ight really be significant ly different .
m e010 [ s] : In t erm s of if you ’re t rying t o build som e fast parser and
so fort h
m e010 [ fh.%] : and [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ cs] : You really m ight wanna do it in a significant ly different
way .
m e010 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m e010 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : So you ’ve [ disfm arker] you guys have looked at t his
?
m e010 [ qy ^ g^ rt ] : also ?
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : in t erm s of You know , w if you ’re doing t his for English
as well as Germ an
m e010 [ fh|qy^ rt ] : Um Do you t hink now t hat it would be t his
[ disfm arker] doing it sim ilarly ?
m n047 [ h|s^ aa] : um Yeah ,
m n047 [ s.%−−] : it ’s um I t hink it ’s um
m n047 [ s^ aa|s] : y es , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s um possible t o
[ disfm arker] t o do list processing .

m n047 [ s^ rt ] : and Maybe t his is um m ore adequat e for English
m n047 [ s] : and in Germ an um set processing is used .
m e010 [ s^ 2] : Set .
m n047 [ s.%−−] : May be yeah .
m n047 [ s] : Som e ex t ensions uh have t o be m ade . For [ disfm arker] for
a English version
m e010 [ b.%] : Mm m .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : Int erest ing .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : Not easy .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : Well t here ’s m I ’m sure t here ’s gonna be m ore
discussion on t hat aft er your t alk .
m n047 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m ,
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m n047 [ b] : y eah .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : We ’re just gonna foreshadow what we saw t hat
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ fh] : and um
m e010 [ s.%−−] : Now act ually ,
m e010 [ fh] : um
m e010 [ qw^ rt ] : Are you guys free at five ?
m e010 [ qrr^ rt ] : Or [ disfm arker] Do you have t o go som ewhere at five
o ’ clock t onight ?
m e010 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : W in t en m inut es ?
m n047 [ h] : Ah [ disfm arker]
m n047 [ s^ ar] : m m m . No .
m n048 [ %−−] : uh [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] I t hink we ’re ex pect
[ disfm arker]
m n047 [ qy^ rt ] : Oder t here was an [ disfm arker] t alk ?
m n048 [ s^ aa|s^ na^ rt ] : Yeah , t here [ disfm arker] t here ’s t he um
pract ice t alk .
m n047 [ b] : uh Mm m , yeah .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Great .
m e010 [ s^ bu] : So y ou ’re going t o t hat .
m n048 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s what we were
planning t o do .
m e010 [ s] : That ’s good , because t hat will uh t ell you a fair am ount
about The form of sem ant ic const ruct ion gram m ar t hat we ’re using .
m n048 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : so [ disfm arker] So I t h I t hink t hat probably as good an
int roduct ion as y ou ’ll get .
m n048 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m n047 [ b] : Ah .
m e010 [ s] : Uh t o t he form of [ disfm arker] of uh [ disfm arker]
concept ual gram m ar t hat [ disfm arker] t hat w we have in m ind for t his .
m n047 [ b] : Mm m , ah .

m e010 [ s] : It won’t t alk part icularly about how t hat relat es t o what uh
Robert was say ing at t he beginning .
m e010 [ s] : But let m e give you a very short version of t his .
m e010 [ s] : So we t alked about t he fact t hat There ’re going t o be a
cert ain num ber of decisions That you want t he knowledge m odeler t o
m ake , t hat will be t hen fed t o t he funct ion m odule , t hat does uh ,
rout e planning .
m e010 [ s] : It ’s called t he " rout e planner " or som et hing .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : So t here are t hese decisions .
m e010 [ s] : And t hen one half of t his we t alked about at lit t le bit is how
if y ou had t he right inform at ion ,
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : if you knew som et hing about what was said
m e010 [ qo] : and about t h t he som et hing about was t he agent a
t ourist or a nat iv e or a business person
m e010 [ s^ e] : or uh young or old ,
m e010 [ s] : what ever .
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : That inform at ion ,
m e010 [ s.%−−] : and also about t he
m e010 [ s] : Uh , what we ’re calling " t he ent it y " ,
m e010 [ qo^ e] : Is it a cast le ,
m e010 [ qo^ e] : is it a bank ?
m e010 [ qo^ e] : Is it a s t own square ,
m e010 [ qo^ e] : is it a st at ue ?
m e010 [ s] : What ever .
m e010 [ s] : So all t hat kind of inform at ion could be com bined int o
decision net works and give you decisions .
m e010 [ qo] : But t he ot her half of t he problem is How would you get
t hat kind of inform at ion from t he parsed input ?
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So , um
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So what you m ight t ry t o do is just build m ore
t em plat es , saying uh
m e010 [ s.%−−] : we ’re t rying t o build a t em pl
m e010 [ s] : y ou know build a t em plat e t hat w uh som ehow would
capt ure t he fact t hat he want s t o t ake a pict ure .
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ?
m e010 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and we could [ disfm arker] you could do
t his .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : And it ’s a sm all enough dom ain t hat probably you , you
know [ disfm arker]
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ b] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : You could do t his .
m e010 [ s] : But uh from our point of v iew t his is also a research project

m e010 [ s] : and t here are a couple of people not here for various
reasons who are doing doct oral dissert at ions on t his ,
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : and t he idea t hat we ’re really aft er is a very deep
sem ant ics based on cognit ive linguist ics
m e010 [ s] : and t he not ion t hat t here are a relat ively sm all num ber of
prim it iv e concept ual schem as t hat charact erize a lot of act ivit y .
m e010 [ s] : So a t y pical one in t his form ulat ion is a cont ainer .
m e010 [ s] : So t his is a st at ic t hing .
m e010 [ s] : And t he not ion is t hat all sort s of physical sit uat ions are
charact erized in t erm s of cont ainers .
m e010 [ s^ e.%−−] : Going in and out t he port als and con
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ b] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : But also , im port ant ly for Lakoff and t hese guys is all sort s
of m et aphorical t hings are also charact erized t his way .
m e010 [ s] : You get in t rouble and you know et cet era
m n047 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ %−−] : and so [ disfm arker] s
m e010 [ s] : So , what we ’re really t rying t o do is t o m ap from t he
discourse t o t he concept ual sem ant ics lev el .
m e010 [ s] : And from t here t o t he appropriat e decisions .
m e010 [ s] : So anot her one of t hese prim it ive , what are called " im age
schem as " , is uh goal seeking .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : So t his a not ion of a source , pat h , goal , t raject or ,
possibly obst acles .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : And t he idea is t his is anot her concept ual prim it ive .
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : And t hat all sort s of t hings , part icularly in t he t ourist
dom ain , can be represent ed in t erm s of uh source , pat h and goal .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : So t he idea would be could we build an analyser t hat
would t ake an ut t erance
m e010 [ s:s^ fe^ rt ] : and say " Aha !
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : t h t his ut t erance is t alking about an at t em pt t o reach a
goal .
m e010 [ s] : The goal is t his ,
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : t he pers t he , uh t raveller is t hat ,
m e010 [ fh] : uh
m e010 [ s.%−−] : t he sor w where we are at now is is t his ,
m e010 [ s] : t hey ’ve m ent ioned possible obst acles , et cet era . "
m e010 [ s] : So t h t he [ disfm arker] and t his is an [ disfm arker] again
at t em pt t o get very wide coverage .

m e010 [ s] : So if y ou can do t his , t hen t he not ion would be t hat
across a v ery large range of dom ains , you could use t his deep
concept ual basis as t he int erface .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : And t hen ,
m e010 [ fh] : uh
m e010 [ s] : The processing of t hat , bot h on t he input end ,
recognizing t hat cert ain words in a language t alk about cont ainers or
goals , et cet era ,
m e010 [ s] : and on t he out put end , given t his kind of inform at ion , you
can t hen uh m ake decisions about what act ions t o t ake .
m e010 [ s] : Prov ides , t hey claim , a very powerful , general not ion of
deep sem ant ics .
m e010 [ s] : So t hat ’s what we ’re really doing .
m n048 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ fh] : And
m e010 [ s.%−−] : Nancy is going t o [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : Her t alk is going t o be not about using t his in applicat ions
, but about m odeling how children m ight learn t his kind of uh deep
sem ant ic gram m ar .
m n048 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m n048 [ b.%] : Yep , yep .
m n048 [ qw] : And how do you envision um t he [ disfm arker] t he um t his
deep sem ant ic t o be worked wit h .
m n048 [ qy .%−−] : Would it be highly am biguous if
m n048 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : and t hen t here would be anot her m odule t hat
t akes t hat um highly underspecified deep sem ant ic const ruct ion
m n048 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : and m ap it ont o t he current cont ext t o find out
what t he person really was t alking about in t hat cont ext .
m e010 [ s] : Well t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s where
t he belief − net com es in .
m n048 [ s.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] or a [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So t h t he idea is ,
m e010 [ s] : let ’s t ake t his business about going t o t he Powder − Tower
.
m n048 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So part of what y ou ’ll get out of t his will be t he fact t ha
w
m e010 [ s.%−−] : if it works right ,
m e010 [ s] : OK , t hat t his is an agent t hat want s t o go t o t his place
m e010 [ s] : and t hat ’s t heir goal
m e010 [ s] : and t here will be addit ional sit uat ional inform at ion .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n048 [ b] : Oh , OK .
m e010 [ s^ f] : Uh , OK ,

m n048 [ %−] : t h
m e010 [ s] : part of it com es from t he ont ology .
m e010 [ s] : The t ower is t his kind of object .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n048 [ b] : Yeah , OK .
m e010 [ s] : Part of it com es from t he user m odel .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : And t he idea of t he belief − net is it com bines t he
inform at ion from t he dialogue which com es across in t his general way ,
m n048 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : you know t his is a [ disfm arker] t his is a goal seeking
behav ior , along wit h specific inform at ion from t he ont ology about t he
kinds of object s involved
m n048 [ b] : Yeah
m n048 [ b] : OK ,
m n048 [ b] : Yeah ,
m n048 [ b.%] : y ep y ep yep yep
m e010 [ s:qw] : and about t he sit uat ion about " Is it raining ? "
m e010 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m e010 [ s] : What ever it is .
m e010 [ s] : And so t hat ’s t he belief − net t hat we ’ve laid out .
m n048 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : And so t h t he coupling t o t he sit uat ion com es in t his
m odel from , at t h at t h at t he belief − net , com bining ev idence from
t he dialogue wit h t he ont ology wit h t he sit uat ion .
m n048 [ b] : Yeah .
m n047 [ b] : Hm m .
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : But Nancy isn’t gonna t alk about t hat ,
m n048 [ b] : Yeah ,
m e010 [ s.%−−] : just about t he um
m n048 [ b] : oh y eah ,
m n048 [ b] : I see ,
m n048 [ b] : yeah y eah , really .
m n015 [ s] : First st eps .
m e010 [ fh] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he const ruct ion gram m ar .
m n015 [ s] : And she ’s gonna st art
m n015 [ s^ e] : in a m inut e .
m e010 [ s] : In a m inut e .
m n047 [ s^ bk] : Ah , OK .
m e010 [ b] : OK .
m n036 [ qy.%−−] : Is it i in ,
m n036 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : t hen , your place , in five [ disfm arker] five − A ?
m n048 [ b] : Alright .
