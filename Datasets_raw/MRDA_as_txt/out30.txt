m e011 [ z] : I t hink it ’s act ually [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ z] : What is [ disfm arker] what is t hat ?
m e011 [ z] : it depends on if t he t em p files are t here or not ,
m e011 [ z] : t hat [ disfm arker] at least t hat ’s m y current working
hypot hesis ,
fe016 [ z] : Ah .
m e011 [ z] : t hat I t hink what happens is it t ries t o clear t he t em p files
and if t hey ’re t oo big , it crashes .
fe016 [ z] : Ah .
m e018 [ z] : When t he power went out t he ot her day and I rest art ed it ,
it crashed t he first t im e .
m e011 [ z] : Oh , t hat ’s right .
m e018 [ z] : Aft er t he power out
fe016 [ z] : So t hen t here would be no t em p files .
m e013 [ z] : Yeah .
m e011 [ z] : Uh , no , it doesn’t [ disfm arker] it doesn’t clear t hose
necessarily ,
fe016 [ z] : OK . [ com m ent ] Hm m .
fe016 [ z] : Oh wait [ disfm arker] It [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ z] : it doesn’t clear t hem ,
fe016 [ z] : OK .
m e011 [ z] : so .
m e013 [ z] : Hm m , no connect ion .
m e011 [ z] : It ’s [ disfm arker] i t hey ’re called t em p files ,
m e011 [ z] : but t hey ’re not act ually in t he t em p direct ory t hey ’re in
t he scrat ch ,
m e011 [ z] : so .
m e011 [ z] : They ’re not backed up , but t hey ’re not erased eit her on
power failure .
fe016 [ z] : But t hat ’s usually t he m eet ing t hat I recorded , and it neve
it doesn’t crash on m e .
m e011 [ z] : Oh well .
m e018 [ z] : Well t his wasn’t [ disfm arker] Act ually , t his wasn’t a before

m e013 [ fh|s^ ba] : Uh , So . That ’s good .
m e011 [ fg|s^ cs^ t ] : But , uh , yeah m aybe an agenda , or at least

m e013 [ s^ cs] : Well we can st art gat hering t hose [ disfm arker] t hose
ideas ,
m e013 [ s^ co] : but t hen we [ disfm arker] we should firm it up by next
[ disfm arker] nex t Thursday ’s m eet ing .
fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : Will we have t im e t o , um , t o prepare som et hing t hat
we [ disfm arker] in t he form at we were planning for t he IBM t ranscribers
by t hen ,
fe008 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Oh y eah .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Absolut ely .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : So have you heard back from Brian about t hat ,

m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yes ,
m e018 [ h] : um ,

m e018 [ s^ fa] : he ’s [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I ’m sorry , I should
have forwarded t hat along .
m e018 [ fh|s] : Uh , [ v ocalsound] oh I [ disfm arker] I t hink I m ent ioned at
t he last m eet ing ,
m e018 [ s] : he said t hat , um , he t alked t o t hem
m e018 [ s] : and it was fine [ disfm arker] wit h t he beeps
m e018 [ s] : t hey would be [ disfm arker] That ’s easy for t hem t o do .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Great .
m e011 [ b] : OK .
m e011 [ fh|s] : So , uh , oh , t hough Thi − Thilo isn’t here ,
m e011 [ fh] : um , but , uh ,
m e011 [ s.x ] : I [ disfm arker] I have t he program t o insert t he beeps .
m e011 [ s] : What I don’t have is som et hing t o parse t he out put of t he
channelized t ranscript s t o find out where t o put t he beeps ,
m e011 [ s] : but t hat should be really easy t o do .
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : So do we have a m eet ing t hat t hat ’s been done wit h ,
m e011 [ s^ e^ rt ] : t hat we ’ve t ight ened it up t o t he point where we can
act ually give it t o IBM and have t hem t ry it out ?
fe008 [ s.%−] : He ’s [ disfm arker] he ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ na] : He generat ed , um , a channel − wise presegm ent ed
v ersion of a m eet ing ,
fe008 [ s] : but it was Robust ness rat her t han EDU so I guess depends
on whet her we ’re willing t o use Robust ness ?
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : Well for t his experim ent I t hink we can use pre pret t y m uch
anyt hing .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s.%−] : This experim ent of just [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ng] : Well we had [ disfm arker] we had t alked about doing
m ay be EDU as a good choice , t hough .
m e011 [ s] : Well , [ vocalsound] what ever we have .
m e018 [ s] : Well we ’ve t alked about t hat as being t he next ones we
want ed t o t ranscribe .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e018 [ s.%−] : But for t he purpose of sending him a sam ple one t o
[ disfm arker] f
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ am ] : Yeah , m aybe it doesn’t m at t er .
fe008 [ fg] : Great .
m e018 [ s.%−] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t t hink it m at t e
fe008 [ s^ cc] : I ’ll [ disfm arker] I ’ll [ disfm arker] I ’ll , um , get
[ disfm arker] m ake t hat available .
m e011 [ s^ bk|qy^ rt ] : OK , and has it been correct ed ?
fe008 [ h|s^ co] : Oh , well , wait .
fe008 [ h] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Hand − checked ?

m e011 [ s^ df] : Cuz t hat was one of t he [ vocalsound] processes we
were t alking about as well .
m e018 [ fh|s^ co] : Right , so we need t o run Thilo ’s t hing on it ,
fe008 [ s^ bk] : That ’s right .
m e018 [ s] : and t hen we go in and adjust t he boundaries .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah t hat ’s right .
fe008 [ s] : Yeah , we haven’t done t hat .
m e011 [ s^ e] : And t im e how long it t akes .
fe008 [ s^ cc] : I [ disfm arker] I could set som eone on t hat t om orrow .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s] : And we probably don’t have t o do necessarily a whole
m eet ing for t hat if we just wanna send t hem a sam ple t o t ry .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I t hink t hey ’re com ing [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ qw] : What would be a good num ber of m inut es ?
m e018 [ s^ no] : I don’t know ,
m e018 [ s^ cs.%−−] : m aybe we can figure out how long it ’ll t ake @ @ t o
[ disfm arker] t o do .
m e011 [ fg] : Um ,
m e011 [ s^ no] : I don’t know ,
m e011 [ s^ cs] : it seem s t o m e w we probably should go ahead and do
a whole m eet ing
m e011 [ s^ df] : because we ’ll have t o t ranscribe t he whole m eet ing
anyway som et im e .
m e013 [ s^ arp] : Yes
m e013 [ s.%−−] : ex cept t hat if t hey had [ disfm arker] if t here was a
choice bet ween hav ing fift een m inut es t hat was fully t he way you
want ed it , and hav ing a whole m eet ing t hat didn’t get at what you
want ed for t hem [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : It ’s just dependent of how m uch [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Like I [ disfm arker] I m ean I guess if we have t o do it again
anyway ,
m e011 [ fh] : but , uh
m e013 [ s^ am ] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : I guess , t he only t hing I ’m not sure about is , um ,
m e018 [ qw] : how quickly can t he t ranscribers scan over and fix t he
boundaries ,
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : I m ean , is it pret t y easy ?
m e011 [ s.%−−] : I t hink it ’s gonna be one or t wo t im es real t im e at
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ fe|s^ bsc] : Wow , excuse m e , t wo or m ore t im es real t im e ,
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e011 [ s^ df] : Cuz t hey have t o at least list en t o it .

m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Can we pipeline it so t hat say t here ’s , uh , t he
t ranscriber get s done wit h a quart er of t he m eet ing and t hen we
[ disfm arker] you run it t hrough t his ot her [ disfm arker] ot her st uff ?
m e011 [ s^ ng] : Well t he ot her st uff is I B
m e013 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e011 [ s] : I ’m just t hinking t hat from a dat a [ disfm arker] keeping −
t rack − of − t he − dat a point of view , it m ay be best t o send t hem whole
m eet ings at a t im e and not t ry t o send t hem bit s and pieces .
m e013 [ fg] : OK , so .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Oh , t hat ’s right .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So t he first t hing is t he aut om at ic t hing ,
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ e] : and t hen it ’s [ disfm arker] t hen it ’s [ disfm arker] t hen it
’s t he t ranscribers t ight ening st uff up ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : and t hen it ’s IBM .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m , m m − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : OK , so you m ight as well ha run t he aut om at ic t hing
ov er t he ent ire m eet ing ,
m e013 [ s] : and t hen [ disfm arker] and t hen , uh , you would give IBM
what ev er was fix ed .
fe008 [ s^ e] : And have t hem fix it over t he ent ire m eet ing t oo ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ aap] : Well , yeah , but st art from t he beginning and go t o
t he end ,
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ s] : So if t hey were only half way t hrough t hen t hat ’s what you
’d giv e IBM .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e018 [ qw^ bu^ rt ] : As of what point ?
m e018 [ %−−] : I m ean .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : The [ disfm arker] I guess t he quest ion on m y m ind is
do we wait for t he t ranscribers t o adjust t he m arks for t he whole
m eet ing before we give anyt hing t o IBM ,
m e018 [ qrr] : or do we go ahead and send t hem a sam ple ?
m e013 [ qw.%−] : Why wouldn’t we s @ @ w
m e018 [ %−] : Let t heir [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : i if t hey were going sequent ially t hrough it , why
wouldn’t we giv e t hem [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy] : I m ean i are we t rying t o get som et hing done by t he t im e
Brian com es ?
m e018 [ s^ no] : Well I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I m ean , I don’t know .
m e011 [ s] : That was t he quest ion . Though .

m e013 [ s] : So if we [ disfm arker] if we were , t hen it seem s like giving
t hem som et hing , what ever t hey had got t en up t o , would be bet t er
t han not hing .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Uh . That [ disfm arker] I agree .
m e018 [ s^ aa^ r] : I agree .
m e011 [ fg|s^ no.%−] : Well , I don’t t hink [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : I m ean , h t hey [ disfm arker] t hey t ypically work
for what , four hours , som et hing like t hat ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Hm m , I gue hm m .
m e011 [ s] : I t hink t he t hey should be able t o get t hrough a whole
m eet ing in one sit t ing .
m e011 [ s] : I would t hink ,
m e011 [ s] : unless it ’s a lot harder t han we t hink it is ,
m e011 [ s] : which it could be , cert ainly .
fe008 [ s.%−] : If it ’s got like for speakers t hen I guess [ disfm arker] I
m ean if [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ e] : Or seven or eight .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : We ’re just doing t he individual channels ,
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe008 [ s^ m ^ rt ] : Individual channels .
fe008 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : So it ’s gonna be , depending on t he num ber of people
in t he m eet ing ,
m e018 [ fh] : um ,
fe008 [ s] : I guess t here is t his issue of , you know , if [ disfm arker] if
t he segm ent er t hought t here was no speech on [ disfm arker] on a
part icular st ret ch , on a part icular channel ,
m e011 [ fg] : Well [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : and t here really was , t hen , if it didn’t show up in a m ixed
signal t o v erify , t hen it m ight be overlooked ,
fe008 [ fh|qr] : so , I m ean , t he quest ion is " should [ disfm arker] should
a t ranscriber list en t o t he ent ire t hing or can it g can it be based on
t he m ixed signal ? "
fe008 [ s] : And I t h eh so far as I ’m concerned it ’s fine t o base it on
t he m ixed signal at t his point ,
fe008 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : That ’s what it seem s t o m e t oo , in t hat if t hey need t o ,
just like in t he ot her cases , t hey can list en t o t he individual , if t hey
need t o .
fe008 [ s^ e] : And t hat cut s down t he t im e .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : But t hey don’t have t o for m ost of it .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Yeah , t hat ’s good .
fe008 [ fh] : So . Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : I don’t see how t hat will work , t hough .

fe008 [ b] : Good , good , good .
fe008 [ qw^ rt ] : What [ disfm arker] what aspect ?
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So you ’re t alking about t ight ening up t im e boundaries
?
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So , t hey have t he norm al channelt rans int erface where
t hey have each individual speaker has t heir own line ,
m e013 [ qw.%−] : So how do you [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : but y ou ’re list ening t o t he m ixed signal and you ’re
t ight ening t he boundaries ,
m e011 [ s^ bsc] : correct ing t he boundaries .
m e011 [ s] : You shouldn’t have t o t ight en t hem t oo m uch because
Thilo ’s program does t hat .
fe008 [ s.x ] : Should be pret t y good ,
fe008 [ b] : yeah .
fe016 [ s^ arp] : Ex cept for [ vocalsound] it doesn’t do well on short
t hings , rem em ber .
m e011 [ fg|s.%−] : Right , so [ disfm arker] so you ’ll have t o I [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : It will m iss t hem .
fe016 [ s^ r] : It will m iss m ost of t he really short t hings .
m e011 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe016 [ s] : Like t hat .
fe008 [ s.%−] : But t hose would be [ disfm arker] t hose would be
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ m ] : Uh − huh .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh !
fe016 [ s.%−−] : It will [ disfm arker] it will m iss [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ co.%−−] : Yeah , you have t o say " uh − huh " m ore slowly t o
[ disfm arker] t o get c
m e011 [ s^ fa] : Sorry .
m e011 [ s^ cc^ j] : I ’ll work on t hat .
fe016 [ s] : No , I ’m s I ’m act ually serious .
fe016 [ s.%−] : So it will m iss st uff like t hat which [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg|s] : Well , so [ disfm arker] so t hat ’s som et hing t hat t he
t ranscribers will hav e t o [ disfm arker] have t o do .
m e018 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ fg|s] : Yeah , but presum ably , m ost of t hose t hey should be
able t o hear from t he m ixed signal unless t hey ’re em bedded in t he
heavil heav y overlap sect ion
fe008 [ s] : when [ disfm arker] in which case t hey ’d be list ening t o t he
channels anyway .
fe016 [ b] : Right ,
m e018 [ s] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s what I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m
concerned about t he part .
fe016 [ s] : and t hat ’s what I ’m not sure about .

fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
fe008 [ s^ aa] : I am t oo .
fe008 [ s] : And I t hink it ’s an em pirical quest ion .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : Can’t we [ disfm arker] uh couldn’t we just have , um ,
m e018 [ s] : I don’t know , m ay be t his just doesn’t fit wit h t he soft ware ,
m e018 [ s.%−] : but I guess if I didn’t know anyt hing about Transcriber
and I was gonna m ake som et hing t o let t hem adjust boundaries , I
would just show t hem one channel at a t im e , wit h t he m arks , and let
t hem adju
fe008 [ s.%−] : Oh t hey can [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ nd.%−−] : Well , but t hen t hey have t o do [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ nd.x ] : but t hen t hey [ disfm arker] for t his m eet ing t hey
would have t o do seven t im es real t im e , and it would probably be m ore
t han t hat .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , t hat ’s it .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e011 [ s^ df] : Because t hey ’d have t o at least list en t o each channel
all t he way t hrough .
m e018 [ s] : But i but it ’s very quick ,
fe008 [ %−] : And if [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e018 [ s] : I m ean , you scan [ disfm arker] I m ean , if you have a
display of t he wav eform .
m e011 [ s^ bu] : Oh , you ’re t alking about visually .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ nd.%−] : I just don’t t hink [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ fg|s^ arp] : w Well , t he ot her problem is t he breat hs
fe008 [ s^ df] : cuz y ou also see t he breat hs on t he waveform .
fe008 [ s] : I ’v e [ disfm arker] I ’ve looked at t he int uh , s I ’ve t ried t o do
t hat wit h a single channel ,
fe008 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and y ou do see all sort s of ot her st uff
besides just t he voice .
m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , and I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat t hey ’re going m uch
m ore on acoust ics t han t hey are on visuals .
fe008 [ s^ am ] : Well t hat [ disfm arker] t hat I ’m not sure .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
fe008 [ qy^ bu^ rt ] : What you [ disfm arker] t he digit al [ disfm arker] what
t he digit al t ask t hat you had your int erface ?
fe008 [ fh|s] : Um , I know for a fact t hat one of t hose [ disfm arker] sh
she could really well [ disfm arker] she could judge what t h what t he
num ber was based on t he [ disfm arker] on t he waveform .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , t hat ’s act ually t rue .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , you ’re right .

m e011 [ s^ aa] : You ’re absolut ely right .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , I found t he sam e t hing t hat when I was scanning
t hrough t he wave form [ vocalsound] I could see when som eone
st art ed t o read digit s just by t he shapes .
fe008 [ s] : Yeah , she could t ell which one was seven .
m e011 [ s^ am ] : Um , m aybe .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−] : So I don’t [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m now ent irely confused about what
t hey do .
m e013 [ fh|qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So , t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re looking at a
m ix ed signal ,
m e013 [ qrr^ rt .%−−] : or t hey ’re looking [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw] : what [ disfm arker] what are t hey looking at visually ?
fe008 [ fg|s] : Well , t hey have a choice .
fe008 [ s] : They could choose any signal t o look at .
fe008 [ s] : I ’v e t ried lookin but usually t hey look at t he m ixed .
fe008 [ s] : But I ’ve [ disfm arker] I ’ve t ried looking at t he single signal
and [ disfm arker] and in order t o judge when it [ disfm arker] when it was
speech and when it wasn’t ,
m e011 [ b] : Oh .
fe008 [ s] : but t he problem is t hen you have breat hs which
[ disfm arker] which show up on t he signal .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : But t he procedure t hat you ’re im agining , I m ean ,
people v ary from t his , is t hat t hey have t he m ixed signal wave form in
front of t hem ,
fe008 [ b] : Yes .
m n017 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
fe008 [ b] : Yes .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and t hey have m ult iple ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh , well , let ’s see , t here isn’t [ disfm arker] we don’t
have t ranscript ion yet .
m e013 [ fh|s^ bu] : So [ disfm arker] but t here ’s m arkers of som e sort
t hat hav e been happening aut om at ically ,
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : and t hose show up on t he m ixed signal ?
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : There ’s a @ @ clicks ?
m e011 [ %−] : N t he t
fe008 [ s^ fe] : Oh ,
fe008 [ s] : t hey show up on t he separat e ribbons .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : So you have a separat e ribbon for each channel ,
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m ] : There ’re separat e ribbons .

fe008 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and i i it ’ll be [ disfm arker] because it ’s
being segm ent ed as channel at a t im e wit h his [ disfm arker] wit h Thilo
’s new procedure ,
fe008 [ s] : t hen you don’t have t he correspondence of t he t im es
across t he bins [ disfm arker] uh across t he ribbons
fe008 [ s.%−] : uh you could have [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : And is t here a line m oving across t he waveform as it
goes ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ bu] : OK , so The way you ’re im aging is t hey kind of
play it ,
m e013 [ s^ bu] : and t hey see oh t his happened , t hen t his happened ,
t hen [ disfm arker] and if it ’s about right , t hey just sort of let it slide ,
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : and if it [ disfm arker] if it [ disfm arker] t here ’s a
quest ion on som et hing , t hey st op and m aybe look at t he individual
wav e form .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ bk|s^ nd] : Oh , well not [ disfm arker] not " look " .
m e011 [ s^ nd] : Well , t hey wouldn’t look at it [ pause] at t his point .
m e011 [ s^ e] : They would just list en .
m e013 [ s] : They [ disfm arker] t hey m ight look at it ,
m e011 [ s] : Well , t he problem is t hat t he [ disfm arker] t he int erface
doesn’t really allow you t o swit ch visuals .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe008 [ s^ e] : Not v ery quickly .
m e011 [ s] : The problem is t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t he Tcl −
TK int erface wit h t he visuals , it ’s v ery slow t o load waveform s .
fe008 [ s] : You can but it t akes t im e .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : That ’s it .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m e011 [ s^ df] : And so when I t ried [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
was t he first t hing I t ried when I first st art ed it ,
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh , oh .
fe008 [ s] : Visually .
m e011 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe008 [ s] : You can [ disfm arker] you can swit ch quickly bet ween t he
audio ,
fe008 [ s] : but you just can’t get t he v isual display t o show quickly .
fe008 [ s^ co.%−−] : So you have t o [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : It t akes , I don’t know , t hree , four m inut es t o
[ disfm arker]

fe008 [ fh|s.%−] : Well , I m ean , it t akes [ disfm arker] it t akes long
enough [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fg|s^ bs] : Yeah , it ’s very slow t o do t hat .
fe008 [ s^ r.%−−] : It t akes long enough cuz it has t o reload t he
fe008 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know exact ly what it ’s doing
frankly
fe008 [ s] : cuz [ disfm arker] but it t it t akes long enough t hat it ’s just
not a pract ical alt ernat ive .
fe016 [ %−] : That w
m e011 [ s] : Well it [ disfm arker] it does som e sort of shape pre −
com put at ion so t hat it can t hen scroll it quickly ,
m e001 [ s^ cs] : But you can cancel t hat .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ ng] : But t hen you can’t change t he resolut ion or scroll
quickly .
m e001 [ qy^ bh^ d] : Oh , really ?
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e001 [ b] : Huh !
fe008 [ s^ cs] : Now y ou could set up m ult iple windows , each one wit h
a different signal showing , and t hen look bet ween t he windows .
fe008 [ s] : Maybe t hat ’s t he solut ion .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : I m ean , we [ disfm arker] we could do different
int erfaces ,
m e001 [ qw^ cs] : What if you preload t hem all ?
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e011 [ s^ cs] : I m ean , so [ disfm arker] so we could use like X Waves
inst ead of Transcriber ,
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ e] : and it loads fast er , cert ainly .
m e001 [ qr^ cs] : What if you were t o preload all t he channels or
[ disfm arker] or init ially [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ %−] : like doesn’t [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Well t hat ’s what I t ried originally .
m e011 [ s] : So I [ disfm arker] I act ually before , uh , Dave Gelbart did
t his , I did an int erface which showed each waveform and ea a ribbon
for each waveform ,
m e001 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : but t he problem wit h it is ev en wit h just t hree waveform s it
was just painfully slow t o scroll .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e011 [ s^ fe] : So you just scroll a screen and it would , you know go "
kur − chunk ! "
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : And so it just was not doable wit h t he current int erface .

fe008 [ s] : You know , I am t hinking if we have a m eet ing wit h only four
speakers
fe008 [ s^ cs] : and , you know , you could fire up a Transcriber
int erface for , y y ou know , in different windows , m ult iple ones , one for
each channel .
fe008 [ s^ df] : And it ’s sort of a [ disfm arker] a hack but I m ean it would
be one way of seeing t he visual form .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : I t hink t hat if we decide t hat we need [ disfm arker] t hat
t hey need t o see t he visuals , we need t o change t he int erface so t hat
t hey can do t hat .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ na] : That ’s act ually what I t hought of , loading t he chopped
up wav eform s , I m ean , you know , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat would m ake
it fast er [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ %−] : An
m e013 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ b] : Hm m .
m e011 [ %−] : But isn’t [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ m ^ t 1] : The chopped up waveform s .
m e018 [ s] : The problem is if [ disfm arker] if anyt hing ’s cut off , you
can’t ex pand it from t he chopped up [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ %−] : Isn’t t hat [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : Right , but if y ou
m e011 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : And wouldn’t t hat be t he sam e [ com m ent ] as t he
m ix ed signal ?
fe016 [ s.%−] : a at som e point [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ ar|s.%−] : No , I m ean t he individual channels t hat were
chopped up t hat [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ cs] : it ’d be nice t o be able t o go back and fort h bet ween
t hose short segm ent s .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ df] : Cuz you don’t really nee like nine t ent hs of t he t im e you
’re t hrowing m ost of t hem out ,
fe016 [ s] : but what you need are t ho t hat part icular channel , or t hat
part icular locat ion ,
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ %−−] : and ,
fe016 [ fh|s^ cs] : um , m ight be nice , cuz we save t hose out already ,
[ com m ent ] um , t o be able t o do t hat .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : But it won’t work for IBM of course ,
fe016 [ s^ e^ rt ] : it only works here cuz t hey ’re not saving out t he
indiv idual channels .

fe008 [ s] : Well , I [ disfm arker] I do t hink t hat t his [ disfm arker] t his will
be a doable procedure ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : and hav e t hem st art ing wit h m ixed
m e013 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ fh|s] : and , um , t hen when t hey get int o overlaps , just have
t hem syst em at ically check all t he channels t o be sure t hat t here isn’t
som et hing hidden from [ disfm arker] from audio view .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fh|s.%−−] : Yeah , hopefully , I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : The m ixed signal , t he overlaps are pret t y audible because
it is volum e equalized .
m e011 [ s] : So I t hink t hey should be able t o hear .
m e011 [ s] : The only problem is [ disfm arker] is , you know , count ing
how m any and if t hey ’re really correct or not .
m e011 [ fh|s^ no] : So , I don’t know .
fe016 [ s] : I don’t know t hat you can locat e t hem very well from t he
m ix ed signal ,
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ arp^ df] : Right but [ disfm arker] but once [ disfm arker]
once y ou know t hat t hey happen , y ou can at least list en t o t he close
t alking ,
fe016 [ s^ df] : but y ou would know t hat t hey were t here , and t hen you
would swit ch .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : And t hen you would swit ch int o t he ot her [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fh] : so .
m e013 [ s^ bs] : But right now , t o do t his lim it at ion , t he swit ching is
going t o be swit ching of t he audio ? Is what she ’s saying .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa^ r] : Right ,
m e011 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker] so
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : did Dave [ disfm arker] Did Dave do t hat change where
y ou can act ually just click rat her t han hav ing t o go up t o t he m enu t o
list en t o t he individual channels ?
m e013 [ s^ bu] : so t hey ’re using t heir ears t o do t hese m arkings
anyway .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yes .
fe008 [ %−] : Click [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ h] : Um ,
m e011 [ s] : I had suggest ed it before .
m e011 [ s] : I just don’t know whet her he did it or not .

fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : I ’m not sure what [ disfm arker] click what [ disfm arker]
click on t he ribbon ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , you can get t hat [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ fe] : oh , oh ,
fe008 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : get [ disfm arker] you can get t he , uh
[ disfm arker] you can get it t o swit ch audio ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ h|s^ nd] : Uh , not last I t ried ,
fe008 [ fh|s] : but , um , m aybe he ’s changed it again .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : We should get him t o do t hat
m e011 [ s^ df] : because , uh , I t hink t hat would be m uch , m uch fast er
t han going t o t he m enu .
fe008 [ s^ ar] : I disagree .
fe008 [ s^ df] : There ’s a reason I disagree , and t hat is t hat , uh , you
[ disfm arker] it ’s v ery good t o have a dissociat ion bet ween t he visual
and t he audio .
fe008 [ s^ e] : There ’re t im es when I wanna hear t he m ixed signal ,
fe008 [ s] : bu but I want t o t ranscribe on t he single channel .
fe008 [ fh|s.%−] : So right now [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ cs] : Then m aybe just but t ons down at t he bot t om next t o it
.
fe008 [ s^ am |s^ no.%−] : Maybe , I just don’t [ disfm arker] I don’t see
t hat it ’s a [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Just som et hing so t hat it ’s not in t he m enu opt ion so t hat
y ou can do it m uch fast er .
fe008 [ h|s] : Well , I m ean , t hat ’s t he i I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat m ight
be a personal st y le t hing .
fe008 [ s] : I find it really convenient t he way [ disfm arker] t he way it ’s
set up right now .
m e011 [ fg|s:qy] : Well it just seem s t o m e t hat if you wanna quickly
[ disfm arker] " well was t hat Jane , no , was t hat Chuck , no , was t hat
Morgan " , right now , you have t o go up t o t he m enu ,
m e011 [ s] : and each t im e , go up t o t he m enu , select it , list en t o
t hat channel t hen click below ,
m e011 [ s] : and t hen go back t o t he m enu , select t he next one , and
t hen click below .
fe008 [ b] : That ’s fine .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , it ’s t rue .
m e011 [ s] : So y ou can definit ely st ream line t hat wit h t he i wit h t he

fe008 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , it could be fast er ,
fe008 [ s^ j.%−−] : but , you know , I m ean , t h in t he ideal world
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qw] : What ?
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .

fe008 [ s^ ba] : No I [ disfm arker] I agree t hat ’d be nice .
m e011 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ fg|qy ^ d^ rt ^ t c] : So , um , Done wit h t hat ?
m e013 [ %−−] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ s^ df] : Does any [ disfm arker] I forget ,
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : does anybody , uh , working on any [ disfm arker] any
Eurospeech subm ission relat ed t o t his ?
m e011 [ s^ na] : I would like t o t ry t o do som et hing on digit s
m e011 [ s] : but I just don’t know if we have t im e .

m e011 [ s] : we ’ll just have t o see .
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : So act ually I wanna get t oget her wit h bot h Andreas and

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah t here was t hat [ disfm arker] we
m e013 [ s^ bk] : t hat ’s right ,
m e013 [ s] : we had t hat one conversat ion about , uh , what
[ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker] what did it m ean for , uh , one of t hose

m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right ,
m e013 [ qy.%−] : was it a [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : and I haven’t had s chance t o sit down and list en .
m n017 [ s] : Oh , I hav en’t [ disfm arker] I haven’t list ened t o t hem eit her
,
m e011 [ s^ cc] : I was going t o do t hat t his aft ernoon .
m n017 [ s] : but t here m ust be som et hing wrong ,
m n017 [ fh] : I m ean ,
m n017 [ %−] : unless our [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg|s] : Well , Morgan and I were [ disfm arker] were having a

m e011 [ s] : Whereas I t hink it it ’s probably som et hing pat hologic
m e011 [ s] : and act ually St ephane ’s result s , I t hink confirm t hat .
m e011 [ s] : He s he did t he Aurora syst em
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : also got very lousy av erage error , like fift een or
[ disfm arker] or , uh , fift een t o t went y percent average ?
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : But t hen he ran it just on t he lapel , and got about five

m e011 [ s] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat m eans t o m e t hat som ewhere in
t he ot her recordings t here are som e pat hological cases .
m e011 [ fh|s^ am ] : But , you know , we [ disfm arker] t h t hat m ay not be

m e011 [ s^ am ] : It m ay be just som e of t he segm ent s t hey ’re just
doing a lousy job on .
m e011 [ s^ cc] : So I ’ll [ disfm arker] I ’ll list en t o it and find out since you

m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : So I can act ually list en t o it .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Did y ou run t he [ disfm arker] Andreas [ disfm arker] t he

m n017 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Oh , I t hought he had sent t hat around t o everyone ,
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : did you just sent t hat t o m e ?
m n017 [ s^ ar] : No , I d I didn’t .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n017 [ s^ df] : Since I considered t hose prelim inary , I didn’t .

m e018 [ %−] : I it wasn’t [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : It was bim odal .
m n017 [ %−−] : So if you [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ ar|s] : Yeah , it ’s act ually , um , it [ disfm arker] uh
[ disfm arker] it was t rim odal , act ually [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ bh|s^ bk] : Oh , was it t rim odal , OK .
m n017 [ s^ aa^ r] : t rim odal ,
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n017 [ fh] : so
m e013 [ s] : There ’s zero , a lit t le bit , and a lot .
m n017 [ s] : t here were [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t t here was
[ disfm arker] t here was one h one bum p at ze around zero , which were
t he nat iv e speakers ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ e] : t he non − pat hological nat ive speakers .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : Zero percent error ?
m e013 [ b] : Y y eah .
m n017 [ s] : Then t here was anot her bum p at , um , [ vocalsound]
[ v ocalsound] oh , like fift een or som et hing .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu] : Oh was it fift een ?
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : This is error you ’re t alking about ?
m n017 [ %−] : whe
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n017 [ s] : Those were t he non − nat ives .
m n017 [ s] : And t hen t here was anot her dist inct bum p at , like , a

fe008 [ s^ fe] : Oh , wow !
m n017 [ s] : I can’t im agine t hat [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Oh , OK .
m e001 [ qw^ rt ] : What is pat ho what do you m ean by pat hological ?
m e001 [ s^ fa.%−] : I ’m sorry , I don’t [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.%−] : Just [ disfm arker] just som et hing really wrong wit h
[ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n017 [ s^ 2^ e] : In t he recording
m e011 [ s] : A bug is what I m ean ,
m e011 [ s.%−] : so t hat it ’s like [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n017 [ s] : And t here was t his one m eet ing , I forget which one it was
, where like , uh , six out of t he eight channels were all , like
[ disfm arker] had a hundred percent error .
m e011 [ s] : Which probably m eans like t here was a [ disfm arker] t h t he
recording int erface crashed ,
m e001 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : or t here was a short [ disfm arker] you know , som eone was
jiggling wit h a cord
m n017 [ fg] : But [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : or , uh , I ext ract ed it incorrect ly ,
m n017 [ fg] : But [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : it was labeled [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : it was t ranscribed incorrect ly ,
m e011 [ s] : som et hing really bad happened ,
m e001 [ b] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : and I just haven’t list ened t o it yet t o find out what it was .
m n017 [ fg|s] : So , if I excluded t he pat hological ones , [ vocalsound] by
definit ion , t hose t hat had like over ninet y − five percent error rat e ,
[ v ocalsound] and t he non − nat ives , t hen t he average error rat e was
like one point four or som et hing ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : What we ’re calling .
fe008 [ s^ fe] : Oh .
m e001 [ b] : Hm m !
m n017 [ s] : which [ disfm arker] which seem ed reasonable given t hat ,
y ou know , t he m odels weren’t t uned for [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] for
it .
fe008 [ b] : Oh .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : And t he gram m ar wasn’t t uned eit her .
m n017 [ s.%−] : It was just a @ @ .
m e018 [ qrr^ bu^ d.%−−] : And it didn’t m at t er whet her it was t he lapel or
whet her it was t he [ disfm arker]

m n017 [ s^ ng] : I hav en’t split it up t hat way ,
m n017 [ %−] : but it would be [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : But t here ’s no overlap during t he digit readings , so it
shouldn’t really m at t er .
m e001 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s.%−] : So it should [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No , but t here ’s a lit t le difference ,
m e011 [ s] : There ’s a lot .
m e013 [ s] : and we haven’t looked at it for digit s ,
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ fh] : And so ,
m e018 [ s] : Yeah , so I was curious about t hat .
m e013 [ s] : cuz [ disfm arker] because what he was [ disfm arker] what I
was say ing when I looked at t hose t hings is it [ disfm arker] it
[ disfm arker] I was alm ost gonna call it quadrim odal because
[ v ocalsound] [ disfm arker] because t here was a whole lot of cases
where it was zero percent .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : They just plain got it all right .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen t here [ disfm arker] and t hen t here was anot her
bunch t hat were couple percent or som et hing .
m n017 [ s] : But if you p if you act ually hist ogram m ed it , and
[ disfm arker] it was a nice [ disfm arker] uh , you know , it [ disfm arker] it
was [ disfm arker] zero was t he m ost of t hem ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : A norm al .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : but t hen t here were [ disfm arker] t he ot hers were sort of
decay ing from t here .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ b] : yeah .
m n017 [ s] : And t hen t here was t he bum p for t he non − nat ives and
t hen t he pat hological ones ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n017 [ fh] : so .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah , cuz som e of our non − nat ives are pret t y non −
nat iv e .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ b^ rt ] : Yeah .

fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : You [ disfm arker] did y ou have , uh , som et hing in t he
report about , uh , [ disfm arker] about , uh , for f uh , forced alignm ent
?
fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : Have you [ disfm arker] have you st art ed on t hat ?
m n017 [ h|s] : Oh , well , yeah , so I ’ve been st ruggling wit h t he forced
alignm ent s .
m n017 [ fh|s] : Um . [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] So t he schem e t hat I
drew on t he board last t im e where we t ried t o , um [ vocalsound] allow
reject m odels for t he s speech from ot her speakers ,
m n017 [ fh|s] : um , [ v ocalsound] [ vocalsound] m ost of t he t im e it
doesn’t work very well .
m n017 [ fh|s.%−−] : So , [ vocalsound] um , [ vocalsound] and t he
[ disfm arker] I haven’t done [ disfm arker] I m ean , t he only way t o check
t his right now was for m e t o act ually [ vocalsound] load t hese int o X
Wav es and , you know , plus t he alignm ent s , and s play t hem and see
where t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
m n017 [ s] : And it looks [ disfm arker] And so I looked at all of t he
ut t erances from you , Chuck , in t hat one conversat ion ,
m n017 [ s] : I don’t know which [ disfm arker] You probably know which
one I m ean , it ’s where you were on t he lapel [ vocalsound] and
Morgan was sit t ing next t o you
m n017 [ s] : and we can hear everyt hing Morgan says .
fe008 [ b] : Hm m .
m n017 [ fh|s] : But [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and som e of what you
[ disfm arker] I m ean , you also appear quit e a bit in t hat cross − t alk .
m n017 [ fh|s] : So , [ v ocalsound] I act ually went t hrough all of t hose ,
m n017 [ s] : t here were I t hink fift y − five segm ent s , [ vocalsound] um ,
in [ disfm arker] in X Waves , and [ disfm arker] and sort of did a crude
check ,
m n017 [ fh|s] : and [ vocalsound] m ore oft en t han not , it [ disfm arker] it
get s it wrong .
m n017 [ s] : So t here ’s eit her t he beginning , m ost ly t he beginning
word , [ v ocalsound] where t h you , um , you know , Chuck t alks
som ewhere int o t he segm ent ,
m n017 [ s:s] : but t he first , um , word of what he says , oft en " I "
m n017 [ s:s] : but it ’s very reduced " I , "
m n017 [ s] : t hat ’s just aligned [ vocalsound] t o t he beginning of
som eone else ’s speech , uh in t hat segm ent ,
m n017 [ s:s] : which is cross − t alk .
m n017 [ fh|s] : So , [ vocalsound] um , [ v ocalsound] I ’m st ill t inkering
wit h it ,
m n017 [ s] : but it m ight well be t hat we can’t get clean alignm ent s out
of t his [ disfm arker] out of t hose , uh , [ vocalsound] channels ,
m n017 [ fh] : so .

m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Unless m aybe we do t his , uh , um ,
cancellat ion business .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : Right , but t hat ’s [ disfm arker] I m ean , t hat was our
plan ,
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , right .
fe016 [ s] : but it ’s clear from Dan t hat t his is not som et hing you can
do in a short am ount of t im e .
m e013 [ s|s^ bk] : Oh , t he short am ount of t im e t hing , right .
fe016 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : so we [ disfm arker] you know , we had spent a lot of t im e ,
um , writ ing up t he HLT paper
fe016 [ s] : and we want ed t o use t hat , uh , kind of analysis ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : but t he HLT paper has , you know , it ’s a very crude
m easure of overlap .
fe016 [ s] : It ’s not really som et hing you could scient ifically say is
ov erlap ,
fe016 [ s] : it ’s just whet her or not t he , um , t he segm ent s t hat were
all synchronized , whet her t here was som e overlap som ewhere .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : c High correlat ion .
fe016 [ fh|s] : And , you know , t hat point ed out som e differences ,
fe016 [ s] : so he t hought well if we can do som et hing quick and dirt y
because Dan said t he cross − cancellat ion , it ’s not st raight − forward .
fe016 [ s] : If it were st raight − forward t hen we would t ry it ,
fe016 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : so , it ’s sort of good t o hear t hat it was not st raight −
forward , t hinking if we can get decent forced alignm ent s , t hen at
least we can do sort of a overall report of what happens wit h act ual
ov erlap in t im e ,
fe016 [ fh] : but , um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ ng] : I didn’t t hink t hat his m essage said it wasn’t st raight −
forward .
m e011 [ s.%−] : Well if we ’d just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg] : Well
m e011 [ b] : Um − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : I t hought he ’s just saying you have t o look over a
longer t im e window when you do it .
fe016 [ s^ ng] : and t he [ disfm arker] but t here are som e issues of t his
t im ing , um , in t he recordings
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fg] : Right .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : So you just have t o look over longer t im e when you ’re
t ry ing t o align t he t hings ,
m e018 [ s.%−] : you can’t [ disfm arker] you can’t just look [ disfm arker]

m e011 [ fg|qy ^ rt .x ] : Well . are you t alking about t he fact t hat t he
recording soft ware doesn’t do t im e − synchronous ?
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t hat what you ’re referring t o ?
m e013 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e011 [ s] : That seem s t o m e y ou can do t hat over t he ent ire file and
get a v ery accurat e [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ nd] : I don’t t hi I d I don’t t hink t hat was t he issue .
fe016 [ fg] : I [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fg|s^ rt ] : yeah , t hat was sort of a side issue .
m n017 [ s] : The issue was t hat you have [ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker]
y ou hav e have [ disfm arker] you first have t o have a pret t y good
speech det ect ion on t he individual channels .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : I didn’t t hink so eit her .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : And it ’s dynam ic , so I guess it was m ore dynam ic t han
som e sim ple m odels would be able t t o [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : so [ disfm arker] so t here are som e t hings available ,
fe016 [ s^ no] : and I don’t know t oo m uch about t his area
fe016 [ s] : where if people aren’t m oving around m uch t han you could
apply t hem ,
fe016 [ s] : and it should work pret t y well if you t ook care of t his
recording t im e difference .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s] : Right , which should be pret t y st raight forward .
fe016 [ s] : Which a at least is well defined ,
fe016 [ fh] : and
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ fh|s.%−−] : um , but t hen if you add t he dynam ic aspect of
adapt ing dist ances , t hen it wasn’t [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : I guess it just wasn’t som et hing t hat he could do quickly
[ pause] and not [ disfm arker] in t im e for us t o be able t o do som et hing
by t wo weeks from now ,
fe016 [ fh] : so .
fe016 [ s^ bsc] : Well less t han a week .
fe016 [ fh|s^ no] : So [ disfm arker] um , so I don’t know what we can do
if any t hing , t hat ’s sort of wort h , y ou know , a Eurospeech paper at
t his point .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Well , Andreas , how well did it work on t he non − lapel
st uff ?
m e011 [ s] : Yeah . That ’s what I was gonna say .
m n017 [ s^ no] : I hav en’t checked t hose yet .
m e011 [ %−] : C
m n017 [ s^ df] : It ’s very t edious t o check t hese .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m n017 [ fh|s] : Um , we would really need , ideally , a t ranscriber
[ v ocalsound] t o t im e m ark t he [ disfm arker] you know , t he be at least
t he beginning and s ends [ com m ent ] of cont iguous speech .

m n017 [ fh|s] : Um , [ v ocalsound] [ vocalsound] and , you know , t hen
wit h t he t im e m arks , you can do an aut om at ic com parison of your
[ disfm arker] of your forced alignm ent s .
m e018 [ s] : Because [ disfm arker] really t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] at least in t erm s of how we were gonna use t his in our
sy st em was t o get an ideal [ disfm arker] an idea , uh , for each channel
about t he st art and end boundaries .
m e011 [ s.%] : Oh , MNCM .
m e011 [ s] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : We don’t really care about like int erm ediat e word
boundaries ,
m n017 [ s^ aa] : No , t hat ’s how I ’v e been looking at it .
m e018 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ e] : I m ean , I don’t care t hat t he individual words are
aligned correct ly ,
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ fh|s] : but [ v ocalsound] you don’t wanna , uh , infer from t he
alignm ent t hat som eone spoke who didn’t .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Right , exact ly .
m n017 [ fh.%] : so , so [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s.%−−] : So t hat ’s why I was wondering if it [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ cs] : I m ean , m aybe if it doesn’t work for lapel st uff , we can
just not use t hat
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : I hav en’t [ disfm arker] I ha just haven’t had t he t im e t o ,
um , do t he sam e procedure on one of t he [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : so I would need a k I would need a channel t hat has
[ v ocalsound] a speaker whose [ disfm arker] who has a lot of overlap
but s y ou know , is a non − lapel m ike .
m n017 [ fh|s] : And , um , [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] where preferably ,
also t here ’s som eone sit t ing next t o t hem who t alks a lot .
m e011 [ b] : Hm m !
m n017 [ fh|%−] : So , I [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bs] : So a m eet ing wit h m e in it .
m n017 [ s^ cs.%−−] : m aybe som eone can help m e find a good
candidat e and t hen I would be willing t o
m e018 [ qh] : We c y ou know what ?
m e018 [ s^ cs] : Maybe t he best way t o find t hat would be t o look
t hrough t hese .
m n017 [ %−] : you know , hand
m e018 [ s^ df^ rt ] : Cuz you can see t he seat num bers ,
m e018 [ s] : and t hen you can see what t y pe of m ike t hey were using .

m e018 [ s] : And so we just look for , you know , som ebody sit t ing next
t o Adam at one of t he m eet ings [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : Act ually y we can t ell from t he dat a t hat we have ,
m n017 [ qy ^ 2^ d^ rt ] : From t he insert ions , m aybe ?
m n017 [ %−] : fr fr from t he [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fh|s] : um , y eah , t here ’s a way t o t ell .
fe016 [ s] : It m ight not be a single person who ’s always overlapping
t hat person but any num ber of people ,
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ fh|s] : and , um , if you align t he t wo hypot hesis files across t he
channels , you know , just word alignm ent , you ’d be able t o find t hat .
fe016 [ fh|s.%−−] : So [ disfm arker] so I guess t hat ’s sort of a last
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ cs] : t her t here ’re sort of a few t hings we could do .
fe016 [ s] : One is just do like non − lapels if we can get good enough
alignm ent s .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : Anot her one was t o t ry t o get [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : som ehow align Thilo ’s energy segm ent at ions wit h what we
have .
fe016 [ s] : But t hen you have t he problem of not knowing where t he
words are because t hese m eet ings were done before t hat
segm ent at ion .
fe016 [ s] : But m ay be t here ’s som et hing t hat could be done .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : What [ disfm arker] what is [ disfm arker] why do you
need t he , um , t he forced alignm ent for t he HLT [ disfm arker] I m ean
for t he Eurospeech paper ?
fe016 [ h|s] : Well , I guess I [ disfm arker] I want ed t o just do som et hing
not on recognit ion experim ent s
fe016 [ s^ df] : because t hat ’s ju way t oo early , but t o be able t o
report , you know , act ual num bers .
fe016 [ s] : Like if we [ disfm arker] if we had hand − t ranscribed pe good
alignm ent s or hand − checked alignm ent s , t hen we could do t his
paper .
fe016 [ s] : It ’s not t hat we need it t o be aut om at ic .
fe016 [ s.%−] : But wit hout knowing where t he real words are , in t im e
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu] : So it was t o get [ disfm arker] it was t o get m ore dat a
and bet t er [ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker] t o squeeze t he boundaries in .
fe016 [ s] : To [ disfm arker] t o know what an overlap really [ disfm arker]
if it ’s really an ov erlap , or if it ’s just a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a
segm ent correlat ed wit h an ov erlap ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Ah , OK .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : and I guess t hat ’s t he difference t o m e bet ween like a real
paper and a sort of , prom issory paper .
fe016 [ fh|s.%−−] : So , um , if we d

fe016 [ s.%−−] : it m ight be possible t o t ake Thilo ’s out put
fe016 [ s] : and like if you have , um , like right now t hese m eet ings are
all ,
m e011 [ s^ fe] : Ugh !
m e011 [ s^ t 1] : I forgot t he digit al cam era again .
fe016 [ fh] : um ,
m e011 [ s^ e^ t 1] : Ev ery m eet ing !
fe016 [ s] : you know , t hey ’re t im e − aligned ,
fe016 [ s] : so if t hese are t wo different channels and som ebody ’s
t alking here and som ebody else is t alking here , just t hat word ,
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : if Thilo can t ell us t hat t here ’re boundaries here , we
should be able t o figure t hat out
fe016 [ s^ df] : because t he only t hing t ranscribed in t his channel is
t his word .
fe016 [ fh|s.%−−] : But , um , you know , if t here are t hings [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Two words .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , if you have t wo and t hey ’re at t he edges , it ’s
like here and here ,
fe016 [ s] : and t here ’s speech here , t hen it doesn’t really help you ,
fe016 [ fh] : so , um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Thilo ’s won’t put down t wo separat e m arks in
t hat case [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ arp|s^ no] : Well it w it would , but , um , we don’t know
ex act ly where t he words are because t he t ranscriber gave us t wo
words in t his t im e bin
m e011 [ s^ aa|%−] : Thilo ’s will . But .
fe016 [ s^ no.%−] : and we don’t really know ,
fe008 [ s] : Well it ’s a m erging problem .
fe016 [ s] : I m ean ,
fe016 [ fg] : y eah it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : If you had a [ disfm arker] if you had a s if you had a
script which would [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I ’v e t hought about t his ,
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , if you have any ideas .
fe008 [ fh|s] : um , and I ’ve discussed [ disfm arker] I ’ve discussed it
wit h Thilo ,
fe016 [ %−] : I would [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ fh|s^ cs] : um , t he , I m ean , I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] in
principle I could im agine writ ing a script which would approxim at e it t o
som e degree ,
fe008 [ s] : but t here is t his problem of slippage ,
m e011 [ fg|s^ am ^ rt ] : Well m aybe [ disfm arker] Maybe t hat will get
enough of t he cases t o be useful .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
fe016 [ fg] : Right .

fe016 [ s] : I m ean , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat would be really helpful .
fe016 [ s] : That was sort of anot her possibilit y .
m e011 [ s] : You know s cuz it seem ed like m ost of t he cases are in fact
t he single word sort s ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : or at least a single phrase
m n017 [ b] : Mm m .
fe008 [ s] : Well t hey [ disfm arker] t hey can be st ret ched .
m e011 [ s^ e] : in m ost of t he bins .
fe008 [ s^ ng] : I wouldn’t m ake t hat generalizat ion
fe016 [ b^ rt ] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ df] : cuz som et im es people will say , " And t hen I " and t here
’s a long pause
fe008 [ s] : and finish t he sent ence
fe008 [ s.%−−] : and [ disfm arker] and som et im es it looks coherent and
[ disfm arker] and t he [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I m ean it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not a sim ple problem .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : But it ’s really [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : And t hen it ’s coupled wit h t he problem t hat som et im es ,
y ou know , wit h [ disfm arker] wit h a fricat ive you m ight get t he
beginning of t he word cut off
fe008 [ s] : and so it ’s coupled wit h t he problem t hat Thilo ’s isn’t
perfect eit her .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , we ’ve i t h it ’s like you have a m erging problem
plus [ disfm arker] so m erging plus t his problem of , uh , not
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ b] : Hm m !
fe008 [ s] : y i i if t he speech − nonspeech were perfect t o begin wit h ,
t he det ect or , t hat would already be an im provem ent ,
fe008 [ s] : but t hat ’s im possible , y ou know , i t hat ’s t oo m uch t o ask .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ b] : Yes .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And so i and m ay you know , I m ean , it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I t hink t hat t here always [ disfm arker] t h t here would have t o
be som e hand − t weaking ,
fe008 [ s] : but it ’s possible t hat a script could be writ t en t o m erge
t hose t wo t y pes of t hings .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I ’v e [ disfm arker] I ’ve discussed it wit h Thilo and I m ean
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ e] : in t erm s of not him doing it ,
fe008 [ s] : but we [ disfm arker] we discussed som e of t he param et ers
of t hat
fe008 [ s] : and how hard it would be t o [ disfm arker] in principle
[ disfm arker] t o writ e som et hing t hat would do t hat .
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , I guess in t he fut ure it won’t be as m uch as an
issue if t ranscribers are using t he t ight ened boundaries t o st art wit h ,

fe016 [ s] : t hen we have a good idea of where t he forced alignm ent is
const rained t o .
fe008 [ s] : Well , it ’s just , you know , a m at t er of we had t he revolut ion
[ disfm arker] we had t he revolut ion of im proved , uh , int erface , um ,
one m ont h t oo lat e ,
m e011 [ b] : Oh .
fe016 [ s^ no.%−] : So I ’m no I don’t know if t his
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Tools .
fe008 [ s] : but it ’s like , you know , it ’s wonderful t o have t he
rev olut ion ,
fe016 [ %−] : Oh it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s a [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : so it ’s just a m at t er of [ disfm arker] of , you know , from now
on we ’ll be able t o have t hings channelized t o begin wit h .
fe016 [ b] : yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : And we ’ll just have t o see how hard t hat is .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
fe008 [ s^ aa] : t hat ’s right .
m e011 [ fh|s] : So [ disfm arker] so whet her t he correct ions t ake t oo
m uch t im e .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right .
m e011 [ s] : I was just t hinking about t he fact t hat if Thilo ’s m issed
t hese short segm ent s , t hat m ight be quit e t im e − consum ing for t hem
t o insert t hem .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Good point .
fe016 [ s] : But he [ disfm arker] he also can adjust t his m inim um t im e
durat ion const raint and t hen what y ou get is noises m ost ly ,
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Spurious .
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : but t hat m ight be OK ,
m e011 [ s] : It m ight be easier t o delet e som et hing t hat ’s wrong t han
t o insert som et hing t hat ’s m issing .
fe016 [ %−] : an
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s.%−] : And you can also see in t he waveform [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qw^ rt ] : What do you t hink , Jane ?
fe016 [ s^ aa.%−] : exac
fe016 [ fg] : y eah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : If y ou can feel confident t hat what t he [ disfm arker]
y eah , t hat t here ’s act ually som et hing [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Cuz t hen [ disfm arker] t hen you just delet e it , and you
don’t hav e t o pick a t im e .
m e013 [ s] : t hat you ’re not gonna m iss som et hing ,

m e013 [ s^ bk] : yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−] : I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : Well t he problem is I [ disfm arker] you know [ disfm arker] I
[ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] it ’s a [ disfm arker] it ’s a really good
quest ion ,
fe008 [ s] : and I really find it a pain in t he neck t o delet e t hings
fe008 [ s^ df] : because you have t o get t he m ouse up t here on t he t
on t he t ext line
fe008 [ s] : and i and ot herwise y ou just use an arrow t o get down
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , i it depends on how lar
fe008 [ s] : t h t here ’s so m any ext ra t hings t hat would m ake it one of
t hem harder t han t he ot her , or [ disfm arker] or vice versa .
fe008 [ s] : It ’s not a sim ple quest ion .
fe008 [ s] : But , y ou know , I m ean , in principle , like , you know , if one
of t hem is easier t hen t o bias it t owards whichever one ’s easier .
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah , I guess t he sem ant ics aren’t clear when you
delet e a segm ent ,
m e011 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e011 [ s^ df] : Because you would say [ disfm arker] You would have t o
det erm ine what t he surroundings were .
fe016 [ s^ cs.%−−] : You could just say it ’s a noise , t hough , and writ e ,
y ou know , a post − processor will just [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−] : all you have t o do is just [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : If it ’s really a noise .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : or just say it ’s [ disfm arker] just put " X , " you know ,
like " not speech " or som et hing ,
fe016 [ s.%−] : and t hen you can get [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I t hink it ’s easier t o add t han delet e , frankly ,
fe016 [ b] : Yeah , or
fe008 [ s^ df] : because you have t o , uh , m aneuver around on t he
[ disfm arker] on bot h windows t hen .
m e011 [ qr^ d] : To add or t o delet e ?
fe008 [ s] : To delet e .
m e011 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : OK .
fe016 [ fg|%−] : Any ways , so I [ disfm arker] I guess [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ am ] : That [ disfm arker] Maybe t hat ’s an int erface issue
t hat m ight be addressable .
m e011 [ s] : But I t hink it ’s t he sem ant ics t hat are [ disfm arker] t hat
are quest ionable t o m e ,
fe008 [ s] : It ’s possible .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : t hat you delet e som et hing [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : So let ’s say som eone is t alking t o here , and t hen you
have a lit t le segm ent here .
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Well , is t hat part of t he speech ?
m e011 [ qy ] : Is it part of t he nonspeech ?

m e011 [ qw] : I m ean , w what do you em bed it in ?
fe016 [ s] : There ’s som et hing nice , t hough , about keeping , and t his
is probably anot her discussion , keeping t he st uff t hat Thilo ’s det ect or
det ect ed as possible speech and just m arking it as not speech t han
delet ing it .
fe016 [ s^ df] : Because t hen when y ou align it , t hen t he alignm ent can
[ disfm arker] you can put a reject m odel or what ever ,
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see .
m e011 [ s^ cs.%−] : So t hen t hey could just like put [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Oh t hat ’s what you m eant by just put an " X " t here .
fe016 [ s^ df] : and y ou ’re consist ent wit h t h t he aut om at ic syst em ,
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Uh , t hat ’s an int erest ing idea .
fe016 [ s.%−] : whereas if you delet e it [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bs] : So [ disfm arker] so all t hey [ disfm arker] So t hat all t hey
would have t o do is put like an " X " t here .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s.%−] : Yeah , or som e , y ou know , dum m y reject m od
m e011 [ s] : So blank for [ disfm arker] blank for silence , " S "
m e011 [ s] : " S " for speech , " X "
m e011 [ s] : " X " for som et hing else .
fe016 [ s^ 2] : what ev er ,
fe016 [ s^ bk] : y eah .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : That ’s act ually a bet t er way t o do it
fe016 [ s^ df.%−] : cuz t he a t he forced alignm ent will probably be m ore
consist ent t han [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ fg|s.%−−] : Well , like , I t hink t here ’s a com plicat ion which is t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat you can have speech and noise in s
fe016 [ s] : I m ean if it ’s just as easy ,
fe016 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ fh|s] : uh , you know , on t he sam e channel , t he sam e speaker
,
fe008 [ fh|s] : so now som et im es y ou get a ni m icrophone pop
fe008 [ fh|s] : and , uh , I m ean , t here ’re t hese fuzzy hybrid cases ,
fe008 [ s] : and t hen t he problem wit h t he boundaries t hat have t o be
shift ed around .
fe008 [ s] : It ’s not a sim ple [ disfm arker] not a sim ple problem .
fe016 [ fg|qy.%−−] : Anyway , quick quest ion , t hough , at a high level do
people t hink ,
fe016 [ s] : let ’s just say t hat we ’re m oving t o t his new era of like using
t he , um , pre − segm ent ed t you know , non − synchronous
conv ersat ions ,
fe016 [ qr.%−] : does it m ake sense t o t ry t o t ake what we have now ,
which are t he ones t hat , you know , we have recognit ion on which are
sy nchronous and not t im e − t ight ened , and t ry t o get som et hing out of
t hose for sort of purposes of illust rat ing t he st ruct ure and t he nat ure
of t he m eet ings , or is it bet t er t o just , y ou know , forget t hat and t r
m e011 [ s] : Well , I t hink we ’ll have t o , event ually .

fe016 [ %−] : I m ean , it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.x] : And m y hope was t hat we would be able t o use t he
forced alignm ent t o get it .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e011 [ s.%−] : But if we can’t [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : That was everybody ’s hope .
m e011 [ s^ r.%−] : But if we can’t , t hen m aybe we just have t o
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ am .%−−] : And m aybe we can for t he non − lapel , but
fe016 [ qy .%−−] : is it wort h [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : if we can’t t hen we can fake it even if we ’re [ disfm arker]
we report , you know , we ’re wrong t went y percent of t he t im e or t en
percent of t he t im e .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : Well , I ’m t hinking [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qr.x ] : are y ou t alking about for a paper , or are t alking about
for t he corpus .
fe016 [ h|s^ ba] : Uh [ disfm arker] uh , t hat ’s a good quest ion act ually .
m e011 [ s.%−] : I m ean cuz for t he corpus it would be nice if everyt hing
were [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ ba^ r] : Act ually t hat ’s a good quest ion
fe016 [ s^ df] : because we ’d have t o com plet ely redo t hose m eet ings ,
and we hav e like t en of t hem now .
m e011 [ s] : We wouldn’t have t o re − do t hem ,
m e011 [ s] : we would just have t o edit t hem .
fe008 [ s] : Well , and also , I m ean , I st ill haven’t [ disfm arker] I st ill
haven’t given up on forced alignm ent .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : No , you ’re right ,
fe016 [ %−] : act ually [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−] : I t hink t hat when Brian com es , t his ’ll be uh an
int erest ing aspect t o ask him as well b
m e011 [ qw.%−−] : When [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : when Brian Kingsbury com es .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh , Brian .
m e011 [ s] : You s I t hought you said Ryan .
m e011 [ s] : And it ’s like , " Who ’s Ryan ? "
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : Yeah , good quest ion .
fe008 [ fh|s] : Well , Ryan could com e .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : Uh , no , t hat ’s a good point , t hough ,
fe016 [ s^ df.%−−] : because for feat ure ext ract ion like for prosody or
som et hing , I m ean , t he m eet ings we hav e now ,
fe016 [ s] : it ’s a good chunk of dat a [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
fe016 [ s^ co.%−−] : we need t o get a decent f
fe016 [ s^ t ] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : That ’s what m y hope has been ,

fe016 [ s^ cs] : So we should at least t ry it even if we can’t ,
fe008 [ s] : and t hat ’s what [ disfm arker] t hat ’s what [ disfm arker] you
know , ever since t he [ disfm arker] t he February m eet ing t hat I
t ranscribed from last year , forced alignm ent has been on t he
[ disfm arker] on t he t able as a way of cleaning t hem up lat er .
fe016 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e011 [ s^ m ] : On t he t able ,
m e011 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe008 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and so I ’m hopeful t hat t hat ’s possible .
fe008 [ s] : I know t hat t here ’s com plicat ion in t he overlap sect ions
and wit h t he lapel m ikes ,
m n017 [ %−] : There ’s [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ cs.%−−] : I m ean , we m ight be able , at t he very worst , we
can get t ranscribers t o correct t he cases where [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , y ou sort of have a good est im at e where t hese
places are because t he recognit ion ’s so poor .
fe016 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
fe016 [ s.%−] : And so you ’re [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : Yeah , we were never just gonna go wit h t hese as t he final
alignm ent s .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : I agree .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa^ r] : I agree .
m e018 [ s] : We were always gonna run t hem past som ebody .
fe016 [ s^ bs] : So we need som e way t o push t hese first chunk of
m eet ings int o a st at e where we get good alignm ent s .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Absolut ely .
m n017 [ s^ cc] : I ’m probably going t o spend anot her day or so t rying
t o im prove t hings by , um , [ vocalsound] [ v ocalsound] by using , um ,
acoust ic adapt at ion .
m n017 [ fh|s] : Um , t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] Right now I ’m using
t he unadapt ed m odels for t he forced alignm ent s ,
m n017 [ s^ cs] : and it ’s possible t hat you get considerably bet t er
result s if y ou , uh , m anage t o adapt t he , [ vocalsound] uh , phone
m odels t o t he speaker and t he reject m odel t o t he [ disfm arker] t o
[ disfm arker] t o all t he ot her speech .
m n017 [ fh] : Um , so
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Could you [ disfm arker] could you at t he sam e t im e
adapt t he reject m odel t o t he speech from all t he ot her channels ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : That ’s what he just said .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : That ’s what he was saying .
m n017 [ s^ aa] : That ’s what I just said .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .

m e018 [ s^ ng] : Oh , not just t he speech from t hat [ disfm arker] of t he
ot her people from t hat channel ,
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e018 [ s] : but t he speech from t he a act ual ot her channels .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh , oh , I see .
m n017 [ h] : Um ,
m e011 [ s^ ar] : I don’t t hink so .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e011 [ s] : I don’t t hink t hat would work ,
m n017 [ %−] : No , it [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e011 [ s^ df.%−−] : Because you ’d [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : A lot of it ’s dom inat ed by channel propert ies .
m n017 [ %−] : t h
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Ex act ly .
fe016 [ s] : But what you do wanna do is t ake t he , even if it ’s klugey ,
t ake t he segm ent s [ disfm arker] t he synchronous segm ent s , t he ones
from t he HLT paper , where only t hat speaker was t alking .
m n017 [ s.%−] : So y ou want t o u
fe016 [ s] : Use t hose for adapt at ion ,
fe016 [ s^ df] : cuz if y ou [ disfm arker] if you use everyt hing , t hen you
get all t he cross − t alk in t he adapt at ion , and it ’s just sort of blurred .
m n017 [ s^ ba] : That ’s a good point .
m n017 [ b] : Yep .
m e018 [ s.%−] : If you [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : And t hat we know , I m ean , we have t hat .
fe016 [ s] : And it ’s about roughly t wo − t hirds , I m ean , very roughly
av eraged .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : That ’s not com plet ely negligible .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : Like a t hird of it is bad for adapt at ion or so .
m e011 [ s] : Cool .
m e011 [ s.%−] : I t hought it was higher t han t hat , t hat ’s pr
fe016 [ s] : It really [ disfm arker] it depends a lot .
fe016 [ s] : This is just sort of an overall [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s] : Well I know what we ’re not t urning in t o Eurospeech ,
m e013 [ s] : a redo of t he HLT paper .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : That [ disfm arker] I don’t wanna do t hat ,
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , I ’m doing t hat for AVIOS .
m e013 [ fh] : but .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .

fe016 [ s^ ba] : But I t hink we ’re [ disfm arker] oh , Morgan ’s t alk went
v ery well , I t hink .
m e013 [ s^ j] : Bleep .
m e011 [ s^ j^ r] : Uh , " bleep " .
m e011 [ s^ j] : Yeah , really .
fe016 [ s.%−] : I t hink Morgan ’s t alk went v ery well it woke [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Ex cellent .
fe016 [ s] : y ou know , it was really a well present ed [ disfm arker] and
got people laughing [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : Som e good jokes in it ?
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Especially t he bat t eried m et er popping up ,
m e011 [ s] : t hat was hilarious .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Right when you were t alking about t hat .
m e013 [ s] : You know , t hat wa t hat was t he bat t ery m et er saying t hat
it was fully charged ,
m e011 [ s^ m ] : It ’s full .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : yeah .
fe008 [ s] : You said , " Speaking about energy " , or [ vocalsound]
som et hing .
m e011 [ s] : But t hat was funny .
m e013 [ b^ rt ] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : He [ disfm arker] he [ disfm arker] he was ont o t he bullet

lit t le hand − held , and t rying t o get lower power and so on ,
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That was very nice .
m n017 [ s] : Po − low power
m e011 [ s] : and Microsoft pops up a lit t le window saying " Your

fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s great .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah , y eah , yeah .
m e011 [ s^ j^ rt ] : I ’m t hinking about script ing t hat for m y t alk , you

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : No I m ean , i in [ disfm arker] in your case , I m ean ,
y ou were joking about it , but , I m ean , your case t he fact t hat your
t alking about sim ilar t hings at a couple of conferences , it ’s not
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : t hese are conferences t hat have d really different

m e013 [ s] : Whereas HLT and [ disfm arker] and Eurospeech , pret t y
[ disfm arker] pret t y [ disfm arker] pret t y sim ilar , so I [ disfm arker] I
[ disfm arker] I can’t see really just put t ing in t he sam e t hing ,
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Are t oo close ,
m e011 [ s^ bk] : y eah .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : No , I d I don’t t hink t hat paper is really [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg] : but [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−] : t he HLT paper is really m ore of a int roduct ion − t o − t he −
project paper , and , um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b^ rt ] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , for Eurospeech we want som e result s
m e011 [ s^ e] : if we can get t hem .

m e011 [ s^ cs.%−] : Maybe it wasn’t just t ight ened enough , or
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : Maybe t he [ disfm arker] yeah , t he s t hing t hat you

m e018 [ fg|s] : Act ually if [ disfm arker] if you have a larger head , t hat
m ike ’s got t a go fart her away which m eans t he [ disfm arker] t he

fe016 [ s^ bk] : oh .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ t c] : Any way .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : Cuz , I ’m just t hinking , you know , we were [ disfm arker]
we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’ve been t alking about changing t he m ikes , uh ,
for a while ,
m e013 [ s] : see ya .
m e001 [ s.%−] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : and if t hese aren’t [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : acoust ically t hey seem really good ,
m e011 [ s] : but if t hey ’re not com fort able , we have t he sam e
problem s we hav e wit h t hese st upid t hings .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I t hink it ’s com
fe008 [ s] : This is t he first t im e I ’v e worn t his ,
fe008 [ s] : I find it very com fort able .
m e011 [ s] : I find it very com fort able t oo , but , uh , it looked like
Andreas was hav ing problem s ,
m e011 [ s.%−] : and I t hink Morgan was say ing it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ h|s] : Well , but I had it on [ disfm arker] I had it on t his m orning
and it was fine .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ^ t 3] : Can I see t hat ?
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh ,
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : oh y ou did wear it t his m orning ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ t 3] : OK , it ’s off , so you can put it on .
m e018 [ s^ t 3] : I [ disfm arker] y eah , I don’t want it on ,
m e018 [ s] : I just [ disfm arker] I just want t o , um , say what I t hink is a
problem wit h t his .
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : If you are wearing t his over your ears and you ’ve got it
all t he way out here ,
m e018 [ s] : t hen t he balance is gonna want t o pull it t his way .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e018 [ s.%−] : Where as if som ebody wit h a sm aller head has it back
here ,
m e011 [ s^ 2] : It ’s m ore balanced .

m e018 [ qy ^ d^ f^ rt ] : right ?
fe016 [ s.%−] : So we have t o
fe008 [ s^ fe] : Oh !
m e018 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s.%−] : Then it [ disfm arker] t hen it falls back t his way so it ’s
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg|s] : Well wh what it ’s supposed t o do is t he backst rap is
supposed t o be under your crown ,
m e011 [ s.%−−] : and so t hat should be [ disfm arker] should be
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : if it ’s right against y our head t here , which is what it ’s
supposed t o be , t hat balances it
fe008 [ b] : Ah .
m e011 [ s] : so it doesn’t slide up .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : So t his is supposed t o be under t hat lit t le
prot uberance .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : Yep , right [ disfm arker] right below [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : if you feel t he back of y our head , you feel a lit t le
lum p ,
m e011 [ fh|s] : um , and so it ’s supposed t o be right under t hat .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : So it ’s really supposed t o go m ore like t his t han like
t his .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yes , exact ly .
m e018 [ qy.%−] : But t hen isn’t t hat going t o [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : That [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat t ilt s ,
m e018 [ s] : Well , I guess you can cont rol t hat .
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e011 [ s] : In lot s and lot s of different ways .
fe016 [ s^ j^ rt ] : So I ’m not saying anyt hing about bias t owards sm all
headsize ,
m e011 [ qy ^ 2^ d^ rt ] : About heads ?
fe016 [ s.%−] : but does seem , uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : It would be an advant age .
fe008 [ fg|s] : Well , wonder if it ’s [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] if he was
wearing it ov er his hair inst ead of under his hair .
m e013 [ s^ cs^ j.%−−] : Well , we should [ disfm arker] We shou we should
work on com pressing t he heads , and [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.%−] : I t hink probably it was [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : It probably just wasn’t t ight enough t o t he back of his
head .
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : I m ean , so t he direct ions do t alk about bending it t o
y our size , which is not really what we want .
m e018 [ s^ j] : The ot her t hing t hat would do it would be t o hang a five
pound weight off t he back .

m e013 [ s^ aa^ j] : Yeah
fe016 [ s^ aa^ j] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ ba^ j] : t hat ’s good !
fe008 [ qw^ br] : What did you say ?
m e011 [ %] : wh
fe016 [ %−−] : A lit t le ,
m e013 [ s^ j^ m ] : Hang a five pound weight off t he [ disfm arker] off t he
back .
m e011 [ s] : We did t hat [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ h] : um ,
m e018 [ s^ j^ r] : Hang a five pound weight off t he back .
m e011 [ s] : We [ disfm arker] at Boeing I used [ disfm arker] I was doing
augm ent ed realit y so t hey had head − m ount s on ,
m e013 [ s^ r] : Weight .
m e011 [ s] : and we [ disfm arker] we had a lit t le jury − rigged one wit h a
welder ’s helm et ,
m e018 [ s^ 2^ rt ] : Count er − balance .
m e011 [ s] : and we had just a bag wit h a bunch of m arbles in it
[ v ocalsound] as a count er − balance .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Or m aybe t his could be helpful just for evening t he
conv ersat ion bet ween people .
m e013 [ s^ cs^ j] : If people [ disfm arker] t hose who t alk a lot have t o
wear heav ier weight s or som et hing ,
m e011 [ b] : Yeah !
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] um ,
m e011 [ fg] : Anyway .
m e013 [ fg|qw] : um , so , uh , what was I gonna say ?
m e013 [ s] : Oh , y eah , I was gonna say , uh , I had t hese , uh ,
conv ersat ions wit h NIST folks also while I was t here
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and , uh , um , so t hey [ disfm arker] t hey
have t heir [ disfm arker] t heir plan for a room , uh , wit h , um , m ikes in
t he m iddle of t he t able , and , uh , close − m ount ed m ikes ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and t hey ’re t alking about close − m ount ed and lapels ,
just cuz
fe016 [ s^ 2] : And arrays ,
m e011 [ s^ aa^ m ] : And arrays ,
m e013 [ s^ aa^ m ] : sort of [ disfm arker] and t he array .
m e013 [ s.%−] : Yeah , so t hey were [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : y ep .
fe016 [ s.%−] : which is t he i int erest ing [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : And cam eras .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : and v ideo , right .

m e013 [ s] : And yeah , like m ult iple [ disfm arker] m ult iple video
cam eras cov erin covering every [ disfm arker] everybody [ disfm arker]
ev ery place in t he room ,
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : uh , t he [ disfm arker] yeah [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t he m ikes in t he m iddle , t he head − m ount ed m ikes , t he
lapel m ikes , t he array , uh , wit h [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : well , t here ’s som e discussion of fift y − nine ,
m e011 [ s^ bc] : Fift y − nine elem ent s .
m e013 [ s] : t hey m ight go down t o fift y − seven
m e013 [ s^ df] : Because , uh , t here is , uh , som e pressure from a
couple people at t he m eet ing for t hem t o use a KEMAR head .
fe016 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : I forget what KEMAR , uh , st ands for ,
m e013 [ s] : but what it is is it ’s dum m y head t hat is very specially
designed ,
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh , t hat ’s right .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and , so what t hey ’re
act ually doing is t hey ’re really [ disfm arker] t here ’s really t wo
recording syst em s .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : That ’s a great idea .
m e013 [ s] : So t hey m ay not be precisely synchronous , but t he but
t here ’s t wo [ disfm arker] t wo recording syst em s ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : one wit h , I t hink , t went y − four channels , and one wit h
six t y − four channels .
m e013 [ s^ e] : And t he sixt y − four channel one is for t he array ,
m e013 [ s] : but t hey ’ve got som e em pt y channels t here ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : and anyway t hey [ disfm arker] like t hey ’re saying t hey
m ay giv e up a couple or som et hing if [ disfm arker] for [ disfm arker] for
t he KEMAR head if t hey go [ disfm arker] go wit h t hat .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Yeah , it is a good idea .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , h uh , J Jonat han Fiscus did say t hat , uh , t hey have
lot s of soft ware for doing calibrat ion for skew and offset bet ween
channels
m e013 [ fh] : So .
fe016 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m
m e011 [ s] : and t hat t hey ’ve found t hat ’s just not a big deal .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah , I ’m not [ pause] t oo worried about t hat .
m e013 [ s] : I was t hinking [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−] : But t hey ’re st ill planning t o do like fake [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Scenario − based .
fe016 [ s] : t hey hav e t o do som et hing like t hat ,

m e011 [ s^ aa] : Y right .
m e011 [ s] : Their [ disfm arker] t heir legal issues won’t allow t hem t o do
ot herwise .
fe016 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : But it sounded like t hey were [ pause] pret t y well t hought
out
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , t h t hat ’s t rue .
m e011 [ s] : and t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re gonna be real m eet ings ,
m e011 [ s] : it ’s just t hat t hey ’re wit h st r wit h people who would not be
m eet ing ot herwise .
fe008 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ qr] : Did [ disfm arker] did t hey give a t alk on t his or was t his
inform al ?
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ s^ ar] : No .
fe016 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e011 [ s] : It ’s just inform al .
m e013 [ s] : No , we just had som e discussions , various discussions
wit h t hem .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , I also sat and chat t ed wit h several of t he NIST folks
.
m e011 [ s] : They seem ed like a good group .
m e018 [ qw] : What was t he , um [ disfm arker] t he paper by , um , Lori
Lam el t hat y ou m ent ioned ?
m e013 [ h|s] : Um , y eah , we sh we should just have you [ disfm arker]
have y ou read it , but , I m ea ba i i uh , we ’ve all got t hese lit t le
proceedings ,
fe008 [ h] : Mm m , yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : but , um , basically , it was about , um , uh , going t o a
new t ask where you have insufficient dat a and using [ disfm arker] using
dat a from som et hing else , and adapt ing , and how well t hat works .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : Uh , so in [ disfm arker] in fact it was pret t y relat ed t o
what Liz and Andreas did , uh , ex cept t hat t his was not wit h m eet ing
st uff , it was wit h
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ fh|qy ^ rt ] : uh , like I t hink t hey s didn’t t hey st art off wit h
Broadcast News syst em ?
m e011 [ s^ na] : The − t heir Broadcast News was t heir acoust ic m odels
m e013 [ s^ rt .%−] : And t hen t hey went t o [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : and t hen all t he ot her t asks were m uch sim pler .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .

m e011 [ s^ rt ] : So t hey were com m and and cont rol and t hat sort of
t hing .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : TI − digit s was one of t hem , and , uh , Wall St reet
Journal .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : What was t heir rough [ disfm arker] what was t heir
conclusion ?
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : Yeah , read Wall St reet Journal .
m e011 [ s] : It works .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : Well , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s a good paper , I m ean
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , t hat was one of t he ones t hat I liked .
fe016 [ %−] : Bring t he [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : That [ disfm arker] It not only works , in som e cases it was
bet t er ,
m e011 [ s] : which I t hought was pret t y int erest ing ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : but t hat ’s cuz t hey didn’t cont rol for param et ers .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ s] : You know , t he Broadcast News net s were [ disfm arker] not
net s ,
m e013 [ s^ am ] : Probably .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : acoust ic m odels [ com m ent ] were a lot m ore com plex .
m e018 [ qr] : Did t hey ever t ry going [ disfm arker] going t he ot her

m e011 [ s^ nd] : n Not in t hat paper .
m e018 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s] : That m ight be hard .
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah , well , one of t he big problem s wit h t hat is
[ disfm arker] is oft en t he sim pler t ask isn’t fully [ disfm arker] doesn’t
have all t he phones in it ,
m e011 [ s] : and t hat [ disfm arker] t hat m akes it very hard .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : But I ’ve done t he sam e t hing .
m e011 [ s] : I ’v e been using Broadcast News net s for digit s ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ f^ rt ] : like for t he spr speech prox y t hing t hat I did ?
m e011 [ s] : That ’s what I did .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ b] : sure .
m e011 [ fh|s] : So . It works .

m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah , and t hey have [ disfm arker] I m ean [ disfm arker]
t hey have bet t er adapt at ion t han we had t han t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
sy st em ,
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ %−] : so t hey [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ h] : um ,
m e011 [ s^ bc] : You m ean t hey hav e som e .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : y eah , we should probably what would [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : act ually what we should do , uh , I haven’t said anyt hing
about t his ,
m e013 [ s^ cs^ e] : but probably t he five of us should pick out a paper
or t wo t hat [ disfm arker] t hat , uh , you know , got our int erest ,
m e013 [ s^ cc] : and we should go around t he room at one of t he
Tuesday lunch m eet ings and say , y ou know , what [ disfm arker] what
was good about t he conference ,
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Present .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Do a t rip report .
m e013 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : yeah .
fe016 [ s] : Well , t he sum m arizat ion st uff was int erest ing ,
fe016 [ s^ bd^ no] : I m ean , I don’t know anyt hing about t hat field ,
fe016 [ s.%−−] : but for t his proposal on m eet ing sum m arizat ion ,
fe016 [ fh|s] : um , I m ean , it ’s sort of a far cry
fe016 [ s^ df] : because t hey weren’t working wit h m eet ing t ype dat a ,
fe016 [ s] : but he got sort of an overview on som e of t he different

fe016 [ fh] : so .
fe016 [ s.%−] : Well t here ’re [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : A lot of different ones .
fe016 [ s] : t his was t he last day ,
fe008 [ s.%−] : R I t hink [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : but , I m ean , t here ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a huge field and
probably t he groups t here m ay not be represent at ive of t he field ,
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know exact ly t hat everyone subm it s t o
t his part icular conference ,
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Was [ disfm arker] were t here folks from BBN present ing
?

m e011 [ s] : It [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it was t he only one
[ disfm arker] It was t he only one t hat had any sort of real disagreem ent

fe016 [ s.%−] : The dat a issue com es up all t he t i
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s^ ng] : Well , I didn’t have as m uch disagreem ent as I would

m e013 [ s^ e] : but I didn’t wanna [ disfm arker] I wouldn I didn’t wanna

m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh , it just would hav e been , you know , m e get t ing up
t o be argum ent at iv e ,
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker] but , uh ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , t he m issing t hi
m e013 [ fh|s] : so [ disfm arker] so what t hey were saying [ disfm arker] it
’s one of t hese t hings [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] you know , all you
need is m ore dat a , sort of [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : But I m ea i wh it [ disfm arker] @ @ t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat
’s dissing it , uh , im properly ,
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , it was a nice st udy .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−] : Uh , t hey were doing t his [ disfm arker] it wasn’t word −
sense disam biguat ion , it was [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ ar.%−−] : Yeah [ disfm arker] yeah [ disfm arker] yeah
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg|s^ ng] : Well , it sort of was .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : was it w was it word − sense ?
m e011 [ s] : But it was [ disfm arker] it was a very sim ple case of " t o "
v ersus " t oo " versus " t wo " and " t here " , " t heir " , " t hey ’re "
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yes .
fe016 [ s.%−] : And t here and t heir and [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ fg] : Yeah , yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : OK .
fe016 [ s.%−] : and t hat you could do bet t er wit h m ore dat a , I m ean ,
t hat ’s clearly st at ist ically [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg] : Right .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s] : And so , what t hey did was t hey had t hese different
kinds of learning m achines , and t hey had different am ount s of dat a ,
m e013 [ s] : and so t hey did like , you know , eight different m et hods
t hat ev erybody , y ou know , uh , argues about [ disfm arker] about , " Oh
m y [ disfm arker] m y kind of learning m achine is bet t er t han your kind of
learning m achine . "
m e013 [ fh|s] : And , uh , t hey were [ disfm arker] st art ed off wit h a
m illion words t hat t hey used ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : which was evident ly a num ber t hat a lot of people doing
t hat part icular kind of t ask had been using .
m e013 [ s] : So t hey went up , being Microsoft , t hey went up t o a billion
.
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t hen t hey had t his log scale showing a
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s.%−] : y ou know , and [ disfm arker] and nat urally everyt hing
get s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ j] : Them being beep , [ com m ent ] t hey went off t o a billion .
m e013 [ %−] : t hey [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : well , it ’s a big com pany ,
m e013 [ s] : I didn’t [ disfm arker] I didn’t m ean it as a ne anyt hing
negat ive ,
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : but i i i
fe016 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : You m ean t he bigger t he com pany t he m ore
words t hey use for t raining ?
m e011 [ fg|s] : Well , I t hink t he reason t hey can do t hat , is t hat t hey
assum ed t hat t ext t hat t hey get off t he web , like from Wall St reet
Journal , is correct , and edit it .
m e011 [ s^ df] : So t hat ’s what t hey used as t raining dat a .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : It ’s just saying if it ’s in t his corpus it ’s correct .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : But , I m ean , yes .
m e013 [ s] : Of course t here was t he kind of effect t hat , you know ,
one would ex pect t hat [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] t hat you got bet t er
and bet t er perform ance wit h m ore and m ore dat a .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , but t he [ disfm arker] t he real point was t hat t he
[ disfm arker] t he different learning m achines are sort of all over t he
place ,

m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and by [ disfm arker] by going up
significant ly in dat a you can hav e m uch bigger effect t hen by swit ching
learning m achines
m e013 [ s] : and furt herm ore which learning m achine was on t op kind
of depended on where you were in t his pict ure ,
m e013 [ fh] : so ,
m e018 [ s] : This was m y concern about t he recognizer in Aurora .
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ qw^ d.%−−] : That [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ m .%−] : That t he differences we ’re seeing in t he front − end
is b
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ 2^ rt ] : Are irrelevant .
m e018 [ s^ aa^ m ] : are irrelevant
m e018 [ s] : once y ou get a real recognizer at t he back − end .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ qy ^ rt ] : If you add m ore dat a ?
fe016 [ qrr.%−] : Or [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : You know ?
fe016 [ b] : Huh .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s^ am ] : could well be .
m e013 [ fh|s] : So [ disfm arker] so , I m ean , t hat was [ disfm arker] t hat
was kind of , you know , it ’s a good point ,
m e013 [ s] : but t he problem I had wit h it was t hat t he im plicat ions out
of t his was t hat , uh , t he kind of choices y ou m ake about learning
m achines were t herefore irrelev ant
m e013 [ s] : which is not at [ disfm arker] n t as for as I know in
[ disfm arker] in t asks I ’m m ore fam iliar wit h @ @ is not at all t rue .
m e013 [ s] : What i what is [ disfm arker] is t rue is t hat different learning
m achines hav e different propert ies ,
m e013 [ s] : and you wanna know what t hose propert ies are .
m e013 [ s] : And som eone else sort of im plied t hat well we s y ou know ,
a all t he st udy of learning m achine we st ill don’t know what t hose
propert ies are .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : We don’t know t hem perfect ly , but we know t hat som e
kinds use m ore m em ory and [ disfm arker] and som e ot her kinds use
m ore com put at ion
m e013 [ s.%−] : and som e are [ disfm arker] are hav have lim it ed kind of
discrim inat ion , but are just easy t o use , and ot hers are [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : But doesn’t t heir conclusion just sort of
[ disfm arker] you could have guessed t hat before t hey even st art ed ?
m e018 [ s^ df] : Because if you assum e t hat t hese learning t hings get
bet t er and bet t er and bet t er ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : You would guess [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ s] : t hen as you approach [ disfm arker] t here ’s a point where
y ou can’t get any bet t er ,
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e018 [ s] : You get everyt hing right .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−] : It ’s just no [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg.%] : But [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ar] : No , but t here was st ill a spread .
m e018 [ s] : So t hey ’re all approaching .
m e011 [ s^ nd.%−−] : They weren’t all up
m e011 [ s^ bc^ nd] : They weren’t converging .
m e011 [ s^ df] : They were all st ill spread .

m e011 [ %−] : But t hey [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right , right .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Sure .

m e011 [ s] : All t he t asks were st ill im proving when t hey hit a billion .

m e013 [ s] : Ev ent ually .
m e013 [ s.%−] : O one would

m e018 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Oh t hey didn’t ?
m e011 [ s^ df] : They just swit ched posit ion .
m e013 [ h] : Well [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : well t hat ’s get t ing cl

m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ s^ df] : but [ disfm arker] but , uh , I t hink it would be irnt u int u

m e013 [ fh|s^ rt ] : I m ean , I t hink som ebody w w let ’s see who was

fe016 [ s^ na] : Well it ’s different for different t asks .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s.%] : It was Liz .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ b] : yeah .
fe016 [ s] : So it depends a lot on whet her , you know , it [ disfm arker]
disam biguat ion is exact ly t he case where m ore dat a is bet t er ,
fe016 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe016 [ s] : You ’re [ disfm arker] you ’re [ disfm arker] you can assum e

wouldn’t generalize ,
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ fh] : so .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : But , I t hink one of t heir p They [ disfm arker] t hey had a

m e011 [ fh] : so .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ t c.x ] : But anyway , I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s
[ disfm arker] it ’s just t he [ disfm arker] t he i it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
