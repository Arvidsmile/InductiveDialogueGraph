t o go ,
m e013 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g.%] : Right ?
m e013 [ s] : That was [ disfm arker] t hat was sort of t he point .
m e013 [ fh|s^ t ^ t c] : So , uh [ pause] I had asked act ually anybody who
had any ideas for an agenda [ pause] t o send it t o m e and no one did .
m e013 [ fh] : So ,
m e011 [ s] : So we all forgot .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh ,
fe008 [ s] : From last t im e I want ed t o [ disfm arker] Uh [ pause] [ pause]
The [ disfm arker] An iss uh [ pause] one t opic from last t im e .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right ,

m e013 [ s^ t ] : s OK , so one it em for an agenda is uh [ pause] Jane has
som e uh [ v ocalsound] uh som e research t o t alk about , research
issues .
m e013 [ fh|s^ bs] : Um [ pause] and [ pause] Uh , Adam has som e short
research issues .
m e011 [ s] : And I hav e som e [ pause] short research issues .
m e013 [ s] : Um , I have a [ pause] list of t hings t hat I t hink were done
ov er t he last t hree m ont hs
m e013 [ s] : I was supposed t o [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] send off , uh
[ pause] and , um [ pause] I [ disfm arker] I sent a not e about it t o uh
[ disfm arker] t o Adam and Jane
m e013 [ s^ cc] : but I t hink I ’ll just run t hrough it [ pause] also and see
if som eone t hinks it ’s inaccurat e or [ pause] uh insufficient .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : A list t hat you have t o send off t o who ?
m e013 [ h|s] : Uh , t o uh uh , IBM .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n005 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : They ’re , you know [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fh|s^ cc] : Um , So , uh [ pause] so , I ’ll go t hrough t hat .
m e013 [ fh|qo^ d^ rt ] : Um , [ pause] And , Anyt hing else ? [ pause]
anyone want s t o t alk about ?
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e013 [ fh] : OK .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ^ t c] : What about t he , um [ disfm arker] your t rip ,
y est erday ?
m e013 [ h] : Um .
m e013 [ s] : Sort of off − t opic I guess .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Cuz t hat ’s [ pause] Cuz t hat was all [ disfm arker] all
about t he , uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e013 [ s^ cc] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I can chat wit h you about
t hat [ pause] off − line .
m e013 [ s] : That ’s anot her t hing .
m e013 [ fh|qo^ d^ rt ] : Um , And , Any t hing else ?
m e013 [ qo^ d] : Not hing else ?
m e013 [ fh|s^ t c] : Uh , t here ’s a [ disfm arker] I m ean , t here is a
[ disfm arker] [ pause] a , um [ pause] uh [ pause] t elephone call
t om orrow , [ pause] which will be a conference call [ pause] t hat som e
of us are involved in [ pause] for uh a possible proposal .
m e013 [ s^ co.%−] : Um , we ’ll t alk [ disfm arker] we ’ll t alk about it next
week if [ disfm arker] if som et hing [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Do you want m e t o [ pause] be t here for t hat ?
m e011 [ s] : I not iced you C C ’ ed m e , but I wasn’t act ually a recipient .
m e011 [ s] : I didn’t quit e know what t o m ake of t hat .

m e013 [ h|s^ co] : Uh Well , we ’ll t alk [ disfm arker] t alk about t hat aft er
our m eet ing .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ fg] : Uh , OK .
m e013 [ s^ bs^ t ^ t c] : So it sounds like t he [ disfm arker] t he t hree m ain
t hings t hat we hav e t o t alk about are , uh t his list , uh Jane and
[ disfm arker] Jane and Adam have som e research it em s , and , ot her
t han t hat , anyt hing , [ pause] as usual , [ pause] anyt hing goes beyond
t hat .
m e013 [ s^ bk|qh^ co^ t ] : OK , uh , Jane , since [ disfm arker] since you
were sort of cut off last t im e why don’t we st art wit h yours ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : m ake sure we get t o it .
fe008 [ s^ cc] : OK , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s very [ pause] eh [ disfm arker] it
’s [ pause] v ery brief , I m ean [ disfm arker] just let m e [ disfm arker] just
hand t hese out .
fe008 [ s^ fe] : Oops .
m e011 [ qr] : Is t his t he sam e as t he em ail or different ?
fe008 [ s] : It ’s slight ly different .
m n014 [ s^ ft ] : Thanks .
fe008 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] [ pause] basically t he sam e .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ qy ^ 2^ d^ rt ] : Sam e idea ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : But , sam e idea .
fe008 [ s] : So , if you ’ve looked at t his y ou ’ve seen it before ,
fe008 [ s] : so [ pause] Basically , [ vocalsound] um [ pause] as you know
, uh [ pause] part of t he encoding [ pause] includes a m ark t hat
indicat es [ pause] an overlap .
fe008 [ s] : It ’s not indicat ed [ pause] wit h , um [ pause] uh , t ight
precision , it ’s just indicat ed t hat [ disfm arker] OK , so , It ’s indicat ed
t o [ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker] so t he people know [ pause] what part s
of sp which [ disfm arker] which st ret ches of speech were in t he clear ,
v ersus being ov erlapped by ot hers .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So , I [ pause] used t his m ark and , um [ pause] and , uh
[ pause] uh , [ pause] divided t he [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I wrot e a script [ pause] which divides t hings int o individual
m inut es , [ pause] of which we ended up wit h fort y [ pause] five , and a
lit t le bit .
fe008 [ s] : And , uh [ pause] you know , m inut e zero , of course , is t he
first m inut e up t o [ pause] sixt y seconds .
m n014 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : And , um [ pause] What you can see is t he num ber of
ov erlaps [ pause] and t hen [ pause] t o t he right , [ pause] whet her t hey
inv olv e t wo speakers , t hree speakers , or m ore t han t hree speakers .

fe008 [ fh|s] : And , [ pause] um [ pause] and , what I was looking for sp
sp specifically was t he quest ion of [ pause] whet her t hey ’re dist ribut ed
ev enly t hroughout or whet her t hey ’re [ pause] burst s of t hem .
fe008 [ fh] : Um .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And [ pause] it looked t o m e as t hough [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : uh , y ou know [ disfm arker] y t his is just [ disfm arker] [ pause]
eh [ disfm arker] eh , t his would [ disfm arker] t his is not st at ist ically
[ pause] v erified , [ pause] but it [ pause] did look t o m e as t hough
t here are burst s t hroughout , rat her t han being [ pause] localized t o a
part icular region .
fe008 [ s] : The part down t here , where t here ’s t he m ax im um num ber
of [ disfm arker] [ pause] of , um [ pause] ov erlaps is an area where we
were discussing [ pause] [ vocalsound] whet her or not it would be
useful t o indi t o s t o [ pause] code [ pause] st ress , [ pause] uh ,
sent ence st ress [ pause] as possible indicat ion of , uh [ pause]
inform at ion ret riev al .
fe008 [ s] : So it ’s like , [ pause] you know , rat her , [ pause] lively
discussion t here .
m e013 [ qw] : What was [ disfm arker] what ’s t he [ disfm arker] t he
parent hesized st uff [ pause] t hat say s , like [ disfm arker] e t he first one
t hat says six ov erlaps and t hen t wo point eight ?
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh ,
fe008 [ s] : t h [ v ocalsound] [ pause] That ’s t he per cent .
m e013 [ b] : Mm m .
fe008 [ s] : So , six is , uh [ pause] t wo point eight percent [ pause] of
t he t ot al num ber of overlaps in t he [ pause] session .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Ah .
m n014 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : At t he very end , t his is when people were , [ pause] you
know , packing up t o go basically ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : t here ’s [ pause] t his final st uff ,
fe008 [ s^ no] : I t hink we [ disfm arker] [ pause] I don’t rem em ber where
t he digit s [ pause] fell .
fe008 [ s] : I ’d hav e t o look at t hat .
fe008 [ s] : But [ pause] t he final t hree t here are no overlaps at all .
fe008 [ s] : And [ pause] couple t im es t here [ pause] are not .
fe008 [ s] : So , i it seem s like it goes t hrough burst s [ pause] but , um
[ pause] t hat ’s kind of it .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : Now , [ pause] Anot her quest ion is [ pause] is t here
[ disfm arker] are t here [ pause] individual differences in whet her you ’re
likely t o be overlapped wit h or t o ov erlap wit h ot hers .

fe008 [ s.%−−] : And , again [ pause] I want t o em phasize t his is just one
[ pause] part icular [ pause] um [ disfm arker] [ pause] one part icular
m eet ing , and also t here ’s been no st at ist ical t est ing of it all , but
[ pause] I , um [ pause] I t ook t he coding of [ pause] t he [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I , y ou know , m y [ disfm arker] I had t his script [ pause] figure
out , um [ pause] who [ pause] was t he first speaker , who was t he
second speaker involved in a t wo − person overlap , I didn’t look at t he
ones inv olving t hree or m ore .
fe008 [ s] : And , um [ pause] [ pause] t his is how it breaks down in t he
indiv idual cells of [ pause] who t ended t o be overlapping m ost oft en
wit h who [ disfm arker] who else ,
fe008 [ s] : and [ pause] if you look at t he m arginal t ot als , which is t he
ones on t he right side and across t he bot t om , you get [ pause] t he
t ot als for an individual .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So , [ v ocalsound] um [ pause] If you [ pause] look at t he
bot t om , t hose are t he , um [ pause] num bers of overlaps in which
[ pause] um [ pause] Adam was inv olv ed as t he person doing t he
ov erlapping and if you look [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ fa] : I ’m sorry , but you ’re o alphabet ical , t hat ’s why I ’m
choosing you
fe008 [ s] : And t hen if you look across t he right , [ pause] t hen [ pause]
t hat ’s where he was t he [ pause] person who was t he sp first speaker
in t he pair [ pause] and got overlap overlapped wit h by som ebody .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m !
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : And , [ pause] t hen if you look down in t he sum m ary t able ,
[ pause] t hen y ou see t hat , um [ pause] t h t hey ’re differences in
[ pause] whet her a person got overlapped wit h or [ pause] overlapped
by .
m e011 [ qr.%−] : Is t his uh [ pause] just raw count s or is it [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : Raw count s .
m e011 [ s] : So it would be int erest ing t o see how m uch each person
spoke .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes , very t rue [ disfm arker] very t rue
m n005 [ b] : Yeah [ vocalsound] Yeah
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ t 1.%−] : Norm alized t o how m uch [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ na] : it would be good t o norm alize wit h respect t o t hat .
fe008 [ s] : Now on t he t able I did [ pause] t ake one st ep t oward , uh
[ pause] away from t he raw frequencies by put t ing , [ pause] uh [ pause]
percent ages .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So t hat t he percent age of t im e [ pause] of t he
[ disfm arker] of t he t im es t hat a person spoke , [ pause] what
percent age [ pause] eh , w

fe008 [ qw] : so . Of t he t im es a person spoke and furt herm ore was
inv olv ed in a t wo t wo − person overlap , [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] what
percent age of t he t im e were t hey t he overlapper and what percent of
t he t im e were t hey t h t he overlappee ?
fe008 [ s] : And t here , it looks like you see som e differences ,
fe008 [ s] : um , [ pause] t hat som e people t end t o be overlapped
[ pause] wit h m ore oft en t han t hey ’re ov erlapped ,
fe008 [ s] : but , of course , uh i e [ vocalsound] t his is just one m eet ing
, [ pause] uh [ pause] t here ’s no st at ist ical t est ing involved , and t hat
would be [ pause] required for a [ disfm arker] for a finding [ pause] of
[ pause] any [ pause] kind of [ pause] scient ific [ pause] reliabilit y .
m e013 [ s^ j] : S so , i it would be st at ist ically incorrect t o conclude from
t his t hat Adam t alked t oo m uch or som et hing .
m e011 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : No [ disfm arker] no act ually , t hat would be
act ually st at ist ically correct ,
fe008 [ fg] : No , no , no .
m e013 [ s^ aa.%] : Yeah , yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah , y eah .
m e011 [ %−−] : but
m n005 [ b] : Yeah , y eah .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , t hat ’s right .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : And I ’m [ pause] you know , I ’m [ disfm arker] I don’t see a
point of singling people out ,
m e013 [ s^ t 3] : Excuse m e .
fe008 [ s.%−] : now , t his is a case where obviously [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : B I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I rat her enjoyed it , but
[ disfm arker] but t his
m e018 [ s] : But t he num bers speak for t hem selves .
m n005 [ s^ t 3] : He ’s [ disfm arker] Yeah , yeah , yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s] : Yes , t hat ’s right , so you don’t nee OK .
fe008 [ s] : Well , [ vocalsound] y ou know , it ’s like [ disfm arker] I ’m not
[ disfm arker] I ’m not saying on t he t ape who did [ pause] bet t er or
worse
fe008 [ s^ df.%−−] : because [ pause] I don’t t hink t hat it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Sure .
fe008 [ %−−] : I [ pause] you know ,
fe008 [ s|s^ cs] : and [ disfm arker] and t h here ’s a case where of
course , hum an subject s people would say be sure t hat you anonym ize
t he result s , [ pause] and [ disfm arker] and , so , m ight as well do t his .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , when [ disfm arker] t his is what [ disfm arker] This is
act ually [ disfm arker] when Jane sent t his em ail first , is what caused
m e t o st art t hinking about anonym izing t he dat a .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Well , fair enough .

fe008 [ s^ bk^ r] : Fair enough .
fe008 [ s^ df] : And act ually , [ pause] you know , t he point is not about
an indiv idual , it ’s t he point about [ pause] t endencies t oward [ pause]
y ou know , different st yles , different speaker st yles .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Oh sure .
fe008 [ s] : And [ pause] it would be , you know [ pause] of course ,
[ pause] t here ’s also t he quest ion of what t ype of overlap was t his ,
and w what were t hey ,
fe008 [ s] : and i and I [ disfm arker] and I know t hat I can dist inguish at
least t hree t ypes and , probably m ore ,
fe008 [ s] : I m ean , t he [ vocalsound] general [ pause] [ vocalsound]
cult ural idea which w uh , t he conversat ion analyst s originally st art ed
wit h in t he sevent ies was t hat we hav e t his [ vocalsound] st rict m odel
where polit eness involves t hat y ou let t he person finish t h before you
st art t alking ,
fe008 [ s] : and [ pause] and you know , I m ean , [ pause] w we know
t hat [ disfm arker] [ pause] an and t hey ’ve loosened up on t hat t oo s in
t he int ervening t im e , t hat [ pause] t hat t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s
v iewed as being [ pause] a cult urally − relat ive t hing ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : I m ean , [ pause] t hat y ou have t he high − involvem ent
st y le from t he East Coast where people [ vocalsound] will overlap oft en
as an indicat ion of int erest in what t he ot her person is saying .
m e011 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And
fe008 [ s^ fe] : Yeah , exact ly !
fe016 [ s^ fe.%] : Ex act ly !
fe008 [ s] : Well , t here you go .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah
fe008 [ s^ j] : Fine , t hat ’s alright , t hat ’s OK .
fe008 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and , [ pause] you know , in cont rast , so
Deborah [ disfm arker] d and also Deborah Tannen ’s [ pause] t hesis
fe008 [ s] : she t alked about differences of t hese t ypes , [ pause] t hat
t hey ’re just different st yles ,
fe008 [ s] : and it ’s um [ pause] you [ disfm arker] you can’t im pose a
m odel of [ disfm arker] [ pause] t here [ disfm arker] of t he ideal being no
ov erlaps ,
fe008 [ s] : and [ pause] you know , conversat ional analyst s also agree
wit h t hat ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : so it ’s [ pause] now , universally [ pause] a ag agreed
wit h .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And [ disfm arker] and , als
fe008 [ s^ bd] : I m ean , I can’t say univ ersally ,
fe008 [ s] : but any way , t he people who used t o say it was st rict ,
[ pause] um [ pause] now , uh [ pause] don’t .

fe008 [ s] : I m ean t hey [ disfm arker] t hey [ pause] also [ pause]
[ v ocalsound] you know , uh [ pause] uh , ack acknowledge t he
influence of [ pause] sub of subcult ural norm s and [ pause] cross −
cult ural norm s and t hings .
fe008 [ s] : So , um Then it beco [ pause] t hough [ disfm arker] so
[ disfm arker] just [ disfm arker] just superficially t o give [ pause] um
[ pause] a couple ideas of t he t y pes of overlaps involved , I have at t he
bot t om sev eral t hat I not iced .
fe008 [ s] : So , [ pause] [ vocalsound] uh , t here are backchannels , like
what Adam just did now
fe008 [ fh|s] : and , um [ pause] [ v ocalsound] um , ant icipat ing t he end
of a quest ion and [ pause] sim ply answering it earlier ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : and t here are several of t hose in t his [ disfm arker] in
t hese dat a where [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ df^ rt ] : because we ’re [ pause] people who ’ve t alked t o
each ot her ,
fe008 [ s^ df^ e] : um [ pause] we know [ pause] basically what t he t opic
is , what t he possibilit ies are and w and we ’ve spoken wit h each ot her
fe008 [ s] : so we know basically what t he ot her person ’s st yle is likely
t o be
fe008 [ s] : and so [ v ocalsound] and t t here are a num ber of places
where som eone just answered early .
fe008 [ s] : No problem .
fe008 [ s] : And places [ pause] also which I t hought were int erest ing ,
where t wo or m ore people gave ex act ly t h t he sam e answer in unison
[ disfm arker] different words of course
fe008 [ s] : but y ou know , t he [ disfm arker] basically , [ pause] you know
ev ery one ’s saying " yes " or [ disfm arker] you know , or ev even m ore
sp specific t han t hat .
fe008 [ s] : So , uh , t he point is t hat , um [ pause] [ vocalsound] overlap
’s not necessarily a bad t hing and t hat it would be im [ pause] i useful
t o subdivide t hese furt her and see if t here are individual differences in
st y les wit h respect t o t he t ypes inv olv ed .
fe008 [ s] : And t hat ’s all I want ed t o say on t hat , [ pause] unless
people have quest ions .
m e013 [ s] : Well , of course t h t he biggest , [ pause] um [ pause] result
here , which is one we ’ve [ disfm arker] [ pause] we ’ve t alked about
m any t im es and isn’t new t o us , but which I t hink would be int erest ing
t o show som eone who isn’t fam iliar wit h t his [ vocalsound] [ pause] is
just t he sheer num ber of overlaps .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m n005 [ s^ fe] : Yes , yes !
fe008 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : Oh , OK [ disfm arker] int erest ing .
m e013 [ fh] : That [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] Right ? [ pause] t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat , um

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : here ’s a relat ively short m eet ing ,
m e013 [ s] : it ’s a fort y [ disfm arker] [ pause] fort y plus m inut e [ pause]
[ v ocalsound] m eet ing ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : and not only were t here t wo hundred and fift een
ov erlaps [ vocalsound] [ pause] but , [ pause] uh I t hink t here ’s one
[ disfm arker] [ pause] one m inut e t here where t here [ disfm arker] where
[ disfm arker] where t here wasn’t any overlap ?
m e011 [ s^ t 3] : Hundred ninet y − sev en .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : I m ean , it ’s [ disfm arker] [ pause] [ vocalsound] uh
t hroughout t his t hing ?
fe008 [ s] : Well , at t he bot t om , you have t he bot t om t hree .
m e013 [ s.%−] : It ’s [ disfm arker] You have [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ %−] : S n are [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s.%−] : It ’d be int erest ing [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : So four [ disfm arker] four m inut es all t oget her wit h none
[ disfm arker] none .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : Oh , so t he bot t om t hree did have s st uff going on
?
m e018 [ s.%−] : But it w
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes , uh − huh .
m e013 [ s^ bs] : There was speech ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : But just no overlaps .
m e013 [ s.%−] : OK , so if [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t his [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ cs.%−] : It ’d be int erest ing t o see what t he t ot al am ount of
t im e is in t he overlaps , versus [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ aa|s] : Yes , exact ly and t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s where
Jose ’s pro project com es in .
m n017 [ s.%−] : I was about t o ask [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s] : Yeah , y eah , I h I hav e t his t hat infor I have t h t hat
inform at ion now .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fh.%] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : Oh , about how m uch is it ?
m n005 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he durat ion of eh [ disfm arker] of each of
t he ov erlaps .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : O oh , what ’s [ disfm arker] what ’s t he [ disfm arker]
what ’s t he average [ pause] lengt h ?
m n005 [ s^ cc] : M I [ disfm arker] I haven’t averaged it now
m n005 [ s^ cc] : but , uh [ pause] I [ disfm arker] I will , uh I will do t he
[ disfm arker] t he st udy of t he [ disfm arker] [ pause] wit h t he [ disfm arker]
wit h t he program wit h t he [ disfm arker] uh , t he different , uh [ pause]
t he , nnn , [ pause] dist ribut ion of t he durat ion of t he overlaps .

m e013 [ qy ^ d] : You don’t know ?
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : OK , you [ disfm arker] you don you don’t have a
feeling for roughly how [ pause] m uch it is ?
m n005 [ s^ ng] : m m m , [ pause] Because t he [ disfm arker] t he uh , @ @
is @ @ .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s^ na.%−−] : The durat ion is , uh [ pause] t he variat ion
[ disfm arker] t he v ariat ion of t he durat ion is uh , very big on t he dat
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : I suspect t hat it will also differ , [ pause] depending on t he
t y pe of ov erlap [ pause] involved .
m n005 [ %−] : but eh [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : So backchannels will be v ery brief
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Oh , I ’m sure .
m n005 [ s^ na] : Because , on y our surface eh [ pause] a bit of zone of
ov erlapping wit h t he durat ion eh , overlapped and anot her very very
short .
fe008 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s] : Uh , i probably it ’s very difficult t o [ disfm arker] t o
[ disfm arker] because t he [ disfm arker] t he overlap is , uh on is only t he
[ disfm arker] in t he final " S " of t he [ disfm arker] of t he [ disfm arker] t he
fin t he [ disfm arker] t he end [ disfm arker] t he end word of t he , um
[ pause] previous speaker [ vocalsound] wit h t he [ disfm arker] t he next
word of t he [ disfm arker] t he new speaker .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ s] : Um , I considered [ pause] t hat ’s an overlap but it ’s very
short , it ’s an " X " wit h a [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] t he idea is
probably , eh [ pause] when eh [ disfm arker] when eh , we st udied t h t h
t hat zone , eh [ pause] [ pause] eh , we h we have eh eh [ pause]
confusion wit h eh eh noise .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ s] : Wit h eh [ pause] t hat fricat iv e sounds , but uh [ pause] I
have new inform at ion but I have t o [ disfm arker] t o st udy .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , but I [ disfm arker] I ’d [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] u
m n017 [ %−] : Can I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ cs.%] : go ahead .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : You split t his by m inut e , um [ pause] so if an overlap
st raddles [ pause] t he boundary bet ween t wo m inut es , t hat count s
t owards bot h of t hose m inut es .

fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ ar] : Act ually , um [ vocalsound] um [ pause] act ually not .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : Uh , so [ pause] le let ’s t hink about t he case where
[ v ocalsound] A st art s speaking [ pause] [ v ocalsound] and t hen B
ov erlaps wit h A , [ pause] and t hen t he m inut e boundary happens .
fe008 [ s] : And let ’s say t hat [ vocalsound] aft er t hat m inut e boundary
, [ v ocalsound] um [ pause] B is st ill speaking , [ pause] and A overlaps
[ pause] wit h B ,
fe008 [ s] : t hat would be a new overlap .
fe008 [ s] : But ot herwise [ pause] um , let ’s say B [ pause] com es t o
t he conclusion of [ disfm arker] of t hat t urn wit hout [ pause] anyone
ov erlapping wit h him or her ,
fe008 [ s] : in which case t here would be no overlap count ed in t hat
second m inut e .
m n017 [ s] : No , but suppose t hey bot h t alk sim ult aneously
[ v ocalsound] [ pause] bot h a [ disfm arker] a port ion of it is in m inut e
one and anot her port ion of m inut e t wo .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : In t hat case , um [ pause] m y c [ pause] t he coding t hat I
was using [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] since we haven’t , [ pause] uh
[ pause] incorporat ed Adam ’s , uh [ pause] coding of overlap yet s , t he
coding of
fe008 [ s^ t 1] : Yeah , " yet s " is not a word .
fe008 [ s] : Uh [ v ocalsound] since we haven’t incorporat ed Adam ’s
m et hod of handling overl overlaps y et [ vocalsound] um [ pause] t hen
[ pause] t hat would have fallen t hrough t he cra cracks .
fe008 [ s] : It would be an underest im at e of t he num ber of overlaps
because , um [ pause] I wou I wouldn’t be able t o pick it up from t he
way it was [ pause] encoded so far .
fe008 [ s] : We just haven’t done t h t he precise second t o sec you
know , [ pause] second t o second coding of when t hey occur .
m e013 [ %−] : I I
m e013 [ %−−] : I I
m e013 [ s] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m confused now .
m e013 [ s^ cc] : So l l let m e rest at e what I t hought Andreas was say ing
and [ disfm arker] and see .
fe008 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Let ’s say t hat in [ disfm arker] in second fift y − seven
[ pause] [ v ocalsound] of one m inut e , [ pause] you st art t alking and I
st art t alking and [ pause] we ignore each ot her and keep on t alking for
six seconds .
fe008 [ b] : Yep .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ s] : So we go over [ disfm arker] So we were [ disfm arker] we
were t alking over one anot her , [ pause] and it ’s just [ disfm arker] in
each case , it ’s just sort of one [ pause] int erval .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m ?
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e013 [ fh|s] : So , um [ pause] we t alked over t he m inut e boundary .
m e013 [ qy ] : Is t his [ pause] considered as one overlap in each of t he
m inut es , t he way you have done t his .
fe008 [ s^ ar] : No , it wouldn’t .
fe008 [ s^ nd] : It would be considered as an overlap in t he first one .
m e013 [ s] : OK , so t hat ’s [ pause] good , i I t hink , in t he sense t hat I
t hink Andreas m eant t he quest ion ,
fe016 [ s^ aa|s^ na.%−−] : That ’s [ disfm arker] [ pause] t hat ’s good ,
y eah , cuz t he ov erall rat e is [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e011 [ s] : St at ist ical .
fe016 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s] : Ot her − ot herwise you ’d get double count s , here and
t here .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g] : right ?
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : They ’re not double count ed .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : Ah but , y eah .
m n017 [ s] : And t hen it would be harder [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : I should also say I did a sim plifying , uh [ pause] count in
t hat [ v ocalsound] if A was speaking [ pause] B overlapped wit h A and
t hen A cam e back again and overlapped wit h B again ,
fe008 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I didn’t count t hat as a t hree − person ov erlap
, I count ed t hat as a t wo − person overlap , [ pause] and it was A being
ov erlapped wit h by D .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : Because t he idea was t he first speaker [ pause] had t he
floor [ pause] and t he second person [ pause] st art ed speaking and
t hen t he f t he first person reassert ed t he floor [ pause] kind of t hing .
fe008 [ s] : These are sim plifying assum pt ions ,
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : didn’t happen very oft en ,
fe008 [ s] : t here m ay be like t hree overlaps affect ed t hat way in t he
whole t hing .

m e011 [ s^ cc] : I want t o go back and list en t o m inut e fort y − one .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Cuz i i I find it int erest ing t hat t here were a large num ber of
ov erlaps and t hey were all t wo − speaker .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean what I t hought [ disfm arker] what I would have
t hought in [ pause] is t hat when t here were a large num ber of overlaps
, it was because ev eryone was t alking at once , [ vocalsound] but uh
apparent ly not .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s int erest ing .
fe008 [ s^ ba^ r] : That ’s int erest ing .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Mm m .
m e011 [ s] : That ’s really neat .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Yeah , t here ’s a lot of backchannel , a lot o a lot of
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : This is [ pause] really int erest ing dat a .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , it is .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : I t hink so t oo , I t hink [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : I t hink what ’s really int erest ing t hough , it is [ pause] before
d [ pause] say ing " y es , m eet ings hav e a lot of overlaps " is t o act ually
find out how m any m ore [ pause] we have t han t wo − part y .
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : Cuz in t wo − part y conv ersat ions , like Swit chboard , t here
’s an awful lot t oo if y ou just look at backchannels , if you consider
t hose overlaps ?
fe016 [ s] : it ’s also ver it ’s huge .
fe016 [ s] : It ’s just t hat people haven’t been [ pause] looking at t hat
because t hey ’ve been doing single − channel processing for [ pause]
speech recognit ion .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m ?
fe016 [ s] : So , t he quest ion is , you know , how m any m ore overlaps
[ pause] [ v ocalsound] do you have [ pause] of , say t he t wo − person
t y pe , by adding m ore people . t o a m eet ing ,
fe016 [ s] : and it m ay be a lot m ore but i it m ay [ disfm arker] [ pause] it
m ay not be .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Well , but see , I find it int erest ing even if it wasn’t any
m ore ,
fe016 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s^ df] : because [ pause] since we were dealing wit h t his full
duplex sort of t hing in Swit chboard where it was just all separat ed out
[ v ocalsound] we just [ disfm arker] everyt hing was just nice ,
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m ?

m e013 [ s.%−] : so t hat [ disfm arker] so t he issue is in [ disfm arker] in a
sit uat ion [ pause] where t h t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ ar] : Well , it ’s not really [ pause] " nice " .
fe016 [ s] : It depends what you ’re doing .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : So if y ou were act ually [ pause] [ vocalsound] having ,
fe016 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : depends what you ’re doing ,
fe016 [ s] : if [ disfm arker] Right now we ’re do we have individual m ikes
on t he people in t his m eet ing .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m ?
fe016 [ s] : So t he quest ion is , y ou know [ disfm arker] " are t here really
m ore ov erlaps happening t han t here would be in a t wo − person
[ pause] part y " .
m e013 [ s^ cc] : Let [ disfm arker] let m let m e rephrase what I ’m saying
cuz I don’t t hink I ’m get t ing it across .
fe016 [ s.%−] : And [ disfm arker] and t here well m ay be , but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : What [ disfm arker] what I [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker] I
shouldn’t use words like " nice " because m aybe t hat ’s t oo
[ disfm arker] i t oo im precise .
m e013 [ s] : But what I m ean is [ vocalsound] t hat , um in Swit chboard ,
[ pause] despit e t he m any [ disfm arker] m any ot her problem s t hat we
have , one problem t hat we ’re not considering is overlap .
m e013 [ s] : And what we ’re doing now is , [ pause] aside from t he
m any ot her differences in t he t ask , we are considering overlap
m e013 [ s] : and one of t he reasons t hat we ’re considering it , [ pause]
y ou know , one of t hem not all of t hem , one of t hem is [ vocalsound]
t hat w uh at least , [ pause] you know I ’m very int erest ed in
[ v ocalsound] t he scenario in which , uh [ pause] bot h people t alking
are pret t y m uch equally [ pause] audible , [ vocalsound] and from a
single m icrophone .
m e013 [ s] : And so , [ pause] in t hat case , it does get m ixed in ,
[ v ocalsound] and it ’s pret t y hard t o jus [ pause] t o just ignore it , t o
just do processing on one and not on t he ot her .
fe016 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I agree t hat it ’s an issue here [ pause] but it
’s also an issue for Swit chboard
fe016 [ s] : and if y ou [ pause] t hink of m eet ings [ pause] being
recorded over t he t elephone , which I t hink , you know , t his whole
point of st udy ing m eet ings isn’t just t o hav e people in a room but t o
also hav e [ pause] m eet ings ov er different phone lines .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : Maybe far field m ike people wouldn’t be int erest ed in t hat
but all t he dialogue issues st ill apply ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : so if each of us was calling and having [ pause]
[ v ocalsound] a m eet ing t hat way [ pause] y ou kn you know like a
conference call .

fe016 [ s] : And , just t he quest ion is , [ pause] y you know , in
Swit chboard [ pause] you would t hink t hat ’s t he sim plest case of a
m eet ing of m ore t han one person ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : and [ pause] [ vocalsound] I ’m wondering how m uch m ore
[ pause] overlap [ pause] of [ pause] t he t ypes t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
Jane described happen wit h m ore people present .
fe016 [ s] : So it m ay be t hat having t hree people [ pause] [ vocalsound]
is very different from having t wo people or it m ay not be .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : That ’s an im port ant quest ion t o ask .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink what I ’m [ disfm arker] [ pause] All I ’m s really saying
is t hat I don’t t hink we were considering t hat in Swit chboard .
fe016 [ fh] : So .
fe016 [ s^ arp] : Not y ou , m e .
m e013 [ qy .%−] : Were you ?
m e011 [ s] : Though it wasn’t [ pause] in t he design .
fe016 [ fg] : But uh [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] but
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Were you [ disfm arker] were you [ disfm arker] were you
[ disfm arker] were y ou m easuring it ?
m e013 [ s.%−] : I m ean , w w were [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : There [ disfm arker] t here ’s
fe016 [ s^ na.%−−] : act ually t o t ell you t he t rut h , t he reason why it ’s
hard t o m easure is because of
fe016 [ s] : so , from t he point of view of st udying dialogue , I m ean ,
which [ pause] Dan Jurafsky and Andreas and I had som e project s on ,
y ou want t o know t he sequence of t urns .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : So what happens is if you ’re t alking and I have a
backchannel in t he m iddle of your t urn , and t hen you keep going what
it looks like in a dialogue m odel is your t urn and t hen m y backchannel ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : even t hough m y backchannel occurred com plet ely inside
y our t urn .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah ?
fe016 [ s] : So , for t hings like language m odeling or dialogue m odeling
[ pause] [ v ocalsound] it ’s [ disfm arker] We know t hat t hat ’s wrong in
real t im e .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah ?
fe016 [ s] : But , because of t he acoust ic segm ent at ions t hat were
done and t he fact t hat som e of t he acoust ic dat a in Swit chboard were
m issing , people couldn’t st udy it ,
fe016 [ s] : but t hat doesn’t m ean in t he real world t hat people don’t
t alk t hat way .
m e013 [ fg|s^ ng] : Yeah , I wasn’t say ing t hat .
fe016 [ fh|s.%−] : So , it ’s [ disfm arker] um
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?

m e013 [ s] : I was just saying t hat w now we ’re looking at it .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : Well , we ’ve als
m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and , you [ disfm arker]
y ou m ay be want ed t o look at it before but , for t hese various t echnical
reasons in t erm s of how t he dat a was you weren’t .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ na] : We ’re looking at it here .
m e013 [ s] : So t hat ’s why it ’s com ing t o us as new
m e013 [ s.%−−] : ev en t hough it m ay well be [ pause] you know , if your
[ disfm arker] if y our hypot hes The hy pot hesis you were offering
[ v ocalsound] eh [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Um .
m e013 [ s] : Right ? [ disfm arker] if it ’s t he null pot h [ com m ent ]
hypot hesis , and if act ually you have as m uch overlap in a t wo − person
, [ v ocalsound] we don’t know t he answer t o t hat .
m e013 [ s] : The reason we don’t know t he answer t o is cuz it wasn’t
st udied and it wasn’t st udied because it wasn’t set up . Right ?
fe016 [ fg|s^ df] : Yeah , all I m eant is t hat if you ’re asking t he quest ion
from t he point of view of [ pause] what ’s different about a m eet ing ,
st udy ing m eet ings of , say , m ore t han t wo people versus [ pause] what
kinds of quest ions y ou could ask wit h a t wo − person [ pause] m eet ing .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m ?
fe016 [ s] : It ’s im port ant t o dist inguish [ pause] t hat , you know , t his
project [ pause] is get t ing a lot of overlap [ pause] but ot her project s
were t oo , but we just couldn’t st udy t hem .
m e013 [ s^ am ] : May have been .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : And and so uh
m e013 [ s^ am ^ r] : May have been .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s] : We do kn we don’t know t he num bers .
fe016 [ h|s] : Well , t here is a high rat e ,
fe016 [ fh] : So .
fe016 [ s^ no] : It ’s [ disfm arker] but I don’t know how high , in fact
m e018 [ s] : Well , here I have a quest ion .
fe016 [ s] : t hat would be int erest ing t o know .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : See , I m ean , i i le let m e t
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , m y point was just if you want ed t o say t o
som ebody , " what have we learned about overlaps here ? "
m e013 [ s^ co] : just never m ind com parison wit h som et hing else ,
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : what we ’ve learned about is overlaps in t his sit uat ion , is
t hat [ disfm arker] t he first [ disfm arker] [ pause] t he first − order t hing I
would say is t hat t here ’s a lot of t hem .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?

m e013 [ s.%−−] : In [ disfm arker] in t he sense t hat i if you said if
[ disfm arker] i i i
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , I [ disfm arker] I don’t di I agree wit h t hat .
m e013 [ s] : In a way , I guess what I ’m com paring t o is m ore t he
com m on sense not ion of [ vocalsound] how [ disfm arker] how m uch
people ov erlap .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh [ pause] you know t he fact t hat when [ disfm arker]
when [ disfm arker] when , uh , Adam was looking for a st ret ch of
[ disfm arker] of speech before , t hat didn’t have any overlaps , and he
w he was hav ing such a hard t im e
m e013 [ s] : and now I look at t his and I go , " well , I can see why he
was having such a hard t im e " .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s] : That ’s also t rue of Swit chboard .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s happening a lot .
m e013 [ s^ df] : I wasn’t saying it wasn’t .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : It m ay not be [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : So it ’s just , um
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s] : I was com m ent ing about t his .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ df] : I ’m saying if I [ disfm arker] [ pause] I ’m saying if I have
t his com plicat ed t hing in front of m e , [ v ocalsound] and we sh which ,
[ pause] y ou know we ’re gonna get m uch m ore sophist icat ed about
when we get lot s m ore dat a ,
fe016 [ s.%−] : All I ’m saying is t hat from t he
m e013 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] Then , if I was gonna describe t o
som ebody what did you learn [ pause] right here , about , you know ,
t he [ disfm arker] t he m odest am ount of dat a t hat was analyzed I ’d say
, " Well , t he first − order t hing was t here was a lot of overlaps " .
m e013 [ s] : In fact [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] and it ’s not just an
ov erlap [ disfm arker] bunch of ov erlaps [ disfm arker] second − order
t hing is [ vocalsound] it ’s not just a bunch of overlaps in one part icular
point , [ v ocalsound] but t hat t here ’s overlaps , uh t hroughout t he
t hing .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : And t hat ’s int erest ing .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : No , I [ disfm arker] I agree wit h t hat .
m e013 [ s] : That ’s all .
fe016 [ s] : I ’m just [ pause] [ vocalsound] saying t hat it m ay
[ disfm arker] [ pause] t he reason y ou get overlaps m ay or m ay not be
due t o sort of t he num ber of people in t he m eet ing .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Oh yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yeah .

fe016 [ s] : And t hat ’s all .
m e013 [ s^ df] : Yeah , I wasn’t m aking any st at em ent about t hat .
fe016 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and it would act ually be int erest ing t o find
out
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : because som e of t he dat a say Swit chboard , which isn’t
ex act ly t he sam e kind of cont ext ,
fe016 [ s] : I m ean t hese are t wo people who don’t know each ot her
and so fort h ,
fe016 [ s] : But we should st ill be able t o som ehow say what
[ disfm arker] what is t he added cont ra cont ribut ion t o sort of overlap
t im e of each addit ional person , or som et hing like t hat .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e011 [ s] : I could cert ainly see it going eit her way .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah , t hat would be good t o know ,
fe008 [ fg] : OK , now .
m e018 [ %−] : What [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−] : but w we [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Wh − yeah , I [ disfm arker] I agree [ disfm arker] I agree
wit h Adam .
fe016 [ b] : But y eah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : And t he reason is because I t hink t here ’s a lim it
[ disfm arker] [ pause] t here ’s an upper bound [ pause] on how m any
y ou can hav e , sim ply [ pause] from t he st andpoint of audibilit y .
fe008 [ s] : When we speak we [ disfm arker] we do m ake a judgm ent of
[ pause] " can [ disfm arker] " you know , as adult s .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : I m ean , children don’t adjust so well ,
fe008 [ s] : I m ean , if a t ruck goes rolling past , [ vocalsound] adult s will
well , depending , but m ost ly , adult s will [ disfm arker] will [ disfm arker]
[ pause] will hold off t o what [ disfm arker] [ pause] t o finish t he end of
t he sent ence t ill t he [ disfm arker] t ill t he noise is past .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : And I t hink we generally do [ vocalsound] m onit or t hings like
t hat , [ pause] about [ disfm arker] whet her we [ disfm arker] whet her our
ut t erance will be in t he clear or not .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : And part ly it ’s relat ed t o rhyt hm ic st ruct ure in conversat ion
,
fe008 [ s] : so , [ vocalsound] you know , you [ disfm arker] you t Yeah ,
t his is d also um , people t end t o t im e t heir [ disfm arker] t heir
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] t heir , um [ pause] when t hey [ pause] com e
int o t he conversat ion based on t he overall rhyt hm ic , [ pause] uh uh ,
am bient t hing .

m e018 [ fg] : Well [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : So y ou don’t want t o be c cross − cut t ing .
fe008 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and , just t o finish t his , t hat um That I
t hink t hat [ vocalsound] t here m ay be an upper bound on how m any
ov erlaps y ou can hav e , sim ply from t he st andpoint of audibilit y and
how loud t he ot her people are who are already [ pause] in t he fray .
fe008 [ s^ e] : But I [ disfm arker] you know , of cert ain t ypes .
fe008 [ s] : Now if it ’s just backchannels , [ vocalsound] people [ pause]
m ay be doing t hat [ pause] wit h less [ pause] int ent ion of being heard ,
[ pause] just sort of spont aneously doing backchannels ,
fe008 [ s] : in which case [ pause] t hat [ disfm arker] t hose m ight
[ disfm arker] t here m ay be no upper bound on t hose .
m n017 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I have a feeling t hat backchannels , which
are t he vast m ajorit y of overlaps in Swit chboard , [ pause] uh , don’t
play as big a role here , because it ’s very unnat ural I t hink , t o
backchannel if [ disfm arker] in a m ult i − audience [ disfm arker] you know
, in a m ult i − person [ vocalsound] [ pause] audience .
fe016 [ s] : If you can see t hem , act ually .
fe016 [ s] : It ’s int erest ing ,
fe016 [ s] : so if you wat ch people are going like [ disfm arker]
[ com m ent ] [ com m ent ] Right [ disfm arker] right , like t his here ,
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ df] : but That m ay not be t he case if you couldn’t see t hem .
m e013 [ %−] : u
m n017 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] [ pause] but , it ’s sort of odd if one
person ’s speaking and everybody ’s list ening ,
m n017 [ s] : and it ’s unusual t o hav e everybody going " uh − huh , uh −
huh "
m e013 [ s] : Act ually , I t hink I ’ve done it [ pause] a fair num ber of t im es
t oday .
m e013 [ fh] : But .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : There ’s a lot of head − nodding , in t his
m e011 [ b] : Um .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : Yep , we need t o put t rackers on it .
m e018 [ s.%−] : In [ disfm arker] in t he t wo − person [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
fe008 [ s] : He could , he could .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : Plus [ disfm arker] plus [ disfm arker] plus t he
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fg] : Yeah .

m n017 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so act ually , um That ’s in part because
t he nodding , if y ou have visual cont act , [ pause] t he nodding has t he
sam e funct ion ,
m n017 [ s] : but on t he phone , in Swit chboard [ vocalsound] you
[ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker] t hat wouldn’t work .
m e011 [ s^ na] : Yeah , you don’t have it .
m n017 [ s] : So [ vocalsound] so you need t o use t he backchannel .
m e011 [ s^ t 3.%−−] : Your m ike is [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ r^ rt ] : So , in t he t wo − person conversat ions , [ pause]
when t here ’s backchannel , is t here a great deal of [ pause] overlap
[ pause] in t he speech ?
m e011 [ s^ co^ t 3] : That is an earphone , so if you just put it [ pause]
so it ’s on y our ear .
m e018 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : Cuz m y im pression is som et im es it happens when t here ’s
a pause ,
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m e011 [ s^ t 3] : There you go .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ ft ^ t 3] : Thank you .
fe008 [ s] : E for ex am ple .
m e018 [ s] : you know , like you [ disfm arker] you get a lot of
backchannel , when som ebody ’s pausing
fe016 [ b] : Yes .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : She ’s doing t hat .
fe016 [ s^ fa|qw^ rt ] : Sorry , what were y ou saying ?
m e018 [ s] : It ’s hard t o do bot h ,
m e018 [ qy^ d^ g^ j] : huh ?
m e018 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um [ pause] no , when [ disfm arker] when
[ disfm arker] when t here ’s backchannel , I m ean , just [ disfm arker] I
was just list ening , and [ disfm arker] and when t here ’s t wo people
t alking and t here ’s backchannel it seem s like , [ pause] um t he
backchannel happens when , you know , t he pit ch drops and t he first
person [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Oh .
m e018 [ s] : and a lot of t im es , t he first person act ually st ops t alking
and t hen t here ’s a backchannel [ pause] and t hen t hey st art up again
,
m e018 [ s] : and so I ’m wondering about [ disfm arker] h I just wonder
how m uch overlap t here is .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Is t here a lot ?

fe016 [ s^ na] : I t hink t here ’s a lot of t he kind t hat Jose was t alking
about , where [ disfm arker] [ pause] I m ean , t his is called " precision
t im ing " in [ pause] conversat ion analysis , where [ pause] [ vocalsound]
t hey com e in overlapping , [ pause] but at a point where t he [ pause]
inform at ion is m ost ly [ pause] com plet e .
fe016 [ s] : So all you ’re m issing is som e last syllables or som et hing or
t he last word or som e highly predict able words .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : So t echnically , it ’s an overlap .
fe016 [ s] : But [ pause] you know , from inform at ion flow point of view it
’s not an overlap in [ pause] t he predict able inform at ion .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : But m aybe a [ disfm arker] just a sm all overlap ?
m n005 [ b] : More , yeah .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : It ’d be int erest ing if we could do predict ion .
m e018 [ s] : I was just t hinking m ore in t erm s of alignm ent , alignm ent
ov erlap .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Language m odel predict ion of overlap , t hat would be
really int erest ing .
m n017 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker] [ pause] so [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ na] : Well , t hat ’s exact ly , exact ly why we want ed t o st udy
t he precise t im ing of overlaps ins in uh Swit chboard ,
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n017 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so here ’s a [ disfm arker] here ’s a first
int erest ing [ pause] labeling t ask .
fe016 [ s] : say , because t here ’s a lot of t hat .
m n017 [ fh|s] : Uh , t o dist inguish bet ween , say , backchannels
[ v ocalsound] [ pause] precision t im ing [ disfm arker] Sort of
[ v ocalsound] you know , benevolent overlaps , and [ disfm arker] and
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] [ pause] and w and [ disfm arker] and sort of ,
um [ pause] I don’t know , host ile ov erlaps , where [ vocalsound]
som eone is t rying t o grab t he floor from som eone else .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ j^ t 3] : Let ’s pick a different word .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ cs] : Uh , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat m ight be an int erest ing , um
[ pause] problem t o look at .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ j] : Host ile t akeovers .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ng] : Well , I m ean you could do t hat .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .

fe008 [ s^ nd] : I ju I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat [ pause] in t his m eet ing I
really had t he feeling t hat wasn’t happening , t hat [ pause] t he host ile
[ disfm arker] host ile t ype .
fe008 [ s^ nd] : These were [ disfm arker] t hese were [ pause]
benev olent t y pes , as people [ pause] finishing each ot her ’s
sent ences , and [ pause] st uff .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ fg|s^ df^ nd] : Um , I could im agine t hat as [ disfm arker] t here ’s
a fair num ber of [ vocalsound] um cases where , and t his is sort of , not
[ pause] really host ile , but sort of com pet it ive , where [ vocalsound]
one person is finishing som et hing and [ vocalsound] you have , like ,
t wo or t hree people jum ping [ disfm arker] t rying t o [ disfm arker] [ pause]
t ry ing t o [ disfm arker] [ pause] t rying t o , uh grab t he next t urn .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Trying t o get t he floor .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : And so it ’s not against t he person who t alks first [ pause]
because act ually we ’re all wait ing for t hat person t o finish .
m n017 [ s] : But t hey all want t o [ pause] be next .
m e013 [ s^ na] : I have a feeling m ost of t hese t hings are [ disfm arker]
t hat [ disfm arker] [ pause] t hat are not [ pause] a benevolent kind are
[ disfm arker] are [ v ocalsound] [ pause] are , uh [ pause] um [ pause]
[ v ocalsound] are [ disfm arker] are com pet it ive as opposed t o real really
[ disfm arker] really host ile .
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , I agree .
m e013 [ fh] : But .
m e018 [ qw^ d] : I wonder what det erm ines who get s t he floor ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : I agree .
fe008 [ s.%−] : Well , t here are various t hings , you [ disfm arker] you
have t he [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s.%−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s^ j] : Uh a vot e [ disfm arker] vot e in Florida .
m e011 [ s] : It ’s been st udied a lot .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s.%−] : Vot ing for [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s] : Um , o one t hing [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I want ed t o
[ disfm arker] or you can t ell a good joke and t hen everybody ’s laughing
and you get a chance t o g break in .
m n017 [ s] : Seniorit y .
m e013 [ fh] : But .
m e013 [ fh] : But .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .

m e013 [ s] : You know , t he ot her t hing I was t hinking was t hat ,
[ pause] um [ pause] t hese [ disfm arker] all t hese int erest ing quest ions
are , of course , pret t y hard t o answer wit h , uh u [ pause] you know , a
sm all am ount of dat a .
m e011 [ b] : Ach .
m e013 [ s] : So , um [ pause] I wonder if what you ’re saying suggest s
t hat we should m ake a conscious at t em pt t o have , um [ vocalsound] a
[ disfm arker] a fair num ber of m eet ings wit h , uh a sm aller num ber of
people .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e013 [ s] : I m ean [ vocalsound] we [ disfm arker] m ost of our m eet ings
are [ pause] uh , m eet ings current ly wit h say five , six , seven , eight
people
m e013 [ qy ^ cs] : Should we [ pause] really t ry t o have som e t wo −
person m eet ings , [ pause] or som e t hree − person m eet ings and re
record t hem [ v ocalsound] just t o [ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker] t o beef
up t he [ disfm arker] t he st at ist ics on t hat ?
fe008 [ s^ t 3] : That ’s a cont rol .
fe008 [ s] : Well , [ vocalsound] it seem s like t here are t wo possibilit ies
t here ,
fe008 [ s^ ng] : I m ean [ pause] i it seem s like [ vocalsound] if you have
just [ pause] t wo people it ’s not [ pause] really , y like a m eet ing , w is
not as sim ilar as t he rest of t he [ disfm arker] [ pause] of t he sam ple .
fe008 [ s^ arp] : It depends on what you ’re aft er , of course ,
fe008 [ s] : but [ v ocalsound] It seem s like t hat would be m ore a case of
t he cont rol condit ion , com pared t o , uh [ pause] an experim ent al
[ pause] condit ion , wit h m ore t han t wo .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : Well , Liz was raising t he quest ion of [ disfm arker] of
whet her i it ’s t he num ber [ disfm arker] t here ’s a relat ionship bet ween
t he num ber of people and t he num ber of overlaps or t ype of overlaps
t here ,
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s] : and , um [ vocalsound] If you had t wo people m eet ing in
t his kind of circum st ance t hen you ’d st ill have t he visuals .
m e013 [ s] : You wouldn’t have t hat difference [ pause] also t hat you
have in t he [ vocalsound] say , in Swit chboard dat a .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh
fe008 [ s^ nd] : Yeah , I ’m just t hinking t hat ’d be m ore like a c cont rol
condit ion .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : Well , but from t he acoust ic point of view , it ’s all good .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s^ 2^ aa] : Is t he sam e .

m e013 [ s^ na] : Yeah , acoust ic is fine ,
m n017 [ s] : If [ disfm arker] if t he goal were t o just look at overlap you
would [ disfm arker] y ou could serv e yourself [ disfm arker] save yourself
a lot of t im e but not even t ranscri t ranscribe t he words .
m e013 [ %−] : but [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
fe016 [ s] : Well , I was t hinking you should be able t o do t his from t he
[ pause] acoust ics , on t he close − t alking m ikes ,
m e011 [ s^ na] : Well , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t hat was m y
[ disfm arker] m y st at us report ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : You ’ve been working on t hat .
fe016 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
fe016 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : Right , I m ean Adam was [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : so [ v ocalsound] [ pause] Once we ’re done wit h t his st uff
discussing ,
fe016 [ b] : right .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , not as well as what [ disfm arker] I m ean , you
wouldn’t be able t o have any kind of t ypology , obviously ,
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : but you ’d get som e rough st at ist ics .
m e013 [ fg|qo] : But [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker] what do you t hink
about t hat ?
fe016 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ qy ] : Do y ou t hink t hat would be useful ?
m e013 [ s] : I ’m just t hinking t hat as an act ion it em of whet her we
should t ry t o record som e t wo − person m eet ings or som et hing .
fe016 [ s^ co] : I guess m y [ disfm arker] m y first com m ent was , um
[ pause] only t hat [ vocalsound] um we should n not at t ribut e overlaps
only t o m eet ings ,
fe016 [ s] : but m ay be t hat ’s obvious ,
fe016 [ s] : m ay be everybody knew t hat ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : but t hat [ vocalsound] in norm al conversat ion wit h t wo
people t here ’s an awful lot of t he sam e kinds of overlap ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : and t hat it would be int erest ing t o look at [ pause] whet her
t here are t hese kinds of const raint s t hat Jane m ent ioned , t hat
[ v ocalsound] what m aybe t he addit ional people add t o t his
com pet it ion t hat happens right aft er a t urn ,
fe016 [ s^ df] : y ou know , because now you can have five people t rying
t o grab t he t urn ,
fe016 [ s] : but pret t y quickly t here ’re [ disfm arker] t hey back off

fe016 [ s^ e] : and you go back t o t his sort of only one person at a t im e
wit h one person int errupt ing at a t im e .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ fh] : So , I don’t know .
fe016 [ s] : To answer your quest ion I [ pause] it [ disfm arker] I don’t
t hink it ’s crucial t o have cont rols
fe016 [ s] : but I t hink it ’s wort h recording all t he m eet ings we [ pause]
can .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Can .
m e013 [ b] : Well , [ vocalsound] OK .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ fh] : So , um [ pause] you know .
m n017 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I hav e an idea .
fe016 [ s] : D I wouldn’t not record a t wo − person m eet ing just because
it only has t wo people .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n017 [ qy.%−−] : Could we [ disfm arker] Could we , um [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : we have [ disfm arker] have in t he past and I t hink cont inue
[ disfm arker] will cont inue t o hav e a fair num ber of [ pause] uh phone
conference calls .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , we t alked about t his repeat edly .
m n017 [ fh|s^ cs] : And , [ vocalsound] uh , [ pause] and as a
[ disfm arker] t o , um [ vocalsound] as anot her c [ pause] c com parison
[ pause] condit ion , [ pause] we could um see what [ disfm arker] what
what happens in t erm s of overlap , when y ou don’t have visual cont act
.
m n017 [ fh] : So , um [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ qy ^ rt ] : Can we act ually record ?
m e011 [ s^ ng] : It just seem s like t hat ’s a very different [ pause] t hing
t han what we ’re doing .
m e013 [ fh|s^ ng] : Uh Well , we ’ll have t o set up for it .
fe016 [ qy .%−] : I m ean [ pause] physically [ pause] can we record t he o
t he ot her [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ng] : Well , we ’re not really set up for it [ pause] t o do t hat .
m e013 [ fh] : But .
m n017 [ fg|s^ cs] : Or , t his is get t ing a lit t le ext ravagant , we could put
up som e kind of blinds or som et hing t o [ disfm arker] [ pause] t o rem ov e
, uh [ pause] visual cont act .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ fe^ t 3] : Barriers !
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : That ’s what t hey did on Map Task , you know , t his Map
Task corpus ?

fe016 [ s] : They ran exact ly t he sam e pairs of people wit h and wit hout
v isual cues
fe016 [ s] : and it ’s quit e int erest ing .
m e013 [ s] : Well , we [ disfm arker] we record t his m eet ing so regularly it
wouldn’t be t hat [ disfm arker] I m ean [ pause] a lit t le st range .
m e011 [ s^ co^ j] : OK , we can record , but no one can look at each
ot her .
fe016 [ fg|s^ cs^ j] : Well , we could just put [ pause] b blindfolds on .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ co^ j] : Close your eyes .
m n017 [ fg|%−−] : Well y no you [ disfm arker] f
fe008 [ %] : Blindf
m n017 [ b] : Yeah , Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ co^ j] : Turn off t he light s .
fe016 [ s^ j] : and we ’d t ake a pict ure of everybody sit t ing here wit h
blindfolds .
fe016 [ s.%−] : That would [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s] : Oh , t h t hat was t he ot her t hing ,
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : weren’t we gonna t ake a pict ure [ pause] at t he
beginning of each of t hese m eet ings ?
m e011 [ h|s^ nd] : Um , what [ disfm arker] I had t hought we were gonna
do is just t ake pict ures of t he whit eboards . rat her t han t ake pict ures
of t he m eet ing .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well , linguist ic [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fh] : And , uh [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yes .
fe008 [ s^ ng] : Linguist ic ant hropologist s would [ disfm arker] would
suggest it would be useful t o also t ake a pict ure of t he m eet ing .
m e013 [ s] : There ’s a head nodding here vigorously , yeah .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : Why [ disfm arker] why do we want t o have a pict ure of
t he m eet ing ?
fe008 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] because you get t hen t he spat ial
relat ionship of t he speakers .
fe016 [ s.%−] : Ee − [ pause] you m ean , t ransc [ pause] no [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ cs^ ng] : Well , you could do t hat by just not ing on t he
enrollm ent sheet t he [ disfm arker] [ pause] t he seat num ber .
fe008 [ s.%−] : And t hat [ pause] could be
m n005 [ b] : Yeah Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Seat num ber , t hat ’s a good idea .
m e011 [ s^ cc] : I ’ll do t hat .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ cc] : I ’ll do t hat on t he next set of form s .
m n017 [ s] : So y ou ’d num ber t hem som ehow .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .

m n005 [ s] : Is possible t o get inform at ion from t he rhyt hm ic
[ disfm arker] f from t he ge , eh [ pause] uh , files .
m e011 [ s] : I finally rem em bered t o put , uh put nat ive language on t he
newer form s .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : We can [ disfm arker] can’t you figure it out from t he
m ike num ber ?
m e011 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : The wireless ones .
m e011 [ s] : And even t he jacks , I m ean , I ’m sit t ing here and t he jack
is [ pause] over [ pause] in front of you .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
fe016 [ s^ arp] : But probably from t hese you could ’ve [ com m ent ] infer
it .
m n017 [ s^ nd.%−] : Yeah , but It ’s [ disfm arker] it would be t rivial
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ng] : It would be anot her t ask .
fe016 [ s^ df] : It would be a research t ask .
m e011 [ s] : Having [ disfm arker] having ground t u t rut h would be nice ,
so [ pause] seat num ber would be good .
m e018 [ qw^ d^ rt ] : You know where you could get it ?
fe016 [ b] : Yeah , yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : Beam − form ing during t he digit [ pause] uh st uff .
m e011 [ s^ cc] : So I ’m gonna put lit t le labels on all t he chairs wit h t he
seat num ber .
m n014 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : That ’s a good idea .
m n017 [ s^ arp] : Not t he chairs .
fe016 [ s^ co] : But y ou have t o keep t he chairs in t he sam e pla like
here .
m e011 [ fh] : But , uh [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ ng] : The chairs are [ disfm arker] Chairs are m ovable .
m n017 [ s^ cs.%−] : Put t hem [ disfm arker] [ pause] Like , [ pause] put
t hem on t he t able where t hey [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : The chair [ com m ent ] Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : But you know , t hey [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] s t he
linguist ic ant hropologist s would say it would be good t o have a digit al
pict ure anyway ,
m e018 [ s^ t 3] : Just rem em bered a joke .
fe008 [ s^ df] : because you get [ pause] a sense also of post ure .
m n017 [ s^ 2] : What people were wearing .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .

fe008 [ s^ cs] : Post ure , and we could like , [ pause] you know , [ pause]
block out t he person ’s face or what ever
fe016 [ s^ j] : The fashion st at em ent .
fe008 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] but , you know , t hese are
im port ant cues ,
m n017 [ s.%−] : Oh , Andreas was [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ j] : How big t heir heads are .
fe008 [ s.%−] : I m ean t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] how a person is
sit t ing [ pause] is [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But if you just
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : f But from one pict ure , I don’t know t hat you really get
t hat .
m n017 [ s^ j] : Andreas was wearing t hat sam e old sweat er again .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e013 [ s^ cs^ t 3] : You ’d want a video for t hat , I t hink .
fe008 [ s] : It ’d be bet t er t han not hing , is [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] i
Just from a single pict ure I t hink you can t ell som e aspect s .
m n005 [ s^ aa] : A v ideo , yeah .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : Think so ?
fe008 [ s] : I m ean I [ disfm arker] I could t ell you I m ean , if I if I ’m in
cert ain m eet ings I not ice t hat t here are cert ain people who really do
[ disfm arker] eh [ disfm arker] The body language is very uh [ disfm arker]
is very int erest ing in t erm s of t he dom inance aspect .
m n017 [ %] : And [ disfm arker] And [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ j] : And [ disfm arker] and Morgan had t hat funny hair again .
fe008 [ s] : Yeah . [ com m ent ] Well , I m ean you black out t he
[ disfm arker] t hat part .
m e011 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s] : But it ’s just , you know , t he [ disfm arker] t he body
m e018 [ s] : He agreed .
fe008 [ qy ^ d^ g] : you know ?
m e011 [ s] : Of course , t he [ disfm arker] where we sit at t he t able , I
find is v ery int erest ing , t hat we do t end t o [ pause] cong [ pause] t o
grav it at e t o t he sam e place each t im e .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : and it ’s som ewhat coincident al .
m e011 [ s] : I ’m sit t ing here so t hat I can run int o t he room if t he
hardware st art s , you know , cat ching fire or som et hing .
m n017 [ s^ j.%−−] : Oh , no , you [ disfm arker] you just like t o be in
charge , t hat ’s why you ’re sit t ing [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ j] : I just want t o be at t he head of t he t able .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ j] : Take cont rol .

m e013 [ s^ t ^ t c] : Speaking of t aking cont rol , you said you had som e
research t o t alk about .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , I ’ve been play ing wit h , um uh , using t he close −
t alking m ike t o do [ disfm arker] t o t ry t o figure out who ’s speaking .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So m y first at t em pt was just using t hresholding and
filt ering , t hat we t alked about [ disfm arker] about t wo weeks ago ,
m e011 [ s] : and so I played wit h t hat a lit t le bit , and [ vocalsound] it
works O K , [ pause] except t hat [ pause] it ’s very sensit ive t o your
choice of [ vocalsound] your filt er widt h and your [ vocalsound]
t hreshold .
m e011 [ s] : So if you fiddle around wit h it a lit t le bit and you get good
num bers you can act ually do a pret t y good job of segm ent ing when
som eone ’s t alking and when t hey ’re not .
m e011 [ s] : But if y ou t ry t o use t he sam e param ent ers on anot her
speaker , it doesn’t work anym ore ,
m e011 [ s] : even if you norm alize it based on t he absolut e loudness .
fe016 [ qy ^ rt ] : But does it work for t hat one speaker t hroughout t he
whole m eet ing ?
m e011 [ s^ na] : It does work for t he one speaker t hroughout t he whole
m eet ing .
m e011 [ fh|s^ na] : Um Pret t y well .
m e011 [ s^ na^ r] : Pret t y well .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : How did you do it Adam ?
m e011 [ qw^ bu^ rt ] : How did I do it ?
m e011 [ qw^ bu] : What do you m ean ?
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s.%−] : I m ean , wh what was t he [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : The algorit hm was , uh t ake o every fram e t hat ’s over t he
t hreshold , and t hen m edian − filt er it , [ vocalsound] and t hen look for
runs .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : So t here was a m inim um run lengt h ,
m e018 [ qw^ d^ rt ] : Every fram e t hat ’s over what t hreshold ?
m e011 [ %−] : so t hat [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : A t hreshold t hat you pick .
m e018 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : In t erm s of energy ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fh] : Ah !
m e018 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ br] : Say t hat again ?
fe008 [ s] : Fram e ov er fres t hreshold .
m e011 [ s] : So y ou t ake a [ disfm arker] each fram e , and you com put e
t he energy

m e011 [ s] : and if it ’s over t he t hreshold you set it t o one , and if it ’s
under t he t hreshold you set it t o zero , [ v ocalsound] so now you have
a bit st ream [ pause] of zeros and ones .
fe008 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : And t hen I m edian − filt ered t hat [ vocalsound] using , um
[ pause] a fairly long [ pause] filt er lengt h .
m e011 [ fh|s] : Uh [ pause] well , act ually I guess depends on what you
m ean by long , y ou know , t ent h of a second sort s of num bers .
m e011 [ fh|s] : Um and t hat ’s t o av erage out you know , pit ch , you
know , t he pit ch cont ours , and t hings like t hat .
m e011 [ s] : And t hen , uh looked for long runs .
fe008 [ b] : OK
m e011 [ s] : And t hat works O K , if you fil if you t une t he filt er
param et ers , if y ou t une [ vocalsound] how long your m edian filt er is
and how high y ou ’re looking for your t hresholds .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Did you ever t ry running t he filt er before you pick a
t hreshold ?
m e011 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e011 [ s] : I cert ainly could t hough .
m e011 [ s] : But t his was just I had t he program m ost ly writ t en already
so it was easy t o do .
m e011 [ s] : OK and t hen t he ot her t hing I did , was I t ook [ v ocalsound]
Jav ier ’s speaker − change det ect or [ disfm arker] acoust ic − change
det ect or , and I im plem ent ed t hat wit h t he close − t alking m ikes ,
m e011 [ s.%−−] : and [ pause] unfort unat ely t hat ’s not working real well
, and it looks like it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : t he problem is [ disfm arker] he does it in t wo passes ,
m e011 [ s] : t he first pass [ vocalsound] is t o find candidat e places t o
do a break .
m e011 [ s] : And he does t hat using a neural net doing broad phone
classificat ion and he has t he [ vocalsound] t he , uh [ pause] one of t he
phone classes is silence .
m e011 [ s] : And so t he possible breaks are where silence st art s and
ends .
m e011 [ s] : And t hen he has a second pass which is a m odeling
[ disfm arker] a Gaussian m ixt ure m odel .
m e011 [ fh|s] : Um looking for [ vocalsound] uh [ vocalsound] whet her it
im proves or [ disfm arker] or degrades t o split at one of t hose part icular
places .
m e011 [ s] : And what looks like it ’s happening is t hat t he [ disfm arker]
ev en on t he close − t alking m ike t he broad phone class classifier ’s
doing a really bad job .
m e018 [ qw] : Who was it t rained on ?
m e011 [ h|s^ no] : Uh , I have no idea .
m e011 [ s^ no] : I don’t rem em ber .

m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e011 [ qy^ rt ] : Does an do you rem em ber , Morgan ,
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : was it Broadcast News ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : I t hink so , yeah .
m e011 [ fg|s] : Um [ pause] So , at any rat e , m y next at t em pt , [ pause]
which I ’m in t he m idst of and haven’t quit e finished yet was act ually
using t he [ vocalsound] uh , t hresholding as t he way of generat ing t he
candidat es .
m e011 [ s] : Because one of t he t hings t hat definit ely happens is if you
put t he t hreshold low [ vocalsound] you get lot s of breaks .
m e011 [ s] : All of which are definit ely acoust ic event s .
m e011 [ s] : They ’re definit ely [ v ocalsound] som eone t alking .
m e011 [ s] : But , like , it could be som eone who isn’t t he person here ,
but t he person ov er t here or it can be t he person breat hing .
m e011 [ s] : And t hen feeding t hat int o t he acoust ic change det ect or .
m e011 [ s] : And so I t hink t hat m ight work .
m e011 [ s] : But , I haven’t got t en very far on t hat .
m e011 [ s] : But all of t his is close − t alking m ike ,
m e011 [ fh] : so
m e011 [ s] : it ’s , uh [ pause] just [ disfm arker] just t rying t o get som e
ground t rut h .
m n005 [ s.%−−] : Only wit h eh uh ,
m n005 [ s] : but eh I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I t hink , eh when
[ disfm arker] when , y I [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] I saw t he [ disfm arker]
t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he speech from PDA and , eh
[ pause] close [ pause] [ vocalsound] t alker .
m n005 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink t he t here is a [ disfm arker] a great

m e011 [ s^ aa] : Oh , absolut ely .
m e011 [ s] : So [ pause] s m y int ent ion for t his is [ disfm arker] is as an

m n005 [ fg|s] : Um but eh I [ disfm arker] but eh I [ disfm arker] I
[ disfm arker] I m ean t hat eh eh [ pause] in t he [ disfm arker] in t he m ixed

m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Onset det ect or , OK .
m n005 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s probably t o work well eh ,
because , eh [ pause] you have eh , in t he m ixed files a great level of

m n005 [ s] : eh [ pause] and great difference bet ween t he sp speaker .
m n005 [ s] : And probably is not so easy when you use t he [ disfm arker]

m e011 [ b] : Right .
m n005 [ fh|s] : Um [ pause] anot her [ disfm arker] anot her research

m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , when a [ pause] phone changes .
m n005 [ s] : Because , I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s m ore

bet ween t hem , eh [ pause] [ vocalsound] I t hink eh [ pause] is bet t er t o

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fg|s^ ng] : Yeah , t he [ disfm arker] you know , t he reason t hat

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .

[ v ocalsound] as is in your case , if you ’re here for only a m odest

m e011 [ s^ 2] : Do som et hing .

m n005 [ b] : Yeah , yeah , yeah , y eah .
m e013 [ s] : But his [ disfm arker] his goal was always t o proceed from

m n005 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n005 [ fg|qy ] : But , eh [ pause] do [ disfm arker] do you t hink t hat if
y ou consider all t he fram es t o apply [ v ocalsound] t he [ disfm arker] t he ,
eh [ pause] t he BIC crit erion t o det ect t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker]

[ v ocalsound] wit h overlapping ,
m n005 [ fh] : uh ,
m n005 [ s] : I t hink like [ disfm arker] like , eh [ pause] eh a general , eh
[ pause] eh [ pause] way of process t he [ disfm arker] t he acoust ic

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n005 [ s] : An − and t hen , eh [ pause] [ vocalsound] eh [ pause]
wit hout considering t he you [ disfm arker] y ou [ disfm arker] you , um
[ pause] y ou can consider t he energy [ vocalsound] like a anot her

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ s] : This [ disfm arker] t his is t he idea .

y ou [ disfm arker] you will need t t I [ disfm arker] I suppose t hat you will

m e011 [ s^ aa] : Oh , absolut ely .
m e013 [ fg|s.%−] : Well , I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ na] : This is [ disfm arker] t his is not what I was suggest ing t o
do .
m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : u [ vocalsound] Look , I [ disfm arker] I t hink t his is a
[ disfm arker]
m n005 [ qy^ bh] : Really ?
m e013 [ s] : One [ disfm arker] once [ disfm arker] It ’s a [ disfm arker] I
used t o work , like , on voiced [ disfm arker] on voice silence det ect ion ,
y ou know , and t his is t his [ pause] kind of t hing .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s] : Um [ pause] If you [ vocalsound] have som ebody who has
som e experience wit h t his sort of t hing , and t hey work on it for a
couple m ont hs , [ v ocalsound] t hey can com e up wit h som et hing t hat
get s m ost of t he cases fairly easily .
m e013 [ s] : Then y ou say , " OK , I don’t just wanna get m ost of t he
cases I want it t o be really accurat e . "
m e013 [ s] : Then it get s really hard no m at t er what you do .
m e013 [ s] : So , t he p t he problem is is t hat if you say , " Well I
[ disfm arker] I have t hese ot her dat a ov er here , [ vocalsound] t hat I
learn t hings from , eit her explicit t raining of neural net s or of Gaussian
m ix t ure m odels or what ever . "
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh [ pause] Suppose you don’t use any of t hose t hings .
m e013 [ s] : You say y ou have looked for acoust ic change .
m e013 [ qw] : Well , what does t hat m ean ?
m e013 [ s] : That [ disfm arker] t hat m eans you set som e t hresholds
som ewhere or som et hing ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qw] : and [ disfm arker] and so [ vocalsound] where do you get
y our t hresholds from ?
m e013 [ s] : From som et hing t hat y ou looked at .
m e013 [ fh|s] : So [ vocalsound] you always have t his problem , you ’re
going t o new dat a
m e013 [ fh|qw] : um [ pause] H how are you going t o adapt what ever
y ou can v ery quickly learn about t he new dat a ? [ vocalsound] Uh , if it
’s gonna be different from old dat a t hat y ou have ?
m e013 [ s] : And I t hink t hat ’s a problem [ pause] wit h t his .
m e011 [ fg|s] : Well , also what I ’m doing right now is not int ended t o
be an acoust ic change det ect or for far − field m ikes .
m e011 [ s] : What I ’m doing [ vocalsound] is t rying t o use t he close −
t alking m ike [ v ocalsound] and just use [ disfm arker] [ pause] Can − and
just generat e candidat e and just [ pause] t ry t o get a first pass at
som et hing t hat sort of works .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah !
m n017 [ fg] : Act ually [ disfm arker] act ually [ disfm arker] act ually
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ 2] : You have candidat es .
m n005 [ s^ 2] : t he candidat e .
m n017 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ 2] : t o m ake m arking easier .
m n017 [ %−−] : Or [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : and I haven’t spent a lot of t im e on it and I ’m not
int ending t o spend a lot of t im e on it .

m n017 [ b] : OK .
m n017 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] um , I , unfort unat ely , have t o run ,
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m n017 [ s] : but , um [ pause] I can im agine [ pause] uh building [ pause]
a [ pause] um [ pause] m odel of speaker change [ pause] det ect ion
[ pause] t hat [ v ocalsound] t akes int o account [ pause] bot h t he far −
field and t he [ vocalsound] uh [ pause] act ually , not just t he close −
t alking m ike for t hat speaker , but act ually for all of t h [ pause] for all of
t he speakers .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Ev ery one else .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ fh|s.%−−] : um [ pause] If y ou m odel t he [ disfm arker] [ pause]
t he [ pause] effect t hat [ pause] m e speaking has on [ pause] your
[ pause] m icrophone and every body else ’s m icrophone , as well as on
t hat , [ v ocalsound] and you build , um [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : basically I t hink you ’d [ disfm arker] you would [ pause] build
a [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] an HMM t hat has as a st at e space all of
t he possible speaker com binat ions
m e011 [ s^ 2|s^ aa] : All t he [ disfm arker] Yep .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ fh|s.%−] : and , um [ vocalsound] you can cont rol [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : It ’s a lit t le big .
m n017 [ s^ nd] : It ’s not t hat big act ually ,
m n017 [ fh] : um
m e011 [ s^ df^ nd] : Two t o t he N .
m e011 [ s^ df^ nd] : Two t o t he num ber of people in t he m eet ing .
m e013 [ fg|s^ cs] : But [ disfm arker] Act ually , Andreas m ay m aybe
[ disfm arker] m ay be just som et hing sim pler but [ disfm arker] but along
t he lines of what y ou ’re saying ,
m e011 [ fh] : Anyway .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I was just realizing , I used t o know t his guy who used t o
build , uh [ vocalsound] um , m ike m ixers [ disfm arker] aut om at ic m ike
m ix ers where , you know , t in order t o able t o t urn up t he gain , you
know , uh [ vocalsound] as m uch as you can , you [ disfm arker] you
[ disfm arker] you lower t he gain on [ disfm arker] on t he m ikes of people
who aren’t t alking ,
m n017 [ b] : Mm m .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah [ com m ent ] Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Mm m .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen he had som e sort of [ vocalsound] reasonable
way of doing t hat ,

m e013 [ qw^ cs] : but [ vocalsound] uh , what if you were just looking at
v ery sim ple m easures like energy m easures but you don’t just com pare
it t o som e t hreshold [ pause] overall but y ou com pare it t o t he
[ v ocalsound] energy in t he ot her m icrophones .
m e011 [ s^ na] : I was t hinking about doing t hat originally t o find out
[ pause] who ’s t he loudest ,
m e011 [ s^ e^ rt ] : and t hat person is cert ainly t alking .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : But I also want ed t o find t hreshold [ disfm arker] uh ,
ex cuse m e , m ol overlap .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So , not just [ disfm arker] just t he loudest .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ fh] : But , eh
m n005 [ s^ fa] : I [ disfm arker] I Sorry .
m n005 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I hav e found t hat when [ disfm arker] when I I
analy zed t he [ disfm arker] t he speech files from t he , [ pause] eh
[ pause] m ike , eh [ pause] from t he eh close eh [ pause] m icrophone ,
eh [ pause] I found zones wit h a [ disfm arker] a different level of energy
.
m n017 [ s] : Sorry , I have t o go .
m e011 [ s^ bk^ t 3] : OK .
m e011 [ qy^ cs^ t 3] : Could you fill t hat out anyway ?
m e011 [ s^ co^ t 3] : Just , [ pause] put y our nam e in .
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ rt ^ t 3] : Are y you want m e t o do it ?
m e011 [ s^ cc^ t 3] : I ’ll do it .
m e018 [ s^ ng^ t 3] : But he ’s not gonna even read t hat .
m e011 [ s^ na^ t 3] : I know .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n005 [ s] : including overlap zone .
m n005 [ s^ bsc] : including .
m n005 [ s] : because , eh [ pause] eh [ pause] depend on t he posit ion
of t he [ disfm arker] of t he m icroph of t he each speaker [ vocalsound] t o
, eh , t o get m ore o or less energy [ v ocalsound] i in t he m ixed sign in
t he signal .
m n005 [ s] : and t hen , [ vocalsound] if you consider energy t o
[ disfm arker] t o det ect overlapping in [ disfm arker] in , uh , and you
process t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he speech file from t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t he m ixed signals .
m n005 [ s^ bsc] : The m ixed signals , eh .
m n005 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s difficult , um
[ v ocalsound] [ pause] only t o en wit h energy t o [ disfm arker] t o
consider t hat in t hat zone We have eh , eh , overlapping zone Eh , if
y ou process only t he t he energy of t he , of each fram e .
m e013 [ s^ aap] : Well , it ’s probably harder ,

m e013 [ s] : but I [ disfm arker] I t hink what I was s nnn not ing just when
he [ disfm arker] when Andreas raised t hat , was t hat t here ’s ot her
inform at ion t o be gained from looking at all [ vocalsound] of t he
m icrophones and y ou m ay not need t o look at very sophist icat ed
t hings ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : because if t here ’s [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] if m ost of t he
ov erlaps [ disfm arker] you know , t his doesn’t cover , say , t hree , but if
m ost of t he overlaps , say , are t wo , [ vocalsound] if t he dist ribut ion
looks like t here ’s a couple high ones and [ disfm arker] and [ pause]
t he rest of t hem are low ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : And everyone else is low , yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ rt ] : you know , what I m ean ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : t here ’s som e inform at ion t here about t heir dist ribut ion
ev en wit h very sim ple m easures .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs^ j] : Uh , by t he way , I had an idea wit h [ disfm arker] while
I was wat ching Chuck nodding at a lot of t hese t hings , is t hat we can
all wear lit t le bells on our heads , [ vocalsound] so t hat [ vocalsound]
t hen you ’d know t hat [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ j] : Ding , ding , ding , ding .
fe008 [ s^ j] : " Ding " .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s cut e !
fe016 [ s^ cs^ na] : I t hink t hat ’d be really int erest ing t oo , wit h
blindfolds .
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : Nodding wit h blindfolds ,
fe016 [ %−−] : Then [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ qw^ j] : " what are you nodding about ? "
fe016 [ s.%−−] : The quest ion is , [ pause] like [ pause] whet her
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ cs] : Well , t rying wit h and [ disfm arker] [ pause] wit h and
wit hout , yeah .
m e011 [ s^ fa^ j] : " Sorry , I ’m just [ disfm arker] I ’m just going t o sleep .
"
fe016 [ s] : But t hen t here ’s just one @ @ , like .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .

m e018 [ s] : Act ually , I saw a uh [ disfm arker] a wom an at t he bus st op
t he ot her day who , um , was t alking on her cell phone [ vocalsound]
speaking Japanese , and was bowing .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah [ com m ent ] Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ e] : y ou know , profusely .
fe016 [ s] : Oh , y eah , t hat ’s really com m on .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Ah .
m e018 [ s.%−] : Just , kept [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Wow .
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : It ’s very difficult if you t ry [ disfm arker] while you ’re t rying
, say , t o conv ince som ebody on t he phone it ’s difficult not t o m ove
y our hands .
fe016 [ s] : Not [ disfm arker] You know , if you wat ch people t hey ’ll
act ually do t hese t hings .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m ?
fe016 [ fh] : So .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : I st ill t hink we should t ry a [ disfm arker] a m eet ing or t wo
wit h t he blindfolds ,
fe016 [ s] : at least of t his m eet ing t hat we hav e lot s of recordings of
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ aa.%−] : Yeah , I t hink t h
fe016 [ s^ cs] : Um , m aybe for part of t he m eet ing , we don’t have t o
do it t he whole m eet ing .
m e013 [ s^ ba^ na] : I t hink it ’s a great idea .
fe016 [ s] : That could be fun .
fe016 [ s] : It ’ll be t oo hard t o m ake barriers , I was t hinking because
t hey have t o go all t he way
m e013 [ b] : W Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : y ou know , I can see Chuck even if you put a barrier here
.
m e011 [ fg|s^ cs] : Well , we could just t urn out t he light s .
fe008 [ fg|s^ rt ] : Act ually [ pause] well also [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I
can say I m ade barr barriers for [ disfm arker] so t hat [ disfm arker] t he
[ pause] st uff I was doing wit h Collin wha [ pause] which [ pause] just
used , um [ pause] t his [ pause] kind of foam board .
fe016 [ qy ^ bh^ d^ rt ] : Y Yeah ?
fe008 [ s^ e] : R really inexpensive .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : You can [ disfm arker] you can m asking t ape it t oget her ,
fe008 [ s] : t hese are [ pause] you know , pret t y l large part it ions .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : But t hen we also hav e t hese m ikes , is t he ot her t hing I
was t hinking ,
fe016 [ s^ cs] : so we need a barrier t hat doesn’t dist urb [ pause] t he
sound ,

m e011 [ s^ 2] : The acoust ics .
fe008 [ s^ na] : It ’s t rue , it would dist urb t he , um [ pause] t he
[ disfm arker] t he long − range [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fh] : um
m e013 [ s^ cs^ na] : Blindfolds would be good .
m e011 [ s^ cs^ na] : I t hink , blindfolds .
fe008 [ %] : it would [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , it sounds weird but [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker]
[ pause] y ou know it ’s [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] it ’s cheap and , uh Be
int erest ing t o have t he cam era going .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Probably we should wait unt il aft er Adam ’s set up t he
m ikes ,
m e013 [ fh] : But .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : I t hink we ’re going t o have t o work on t he , uh
[ disfm arker] [ pause] on t he hum an subject s [ vocalsound] form .
m e018 [ s^ j] : I ’ll be peeking .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , t hat ’s right , we didn’t t ell t hem we would be
blindfolding .
m e013 [ s.%−] : That ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ qy ^ j] : " Do you m ind being blindfolded while you ’re int erviewed
?"
m e013 [ s^ co^ j] : t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he
one t hat we videot ape .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fh|s^ co^ t c] : Um , I [ disfm arker] I wanna m ove t his along .
m e013 [ fh|s^ t ] : Uh [ pause] I did have t his ot her agenda it em which is
, uh @ @ [ disfm arker] it ’s uh a list which I sent t o uh [ disfm arker] a
couple folks , but um I want ed t o get broader input on it ,
m e013 [ s] : So t his is t he t hings t hat I t hink we did [ vocalsound] in t he
last t hree m ont hs
m e013 [ s^ e] : obviously not everyt hing we did but [ disfm arker] but
sort of highlight s t hat I can [ disfm arker] [ pause] can [ pause] t ell
[ pause] s som e out side person , you know , what [ disfm arker] what
were y ou [ pause] act ually working on .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um [ pause] in no part icular order [ vocalsound] uh , one
, uh , t en m ore hours of m eet ing r m eet ings recorded , som et hing like
t hat , you know from [ disfm arker] from , uh [ pause] t hree m ont hs ago .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh [ pause] XML form at s and ot her t ranscript ion aspect s
sort ed out [ pause] and uh [ pause] sent t o IBM .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , pilot dat a put t oget her and sent t o IBM for
t ranscript ion ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh [ pause] next bat ch of recorded dat a put t oget her on
t he CD − ROMs for shipm ent t o IBM ,
m e011 [ s] : Hasn’t been sent yet , but [ disfm arker] It ’s get t ing ready .
m e013 [ s^ df] : But yeah , t hat ’s why I phrased it t hat way , yeah OK .

m e013 [ fh|s] : Um [ pause] hum an subject s approval on cam pus , uh
[ pause] and release form s worked out
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : so t he m eet ing part icipant s have a chance t o request
audio pix elizat ion of select ed part s of t he spee t heir speech .
m e013 [ fh|s^ rt ] : Um [ vocalsound] audio pixelizat ion soft ware writ t en
and t est ed .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um [ pause] [ vocalsound] prelim inary analysis of
ov erlaps in t he pilot dat a we hav e t ranscribed ,
m e013 [ s] : and ex plorat ory analysis of long − dist ance inferences for
t opic coherence , t hat was [ disfm arker] I was [ disfm arker] [ pause]
wasn’t [ pause] sure if t hose were t he right way [ disfm arker] [ pause]
t hat was t he right way t o describe t hat because of t hat lit t le exercise
t hat [ disfm arker] t hat you [ com m ent ] and [ disfm arker] and Lokendra
did .
fe008 [ qw^ bu] : What was t hat called ?
fe008 [ s^ br] : The , uh [ pause] say again ?
m e013 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] well , I I ’m probably saying t his wrong , but
what I said was explorat ory analysis of long − dist ance inferences
[ v ocalsound] for t opic coherence .
m e013 [ s] : Som et hing like t hat .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um [ pause] so , uh [ pause] I [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
[ pause] a lot of t hat was from , you know , what [ disfm arker] what
[ disfm arker] what you t wo were doing
m e013 [ s] : so I [ disfm arker] I sent it t o you ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and you know , please m ail m e , you know , t he
correct ions or suggest ions for changing
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t want t o m ake t his t wice it ’s lengt h
but [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] but you know , just im im prove it .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−] : Um Is t here anyt hing anybody [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I did a bunch of st uff for support ing of digit s .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m .%−] : " Bunch of st uff for s "
m e013 [ s^ co] : OK , m aybe [ disfm arker] m aybe send m e a sent ence
t hat ’s a lit t le t hought t hrough about t hat .
m e011 [ qy^ bu^ cc^ d^ rt ] : So , [ pause] OK , I ’ll send you a sent ence
t hat doesn’t just say " a bunch of " ?
m e013 [ s^ nd] : " Bunch of st uff " , yeah , " st uff " is probably bad t oo ,
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e011 [ s^ na] : " St uff " [ pause] is not v ery t echnical .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , well .
m e011 [ s^ cc] : I ’ll t ry t o [ pause] phrase it in passive voice .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .

m e018 [ s] : Technical st uff .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : " range of t hings " , yeah .

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ qy.%−] : So [ disfm arker] what is [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker]
Um .
m e013 [ %−] : That ’s [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ ar] : Not really .
m e018 [ s] : It ’s t oo com plicat ed .
m n014 [ fh|s^ no] : Um , [ pause] I didn’t get it .
m n014 [ qw] : Wh − what is " audio pixelizat ion " ?
m e013 [ h|s] : Uh , audio pix wh he did it ,
m e013 [ qw^ co] : so why don’t you ex plain it quickly ?
m e011 [ s] : It ’s just , uh [ pause] beeping out part s t hat you don’t
want included in t he m eet ing
m e011 [ s] : so , you know you can say t hings like , " Well , t his should
probably not be on t he record , but beep "
m n014 [ b] : OK , OK .
m n014 [ s^ bk] : I got t hat .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : We [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] we spent a [ disfm arker] a
[ disfm arker] a fair am ount of t im e early on just t alk dealing wit h t his
issue about op w e e [ vocalsound] we realized , " well , people are
speaking in an im prom pt u way and t hey m ight say som et hing t hat
would em barrass t hem or ot hers lat er " , and , how do you get around
t hat
m n014 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n014 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : so in t he consent form it says , well you [ disfm arker] we will
look at t he t ranscript s lat er and if t here ’s som et hing t hat you ’re
[ pause] unhappy wit h , yeah .
m n014 [ s.%−−] : OK , and you can say [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : But you don’t want t o just t ot ally excise it
m e013 [ %−−] : because
m e013 [ fh] : um
m e013 [ s] : uh , well you have t o be careful about excising it , how
[ disfm arker] how y ou excise it
m e013 [ s^ e] : keeping t he t im ing right and so fort h
m e013 [ s^ e] : so t hat at t he m om ent t ho t h t he idea we ’re running
wit h is [ disfm arker] is h put t ing t he beep over it .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , y ou can eit her beep or it can be silence .

m n014 [ fh] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I couldn’t decide . which was t he right
way t o do it .
m n005 [ b] : Ah , y eah .
m e011 [ s] : Beep is good audit orily ,
m e011 [ s] : if som eone is list ening t o it , t here ’s no m ist ake t hat it ’s
been beeped out ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : but for soft ware it ’s probably bet t er for it t o be silence
.
m e018 [ s^ ar] : No , no .
m e018 [ s^ nd] : You can [ disfm arker] you know , you could m ake a m
as long as y ou keep using t he sam e beep , people could m ake a
m odel of t hat beep ,
fe008 [ b] : Hm m .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m e018 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : I like t hat idea .
m e011 [ s] : And I use [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s , uh [ pause] it
’s an A below m iddle C beep ,
fe016 [ s^ ba] : I t hink t he beep is a really good idea .
fe008 [ s] : It ’s very clear .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : Then y ou don’t t hink it ’s a long pause .
fe016 [ %−] : Also [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fh] : so

m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yea − right .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e011 [ s.%−] : Yeah , it ’s not [ disfm arker]

please do send m e , you know , uh t hought s for an agenda ,
m e011 [ qy ^ 2^ d^ rt ] : Agenda ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : yeah
