m eant im e ,
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : because I get , I would like t o say , different signals
from Siem ens ,
m n082 [ s] : I believ e , in t he m eant im e it ’s a higher probabilit y t hat I
will ret urn ,
m n082 [ s^ df^ rt ] : but based on t he pro uh , procedure t o get a J − one
v isa and t he IP six six it will be [ disfm arker] I would like t o say , earliest
st age will be end of January ,

pot ent ial successor as a group leader can hook in wit h t hese t hings
and t hat t hese web pages will be updat ed every t im e when it is

m n082 [ s^ df] : We t ried t o do it , so t hat it m ust be at least updat ed
only when really m ajor changes happen .
m n082 [ s^ e] : So t hat m eans som ebody ’s leaving t he group ,
m n082 [ s^ e] : uh , som ebody is joining t he group ,
m n082 [ s^ e] : a new project is st art ed ,
m n082 [ fh|s^ cs] : but , uh , t he effort should be m inim ized as possible

m n082 [ s^ cs] : m aybe a few lines ,
m n082 [ s^ cs] : m ay be a pict ure .
m n082 [ s^ co] : And som et hing like t hat should be added t o USAIA ?
m n082 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , t hat ’s m y st uff .
m n082 [ fh] : And
m n082 [ fh] : um
m n082 [ s^ rt ^ t c] : t hen t he next point is t hen t his act ive rout ing st uff ?
m n082 [ fh] : Um
m n082 [ s] : I would like t o discuss it before ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : but you were busy .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n082 [ fh] : And so [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ fh] : um ,
m n082 [ s^ cs] : I believe , it m ust be adjust ed t o t he current act ivit ies
a lit t le bit m ore .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ fh] : And , um
m n082 [ s.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink it doesn’t [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : It is not wort h t o discuss it now
m n082 [ s^ df] : because nobody raised it before .
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n021 [ s^ na] : I t hink so .
m n082 [ fh|s^ co] : And , uh , so l let us have a bilat eral discussion
aft erwards .
m n082 [ s^ cs] : I would [ disfm arker] what I would like t o have is t hat um
, your cont ribut ions is relat ed t o cert ain kind of t hings happened here
.
m n082 [ s] : And t hat m eans really t o t he project proposal it self and
also m ay be t o t he USAIA archit ect ure ,
m n082 [ s] : in t hat sense , t hat at cert ain st ages , cuz it ’s a general
archit ect ure , cert ain st ages m ay be t o fut ure [ vocalsound] m obile core
net works , t hat it is relat ed t o t hese kind of t hings .
m n082 [ fh|s^ co] : Um , having [ disfm arker] uh , I [ disfm arker] what I
have in m ind is t hat t hings should not be st art ed from t he end syst em
.
m n082 [ s] : That ’s m y principle concern ,
m n082 [ s] : because t hat will nev er be happen , from m y point of view .
m n082 [ s^ co] : It should be st art ed as t he edge device ,
m n082 [ s] : so t hat it cu cert ain kind of m echanism , what ev er , is
enabled bet ween t he ingress edge device and t he out gress a edge
device ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : because it will be at t he cert ain st age IP based in t he
fut ure generat ion t elecom m unicat ion net works before it s goal .

m n021 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s^ aa] : That ’s OK .
m n082 [ s] : Fuel it t o t he [ disfm arker] over t he int ernet ,
m n082 [ s] : and b bet ween t hese bot h boxes , I can assum e uh
because t he m obilit y happens t here as a norm al nat ural t hing
m n082 [ s] : and t he forwarding process and t he rout ing process
should be no m ore separat ed , from m y point of view .
m n082 [ s] : And t o have t here a cert ain kind of int elligent m echanism ,
t hat t he packet s can be used t o set up t he rout es because t hey have
all t he inform at ion .
m n082 [ s] : They know where t hey have t o go because IP addresses
are st ill t here and [ disfm arker] wit hin t he packet .
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ qw] : I m ean , how can t his use , uh , wit hin t his area , and how
t his area is t hen aligned t o t he m ore t radit ional rout ing wit hin t he
int ernet backbone it self .
m n082 [ s] : That ’s m y quest ion .
m n082 [ s^ ba] : And I t hink t hat is good a research area ,
m n082 [ s.%−−] : t hen I t hink t here ’s a lot of [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ df] : I ’m not a e xpert at all for t his .
m n082 [ s^ ba] : But I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I believe , t here ’s a lot
of pot ent ial for t hat .
m n082 [ s^ cs] : And we should discuss it m aybe bilat eral aft erwards .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Yeah ?
m n082 [ s^ bs^ co] : So , one m ore t im e , everybody should t ake a look
t o t he web pages
m n082 [ s^ bs^ co] : and from Claudia , at t he general rem arks
m n082 [ s^ bs^ co] : and should writ e based on t he , uh , headlines in
t he project proposal t he um t hings what st ill happened , t he t hings
what t hey hav e st ill in m ind
m n082 [ fh|s^ df] : uh [ pause] so t hat we can updat e t hese last @ @
y ou know @ @ present t he last m ajor part of t he web pages .
m n030 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : The pages are already on t he web ?

m n030 [ b] : OK .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : Hm m .
m n082 [ fh] : and

m n082 [ fh] : so .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fn083 [ s^ r] : Yeah , so t here are som e gaps left
fn083 [ fh] : and ,
fn083 [ fh] : I don’t know ,
fn083 [ s^ cs] : you [ disfm arker] Maybe y ou can also read t hrough t he
[ disfm arker] all t he t ext which is on t he web pages
fn083 [ s^ df] : cuz I ’d like t o change t he t ext a bit
fn083 [ s^ df] : cuz som et im es it ’s t oo long ,
fn083 [ s^ df] : som et im es it ’s t oo short ,
fn083 [ s^ df] : m ay be t he English is not t hat good ,

m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s^ df] : But , [ vocalsound] uh , it is not a research work .
m n021 [ s^ df] : Usually it ’s an applicat ion work .
m n021 [ s] : So y ou build a web sit e , your own E − com m erce sit e , uh ,
[ v ocalsound] what ever ,
m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s.%−−] : or a program or [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ qw^ j^ rt ] : Why I didn’t st udy in Spain ?
m n021 [ %−] : but [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ df] : But it is not , uh , som et hing your t eacher prov ides you

m n082 [ %−] : and so ?
m n021 [ fg] : So
m n021 [ s^ t c] : we have , uh , ot her st udent s are which are , uh , m m m

m n021 [ s] : and t hey are [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t hey are st art ing
as , uh , researchers ,
m n021 [ fh|s] : aaa , [ com m ent ] but t his is only connect ed [ vocalsound]
t o your own funding
m n021 [ s] : so if y ou [ disfm arker] if you have project s [ vocalsound] you

m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s] : If you don’t have , [ vocalsound] a research project
[ v ocalsound] well , you cannot pay t hem
m n021 [ s] : so u u usually [ vocalsound] you don’t have anybody .
m n021 [ s] : So it ’s kind of , uh , [ vocalsound] dependent on t he
funding we have in som e project s .
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ %] : w
m n021 [ s] : it ’s not sure ,
m n082 [ s^ ar^ t 3] : Hm m ? No ,
m n021 [ s] : not really sure .
m n082 [ s^ t 3] : t here .
m n082 [ s] : We ’re not t alking about t o send t he st udent s here t o I C
m n082 [ s^ df.%−] : S I . I ’m t alking if t here is an act ivit y , at least wit h
t he NSA group , t hat cert ain kind of act iv it ies also in t he universit y
could apply for t he m ast er works , of diplom as t hesis , [ pause] uh ,
what ev er kind of t hing t hat [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n021 [ %−] : we [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s] : I t hink we could [ disfm arker] We could find , uh , som e , eh
work force .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s.%−−] : Because [ disfm arker] well , you [ disfm arker] you can ,
eh , fo [ v ocalsound] redirect you know , t he [ disfm arker] t he work as
[ disfm arker] uh let ’s say as a subject work of som et hing [ vocalsound]
t hat y ou can [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] you can t ry t o , eh , s
m n021 [ s] : In som e subject s , in fact , [ vocalsound] eh , t he
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he , uh , t opics are m ore open
m n021 [ s] : so [ v ocalsound] you can int roduce som e research t opics
t oo .
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ s] : but t he m ain t hing is t hat t here is a , uh , t his big
difference
m n021 [ s^ df] : because , eh , st udent s are not supposed t o do

m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n081 [ s] : You can change t hat .
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n021 [ s^ aa] : sure .
m n081 [ s.%−−] : M uh , m aybe you sh
m n021 [ s^ aa^ r] : Sure .
m n081 [ s] : I t hink it ’s pret t y healt hy for a st udent t o [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] t o hav e a project , eh , where you have t o writ e act ually
som e part of research
m n081 [ fh] : or .
m n021 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , I t hink so t oo ,
m n021 [ s] : but , eh , you know , it also depends on t he subject s
m n021 [ s^ df] : because som et im es subject s are fixed
m n081 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m n021 [ s^ df] : so y ou cannot [ disfm arker] you cannot , uh uh , give
any [ disfm arker] any st uff you want .
m n081 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s^ df] : You have t o [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t o provide a

m n081 [ %] : O
m n081 [ s^ aa] : Of course .
m n021 [ s] : but , y ou know , som et im es , especially in t he [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] in t he lat est , eh uh , courses uh , t hings are probably

m n021 [ s] : and , well , it [ disfm arker] it is som et hing t hat can be

m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ b] : OK .
m n082 [ s^ ft .%] : Thank you .
m n082 [ qy ^ rt ] : Claudia , I st ill m ent ioned , Have you ot her t hings ?
m n082 [ s] : For m e , as I said before I will be funded by a d uh by t he
m inist ry of , uh , t he Germ an gov ernm ent for research in t he project so

m n082 [ s] : That seem s t o be sure .
m n082 [ s] : And I got absolut ely freedom t o do what I would like t o do ,
m n082 [ s] : and I would like t o go on wit h t he QS in advance
m echanism
m n082 [ fh] : and , uh ,
m n082 [ s] : in t he relat ion of USAIA I also hav e t he [ vocalsound]
act ivit ies wit h Georgia Tech .
m n082 [ s] : They have now a PHD .
m n082 [ s] : It is set t led ,
m n082 [ s] : and m y ot her next , uh , generat ion of cont ract is also

m n082 [ s] : and when I will com e back here , I would like t o use t hese

um , out side of t his goal , wit h cont ribut ions here from , uh [ pause]
first of all from t he NSA group and t hen from [ disfm arker] from ot her

m n082 [ s^ rt ] : But t his I have definit ely ou uh discussed wit h m y
m anagem ent
m n082 [ s] : and [ pause] t his will happened , I believe , in Decem ber ,
m n082 [ s] : m ay be , and in t he beginning of January .
m n082 [ s^ cc] : and I will keep inform ed t o t he m anagem ent of ICSI
anyway ,
m n082 [ s^ cs] : but also , I assum e t hat m y suggest ions t hat we have
a weekly phone conference and em ail exchange [ pause] during t hat
t im e
m n082 [ s^ df] : so t hat we can inform each ot her [ vocalsound]
concerning what are t he quest ions , what are t he problem s , what is
t he st at us and so on .
m n082 [ fh] : Uh ?
m n082 [ s] : But I t hink we will uh det ail t hese t hings t hen in one of t he

m n082 [ fh] : So
m n082 [ qw.%−−] : how is your st at us and [ disfm arker] and your ideas
and your plans and y our fut ure and [ disfm arker]
m n030 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n030 [ fh] : Well
m n030 [ s.%−] : I will [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ j] : You ’re addict ed t o t he t est beds you run on t he hour ,
m n030 [ s^ ar] : No , no , no , no , no .
m n082 [ s.%−] : so t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m n030 [ s^ rt ] : So I will st ay here t ill t he end of February
m n030 [ fh] : and
m n030 [ s] : aft erwards , um , at Berlin I ’m yeah , funded by an
inst it ut ion of t he Germ an governm ent ,
m n030 [ fh] : so ,
m n030 [ s^ rt ] : t hey are paying m e ,
m n030 [ s] : and I hav e t o do research for t hem , of course .
m n030 [ s] : I have t o [ vocalsound] um well , uh , reach som e goals and
so on .
m n030 [ s^ rt ] : But on t he ot her hand t here will be som e t im e left I
t hink t o do som e work on [ pause] t his area I st art ed here .
m n030 [ s^ rt ] : And for m e , m y self , I ’m also very int erest ed in
[ disfm arker] in cont inue t his work
m n030 [ s] : and so t hat will be m anageable
m n030 [ fh] : and , um ,
m n030 [ s.%−−] : on t he ot her hand t here are also [ vocalsound] uh ,
som e st udent s or [ disfm arker]

m n030 [ fh] : well ,
m n030 [ s] : at t he m om ent it ’s [ pause] quit e difficult t o find st udent s ,
eh , who are doing t heir m ast er ’s t hesis and so on
m n030 [ s^ df] : because t here are not a lot of st udent s , uh , which
are in t his st at e in Germ any now ,
m n030 [ fh] : but um ,
m n030 [ s] : about t wo years ago t he num bers of st udent s were , um ,
st udy ing com put er science , [ v ocalsound] uh , st art ed t o increase
again
m n030 [ s] : and so in one or t wo y ears we will have , [ vocalsound] uh ,
m any st udent s , uh , which are perform ing t heir m ast er ’s t hesis
m n030 [ s] : and so [ vocalsound] I t hink t here will also be , uh , m any
st udent s [ v ocalsound] which are joining in t his work .
m n030 [ fh|s] : So , hopefully , [ v ocalsound] uh , I will found [ disfm arker]
will find som e st udent s which are joining in
m n030 [ fh] : and , um
m n030 [ s] : So , hopefully t his work will be go on .
m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n082 [ s^ ba] : sounded good t o m e .
m n082 [ qy^ co^ d^ rt ] : And Michael ?
m n035 [ h|s^ cc] : So , [ pause] I won’t change t he t opic t hen .
m n035 [ s^ rt ] : I ’m here unt il end of May
m n035 [ s] : and aft er t hat I presum ably going t o a Siem ens project
wit h som e [ disfm arker] depart m ent of gee − m ens ,
m n035 [ s] : but relat ed t o t hat t opic what I have done here .
m n035 [ fh] : So ,
m n035 [ s] : it ’s som e of pre − st age [ pause] t o t hat ,
m n035 [ s^ df] : so it m ight be m ore [ vocalsound] relat ed or loosely
relat ed .
m n035 [ s^ bu] : So it ’s at least it ’s in t he sam e t opic .
m n035 [ s^ rt ] : And [ pause] progress , it ’s [ pause] going on ,
m n035 [ s] : but it ’s not t hat fast going on as I would have like it .
m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n035 [ %] : Oh ,
m n035 [ s] : I would like t o have it .
m n035 [ s^ fa] : Sorry .
m n035 [ fh] : Well
m n035 [ %] : but oder ?
m n082 [ s^ bk|qw^ rt ] : Yeah , t hen , what is t he current st at us anyway
?
m n035 [ h|s] : Um , I ’m [ disfm arker] current ly I ’m looking int o
[ v ocalsound] Qualit y of Service Rout ing ,
m n082 [ s] : t his is .
m n035 [ s] : and I had discussions wit h a post − doc from t he U − UCB .
m n035 [ fh] : Well ,

m n035 [ s^ rt ] : we want t o [ disfm arker] we st art ed t o collect
inform at ion t o [ vocalsound] writ e t he paper about Qualit y of Serving
[ pause] rout ing . [ vocalsound] for MPLS in an MPLS dom ain .
m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n035 [ s] : So you have [ pause] um dist ribut ed rout ing at t he edges ,
m n035 [ s] : and one aspect is [ vocalsound] t hat t he inform at ion is
out dat ed , so t hat y ou know t o always have t he exact inform at ion of
y our links , dat es , and so on .
m n035 [ s] : It what we have plans of t hat .
m n035 [ s] : And t ry ing t o [ vocalsound] look at som e rout ing [ pause]
policies , or rout ing algorit hm s .
m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s^ ba] : Now as I see , in principle , uh fff [ com m ent ] t hat ’s a
really raw view .
m n082 [ s] : MPLS offers cert ain kind of success of act ive rout ing ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : because in principle , t he forwarding pass is a lit t le bit
decoupled from t his [ disfm arker] from t he rout ing pass ,
m n035 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ df] : and t his was , in principle [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n082 [ s] : it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not really t he subject
m n035 [ %−] : It [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : but in a broader sense it could be seen in t hat sense .
m n035 [ b] : It d yeah .
m n082 [ s] : I t hink uh , t here are in a cert ain degree som e alignm ent
wit h [ disfm arker] wit h bot h of you guys ,
m n035 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m n035 [ s] : So at least from t he desh definit ion of Christ ian Tschudin ,
MPLS is a subset of [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] of act ive [ pause] rout e
act ive rout ing .
m n035 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So it ’s very [ disfm arker] [ pause] It ’s st at ic ?
m n035 [ s^ ar|qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : It ’s [ disfm arker] No , act ive ?
m n035 [ s^ df] : But it ’s sort of act ive [ pause] because t hey have t hese
program st at em ent s .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n082 [ s] : m aybe it ’s a separat ion , in principle , t hat I do not use
t he norm al t radit ional , [ vocalsound] uh , dat a forwarding pass
[ v ocalsound] and updat e , in principle , only t he rout ing inform at ion uh
, t o [ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker] t o use it .
m n035 [ %−] : But y
m n035 [ b] : Yeah .
m n035 [ b] : Yeah .

m n021 [ s] : Well , t hey are [ disfm arker] t hey are using t he [ disfm arker]
t he [ disfm arker] t he sam e idea of labelling [ pause] packet s
[ v ocalsound] wit h a [ disfm arker] wit h a cont ent descript or or

m n082 [ s^ cc] : but I will dist ribut e a list [ disfm arker] cont act list and @
@ t he int erest s of each part ner
m n082 [ s^ df] : so t hat everybody can see [ vocalsound] and everybody

m n082 [ s^ am ] : m aybe it ’s a sm all NSA group act ivit y it self , wit h no
linkage t o t he out er world
m n082 [ s^ am ] : m aybe it ’s a NSA group act ivit y wit h a linkage t o t he
out er world based on t he uh universit ies at hom e or t he com panies at
hom e
m n082 [ s] : t here ’s som e linkage
m n082 [ s] : and t he t hird st age is , let ’s say t here ’s a NSA group
act ivit y in t his area , [ vocalsound] uh , wit h t he support ed , um , hom e

univ ersit ies here in t his area .
m n082 [ s^ ba] : The last one , I t hink it ’s , uh , t he best one .
m n082 [ s] : But , you see t he quest ion is always " Where ’s t he m oney
?"
m n082 [ s:s^ fe] : and I say " Oh poo ,
m n082 [ s:s^ no] : current ly I don’t know . "
m n082 [ s] : The second quest ion is how long I st ay here
m n082 [ s:s^ no] : and say ooo , [ com m ent ] [ pause] I don’t know " ,
m n082 [ fh] : so
m n082 [ s] : ev ery body ’s wait ing .
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Yeah ,

m n082 [ s] : and t he only rea um , act ivit y could com e from t he NSA
group it self ,
m n082 [ s] : but I t hink it ’s a [ disfm arker] a work in process and t hat it
will t ake som e t im e and , uh , [ vocalsound] everyt hing m ust be just
set t led a lit t le bit m ore .
m n082 [ fg|s^ cs] : So , but anyway , I would like t o get cont ribut ions
from t he people here of t he NSA group concerning proposals ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : t his is a living t hing
m n082 [ fh] : and
m n082 [ s^ ba] : it ’s a pit y t hat Mult icast is , in principle , rem oved
m n082 [ s] : and we do not have any expert from Mult icast anym ore .
m n082 [ fh|s] : And , uh , t hat ’s m akes very hard , I believe .
m n082 [ s^ df] : Because t hat is a m ajor @ @ , at least t went y − five
percent of t he whole net work uh , st uff
m n082 [ fh] : and , um ,
m n082 [ s] : but nev erless we hav e t o live wit h t his sit uat ion .
m n082 [ fh] : Right .
m n082 [ qy^ bu^ d] : You are laughing , again ?
m n081 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n081 [ s^ aa^ r] : Right .
m n082 [ s^ cs] : So m aybe we have t o [ nonvocalsound] rewrit e
som et hing ,
m n082 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : have new ideas going forward m ore in cert ain kind
of really t elecom m unicat ion net work and t he rout ing and QS st uff ,
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : and rem ove , in principle , t he Mult icast st uff
m n082 [ s^ ba^ e] : which , in principle , a pit y because I t hink t hat ’s a
really really good eh [ disfm arker] uh [ pause] m m m source of research
work for t he fut ure t elecom m unicat ion core net works
m n082 [ s^ df] : because t hey are st ill not able t o deal wit h Mult icast ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : t hey st ill have t here t hat t unnel generat ions and all
t hose kind of t hings
m n082 [ fh|s^ ba^ df] : and I [ disfm arker] I believe t hat would be very
beneficial t o use it for t he really [ pause] uh , m obile scenarios in
[ disfm arker] in t hat net work ,
m n082 [ s] : so [ disfm arker] but anyway we have t o live wit h a real
sit uat ion
m n082 [ s] : and t hat m eans we have t o drop Mult icast from t he
proposal .
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : Any com m ent s ?
m n021 [ s^ nd] : Oh , not really , you know ,
m n021 [ fh|s] : uh , I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I t hink
t hat [ disfm arker] Well , in t he fut ure , som ebody will com e t o t he NSA
group
m n021 [ fh] : eh
m n082 [ s] : Then we can ext end t he proposal one m ore t im e wit h
Mult icast .

m n021 [ %] : Ah ,
m n021 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ ar|s.%−−] : No , I m ean [ vocalsound] t hat [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ fg] : OK ,
m n021 [ s^ nd] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat it cannot , eh ,
be , eh considered t he first t ype t ask t o do
m n021 [ s^ df] : because nobody is [ disfm arker] is knowledgeable
about m ult icast ing
m n021 [ s^ cs] : but I t hink t hat , eh , any of us could address t hese
t hings in t he fut ure ,
m n021 [ s^ cs] : or m aybe a new person could address t his . in t he
fut ure .
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ %−−] : if [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s] : I m ean , wh what I t hink is t hat , uh , it [ disfm arker] it
m akes no sense t o m e [ vocalsound] t o reduce , [ vocalsound] uh , uh ,
uh , uh , som et hing which is m ore or less com plet e ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : because we don’t have t he person .
m n021 [ s^ cs] : I t hink t hat t he [ disfm arker] t he way t o [ disfm arker] t o
go is probably t he opposit e , t o t ry t o find [ vocalsound] som et hing
which has [ v ocalsound] a m eaning by it self
m n021 [ s^ cs] : and t hen t ry t o get t he resources t o [ disfm arker] t o
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] t o do t his [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ ng] : Oh , m aybe you underst and m e in t he wrong way .
