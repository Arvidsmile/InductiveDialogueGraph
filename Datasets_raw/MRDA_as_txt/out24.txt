good qualit y close − t alking m ikes on every speaker .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , so let ’s [ disfm arker] let ’s [ disfm arker] So let ’s
just do agenda [ pause] building right now .
m e013 [ s] : OK , so let ’s t alk about t hat a bit .
fe016 [ s.%−] : I m ean , t hat was [ disfm arker]

som et hing ?

fe008 [ s^ na^ rt ] : Well , you [ disfm arker] you , um , already know about
t he m eet ing [ com m ent ] t hat ’s com ing up
fe008 [ s] : and I don’t know if [ disfm arker] if t his is appropriat e for t his
.
fe008 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : I m ean , m aybe [ disfm arker] m aybe it ’s som et hing we
should handle out side of t he m eet ing .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : What m eet ing ?
m e013 [ s^ bd^ rt |s^ aa^ rt ] : No , no , t hat ’s OK .
m e013 [ s] : We can [ disfm arker] so [ disfm arker] we can t a so n NIST is
[ disfm arker] NIST folks are com ing by next week
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cc^ rt ] : and so we can t alk about t hat .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : Who ’s com ing ?
m e013 [ s.%−] : I t hink
m e013 [ fh|s^ rt ] : Uh , uh , John Fiscus
fe008 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : and , uh , I t hink George Doddingt on will be around as well
.
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , OK , so we can t alk about t hat .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , I guess just hear about how t hings are going wit h , uh
, uh , t he t ranscript ions .
fe008 [ s^ aa.%] : Sure . Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : That ’s right .
m e013 [ s^ rt ^ t ] : That would sort a be an obvious t hing t o discuss .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ qo^ t ] : An − anyt hing else , uh , st rike anybody ?
fe016 [ s] : Uh , we st art ed [ pause] running recognit ion on [ pause] one
conv ersat ion
fe016 [ s] : but it ’s t he r [ pause] isn’t working yet .
fe016 [ fh] : So ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ %−] : Wha
fe016 [ s.%−−] : But if anyone has [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : uh , t he m ain t hing would be if anyone has , um , knowledge
about way s t o , uh , post − process t he wave form s t hat would give us
bet t er recognit ion ,
fe016 [ s] : t hat would be helpful t o know about .
m e013 [ fg] : Um ,
m e011 [ s] : Dom e
m e011 [ s^ cs^ na] : yeah , it sounds like a t opic of conversat ion .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ fh] : so , uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : What about , uh , is t here anyt hing new wit h t he
speech , nonspeech st uff ?

m n014 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , we ’re working m ore on it
m n014 [ s] : but , [ v ocalsound] it ’s not finished .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ t ] : Alright , t hat seem s like a [ disfm arker] a good collect ion
of t hings .
m e013 [ s] : And we ’ll undoubt edly t hink of [ pause] ot her t hings .
fe008 [ s^ t ] : I had t hought under m y t opic t hat I would m ent ion
fe008 [ s] : t he , uh , four it em s t hat I [ disfm arker] I , uh , put out for
being on t he agenda f on t hat m eet ing ,
fe008 [ s] : which includes like t he pre − segm ent at ion and t he
[ disfm arker] and t he developm ent s in m ult it rans .
m e013 [ s^ bs] : Oh , under t he NIST m eet ing .
fe008 [ s^ m ^ na] : Yeah , under t he NIST t hing .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Alright , why don’t we st art off wit h t his ,
m e013 [ fh] : u u
m e013 [ s] : I guess t he order we brought t hem up seem s fine .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ fg|s] : so , bet t er qualit y close t alking m ikes .
m e013 [ s] : So t he one issue was t hat t he [ disfm arker] t he , uh , lapel
m ike , uh , isn’t as good as you would like .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : And so , uh , it [ disfm arker] it ’d be bet t er if we had
close t alking m ikes for everybody .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ qy^ rt ] : Is t hat [ disfm arker] is t hat basically t he point ?
fe016 [ h] : Ri − um ,
fe016 [ s^ aa|%−−] : y eah , t he [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : And act ually in addit ion t o t hat , t hat t he [ disfm arker] t he
close t alking m ikes are worn in such a way as t o best capt ure t he
signal .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : And t he reason here is just t hat for t he people doing
work
fe016 [ s.%−−] : not on m icrophones but on sort of like dialogue and so
fort h ,
fe016 [ h|s.%−−] : uh [ disfm arker] or and even on prosody ,
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : which Don is gonna be working on soon ,
fe016 [ s] : it adds t his ext ra , you know , vari variable for each speaker
t o [ disfm arker] t o deal wit h when t he m icrophones aren’t sim ilar .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ fh|s] : So [ disfm arker] And I also t alked t o Mari t his m orning
fe016 [ s] : and she also had a st rong preference for doing t hat .
fe016 [ s] : And in fact she said t hat t hat ’s useful for t hem t o know in
st art ing t o collect t heir dat a t oo .

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fg|s.%−] : Right , so one t h
m e011 [ fg|%−] : Well , so [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : uh , well one t hing I was gonna say was t hat , um , i we
could get m ore , uh , of t he head m ount ed m icrophones
m e013 [ s] : ev en bey ond t he num ber of radio channels we have
m e013 [ s] : because I t hink whet her it ’s radio or wire is probably
second − order .
m e013 [ s] : And t he m ain t hing is having t he m icrophone close t o you ,
m e013 [ s^ bd^ df] : u alt hough , not t oo close .
fe016 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ b] : Right ,
m e011 [ s] : so , uh , act ually t he way Jose is wearing his is [ disfm arker]
is c [ pause] correct .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ %−−] : Is [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ e] : The good way .
m e011 [ s^ co.%−] : So you want t o [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : I it ’s not cor it ’s correct ?
m e013 [ s^ na] : Is .
m e011 [ s^ na] : Yeah , t h t hat ’s good .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So it ’s t owards t he corner of y our m out h so t hat breat h
sounds don’t get on it .
m e013 [ b] : Yes .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ co] : And t hen just sort of about , uh , a t hum b or
[ disfm arker] a t hum b and a half away from your [ disfm arker] from your
m out h .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s^ bk] : Uh , yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ qw.%−] : How am I d
fe016 [ s.%−−] : But we have m ore t han one t ype of [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−] : I m ean , for inst ance , you ’re [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : And t his one isn’t v ery adjust able ,
m e011 [ s] : so t his about as good as I can get
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : cuz it ’s a fixed boom .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s^ 2] : Is fix ed . Yeah .

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : But if we could act ually st andardize , you know , t he
[ disfm arker] t he m icrophones , uh , as m uch as possible t hat would be
really helpful .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Well , I m ean it doesn’t hurt t o have a few ext ra
m icrophones around ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : so why don’t we just go out and [ disfm arker] and
get an order of [ disfm arker] of
m e013 [ s] : if t his m icrophone seem s OK t o people ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : uh , I ’d just get a half dozen of t hese t hings .
m e011 [ s] : Well t he onl t he only problem wit h t hat is right now , um ,
som e of t he Jim let s aren’t working .
m e011 [ s^ e] : The lit t le [ disfm arker] t he boxes under t he t able .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : And so , w Uh , I ’ve only been able t o find t hree jacks t hat
are working .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Can we get t hese , wireless ?
m e011 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ar|s.%−] : No , but m y point is [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : But y we could just record t hese signals separat ely and
t im e align t hem wit h t he st art of t he m eet ing .
m e013 [ %−] : R r right [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I ’m not sure I ’m follow .
m e011 [ s^ co^ rt ] : Say t hat again ?
m e013 [ s] : Right now , we ’ve got , uh , t wo m icrophones in t he room ,
t hat are not quot e − unquot e st andard .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−] : So why don’t we replace t hose [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk|qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : OK , just t wo .
m e013 [ s] : Well , however m any we can plug in .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : You know , if we can plug in t hree , let ’s plug in t hree .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Also what we ’ve t alked before about get t ing anot her , uh ,
radio ,
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : and so t hen t hat would be , you know , t hree [ pause] m ore
.
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right . OK .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ co] : So , uh [ disfm arker] so we should go out t o our full
com plem ent of what ever we can do ,

m e013 [ s] : but hav e t hem all be t he sam e m ike .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink t he original reason t hat it was done t he ot her way
was because , it w it was sort of an experim ent al t hing
m e013 [ s] : and I don’t t hink any body knew whet her people would
rat her hav e m ore v ariet y or [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] or , uh , m ore
uniform it y ,
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker] @ @ [ com m ent ] but uh ,
m e013 [ s^ ba] : sounds [ disfm arker] sounds fine .
m e011 [ s] : Sounds like uniform it y wins .
m n005 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ df.%−−] : Well , for short t erm research it ’s just [ disfm arker]
t here ’s just so m uch effort t hat would have t o be done up front n uh ,
m e011 [ fg] : Well [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : so [ disfm arker] yeah , uniform it y would be great .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy .%−] : Is it because [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : You [ disfm arker] you ’re saying t he [ disfm arker]
for dialogue purposes ,
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : so t hat m eans t hat t he t ranscribers are having
t rouble wit h t hose m ikes ?
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t hat what you m ean ?
m e018 [ qrr.%−−] : Or [ disfm arker] ?
fe016 [ s] : Well Jane would know m ore about t he t ranscribers .
fe008 [ s] : And t hat ’s t rue .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : I m ean , I [ disfm arker] we did discuss t his .
fe008 [ fh] : Uh , and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m e011 [ s^ e] : Couple t im es .
fe008 [ s^ bk^ m ] : a couple t im es ,
fe008 [ fh|s.%−−] : so , um , yeah , t he t ranscribers not ice [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And in fact t here ’re som e where , um [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : ugh
fe008 [ s] : well , I m ean t here ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s t he double t hing .
fe008 [ s] : It ’s t he equipm ent and also how it ’s worn .
fe008 [ s] : And he ’s always [ disfm arker] t hey always [ disfm arker] t hey
just rav e about how wonderful Adam ’s [ disfm arker] Adam ’s channel is
.
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ qr] : What can I say .
fe008 [ %−] : And t hen ,
fe016 [ s] : So does t he recognizer .
m e011 [ qh] : Oh , really ?
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .

m e011 [ s] : Yeah , I ’m not surprised .
m e011 [ s:s^ fe] : I m ean , " Baaah ! "
fe008 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , but I m ean it ’s not just t hat , it ’s also you
know you
fe016 [ s.%−−] : Even if [ disfm arker] if you ’re t alking on som eone else ’s
m ike it ’s st ill [ pause] you w
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : It ’s also like n no breat hing ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : no [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : You know , it ’s like it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s um ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : it ’s really [ disfm arker] [ nonvocalsound] it m akes a big
difference from t he t ranscribers ’ point of view
m e011 [ s^ j] : Yeah , it ’s an advant age when you don’t breat h .
fe008 [ s] : and also from t he research s point of view .
m e013 [ s.%−] : When we ’re doing [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ df] : Yeah , I t hink t hat t he point of doing t he close t alking
m ike is t o get a good qualit y signal . We ’re not doing research on
close t alking m ikes .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So we m ight as well get it as uniform as we can .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : Now , t his is locking t he barn door aft er t he horse was
st olen .
m e013 [ s] : We do have t hirt y hours , of [ disfm arker] of speech , which
is done t his way .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : That ’s OK .
m e013 [ %−−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s] : but , uh , yeah , for fut ure ones we can get it a bit m ore
uniform .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : Great , great .
m e011 [ s] : So I t hink just do a field t rip at som e point .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah , probably [ disfm arker] yeah , t o t he st ore we t alked
about
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ %−−] : and t hat [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−] : And t here was som e t alk about , uh , m aybe t he h
headphones t hat are uncom fort able for people , t o [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg] : Yep .
m e011 [ s] : So , as [ disfm arker] as I said , we ’ll do a field t rip and see
if we can get all of t he sam e m ike t hat ’s m ore com fort able t han
[ disfm arker] t han t hese t hings , which I t hink are horrible .

fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Good .
fe016 [ s^ ba|s^ ft ] : Great , t hank you very m uch .
m e018 [ s^ 2^ j] : Especially for people wit h big heads .
m e013 [ fg] : OK .
fe016 [ s] : It ’s m akes our job a lot easier .
m e011 [ s^ df] : And , you know , we ’re researchers ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ j] : so we all have big heads .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : Uh ,
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ t ] : OK , second it em was t he , uh , NIST visit , and
what ’s going on t here .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ h] : OK , so , um , uh ,

fe008 [ fh] : And um .
fe008 [ s^ bd^ no] : So , I don’t know .

m n014 [ s] : now which is just , uh , speech − nonspeech det ect ion on
t he m ixed file .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : This is good . Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ s] : So I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m rely ing on [ disfm arker] on t he
segm ent at ion of t he m ixed file

m n014 [ s] : but I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m t rying t o subdivide t he speech
port ions int o different port ions if t here is som e act ivit y in [ disfm arker]
in different channels .
fe008 [ s^ bu] : Excellent , so t his ’d be like w e providing also speaker
ID [ pause] pot ent ially .
m n014 [ fg] : But [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Wonderful .
fe008 [ b] : Wonderful .
m e013 [ fg|s^ t .%−−] : Um , som et hing I guess I didn’t put in t he list but ,
uh , on t hat , uh , sam e day lat er on in [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bsc] : or m aybe it ’s [ disfm arker] No , act ually [ pause] it ’s
t his week ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh , Dave Gelbart and I will be , uh , visit ing wit h John
Canny
m e013 [ s^ e] : who i you know , is a CS professor ,
fe008 [ b.%] : Oh .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : HCC .
m e013 [ s^ e] : who ’s int erest ed in ar in array m icrophones .
m e011 [ s^ bu] : Oh , he ’s doing array m ikes .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And so we wanna see what com m onalit y t here is here .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : You know , m ay be t hey ’d wanna st ick an array m ike
here when we ’re doing t hings
m e018 [ s^ ba] : That would be cool .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Yeah , t hat would be neat .
m e013 [ s] : or [ disfm arker] or m ay be it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not a
specific array m icrophone t hey want
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ ba^ m ] : That would be really neat .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : but t hey m ight wanna just , [ disfm arker] uh , y ou know
, you could im agine t hem t aking t he four signals from t hese
[ disfm arker] t hese t able m ikes and t rying t o do som et hing wit h t hem
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um , I also had a discussion [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So , w uh , we ’ll be over [ disfm arker] over t here t alking
wit h him , um , aft er class on Friday .
m e013 [ fh|s^ cc] : Um , we ’ll let you know what [ disfm arker] what goes
wit h t hat .
m e013 [ s^ t c] : Also had a com plet ely unrelat ed t hing . I had a , uh ,
discussion t oday wit h , uh , Birger Kollm eier who ’s a , uh , a Germ an ,
uh , scient ist
m e013 [ s^ e] : who ’s got a fair sized group [ vocalsound] doing a range
of t hings .

m e013 [ s^ e] : It ’s sort of audit ory relat ed , largely for hearing aids
and so on .
m e013 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : but , uh , he does st uff wit h audit ory m odels and he ’s very
int erest ed in direct ionalit y , and locat ion , and [ disfm arker] and , uh ,
head m odels and [ pause] m icrophone t hings .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : And so , uh , he ’s [ disfm arker] he and possibly a
st udent , t here w
m e013 [ s] : t here ’s , uh , a st udent of his who gave a t alk here last
y ear ,
m e013 [ s] : uh , m ay com e here , uh , in t he fall for , uh , sort of a five
m ont h , uh , sabbat ical .
m e013 [ s] : So he m ight be around .
m e013 [ s] : Get him t o give som e t alks and so on .
m e013 [ s] : But any way , he m ight be int erest ed in [ pause] t his st uff .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ cs^ t c] : That [ disfm arker] t hat rem inds m e , I had a
[ disfm arker] a t hought of an int erest ing project t hat som ebody could
t ry t o do wit h [ pause] t he dat a from here ,
m e018 [ s^ cs^ e] : eit her using , you know , t he [ disfm arker] t he m ikes
on t he t able or using signal energies from t he head worn m ikes ,
m n005 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ cs^ e] : and t hat is t o t ry t o const ruct a m ap of where
people were sit t ing ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n005 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e011 [ s^ ng] : Well Dan [ disfm arker] Dan had worked on t hat . Dan
Ellis ,
m e018 [ fh|s.%−] : uh , based on [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ rt ] : Oh , did he ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Oh , t hat ’s int erest ing .
m e011 [ s] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he cross − correlat ion st uff ,
was [ disfm arker] was doing b beam − form ing .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : And so you could plot out who was sit t ing next t o who
m e018 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ na] : A lit t le bit ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : I m ean , he didn’t do a very ext rem e t hing but just
[ disfm arker] it was just sort of
m n005 [ b] : Yeah ,
m n005 [ b] : y eah .
m e011 [ s^ ar] : No ,
m e011 [ s^ nd] : he did st art on it .

m e013 [ s] : e e giv en t hat , t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he block
of wood wit h t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he t wo m ikes
[ com m ent ] on eit her side ,
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : if I ’m speaking , or if you ’re speaking , or som eone
ov er t here is speaking , it [ disfm arker] if you look at cross − correlat ion
funct ions , you end up wit h a [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : if [ disfm arker] if som eone who was on t he axis bet ween
t he t wo is t alking , t hen you [ disfm arker] you get a big peak t here .
m e013 [ s] : And if [ disfm arker] if som eone ’s t alking on [ disfm arker] on
[ disfm arker] on , uh , one side or t he ot her , it goes t he ot her way .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen , uh , it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it even looks
different if t h t if t he t wo [ disfm arker] t wo people on eit her side are
t alking t han if one in t he m iddle .
m e013 [ s^ r] : It [ disfm arker] it act ually looks som ewhat different ,
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : so .
m e018 [ s] : Well I was just t hinking , you know , as I was sit t ing here
next t o Thilo t hat um , when he ’s t alking , m y m ike probably picks it up
bet t er t han [ pause] your guys ’s m ikes .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ cs.%−] : So if you just looked at [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ 2^ bk] : Oh , t hat ’s anot her cl cue ,
m e011 [ s^ aa] : t hat ’s t rue .
m e018 [ fg|s] : yeah , [ com m ent ] looked at [ com m ent ] t he energy on
m y m ike and you could get an idea about who ’s closest t o who .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ 2^ j] : Or who t alks t he loudest .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah , well you have t o [ disfm arker] t he appropriat e
norm alizat ions are t ricky , and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and are
probably t he key .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ j] : You just search for Adam ’s voice on each individual
m icrophone , you pret t y m uch know where everybody ’s sit t ing .

m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s^ ng] : Yeah . We ’ve swit ched posit ions recent ly so you
can’t [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ t c] : Anyway .
m e013 [ s^ t c] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ t ] : So t hose are just a lit t le couple of news it em s .
fe008 [ qy ^ rt ^ t ] : Can I ask one t hing ?
fe008 [ fh] : Uh , so , um ,
fe008 [ s] : Jonat han Fiscus expressed an int erest in , uh , m icrophone
array s .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe008 [ fh|qy.%−−] : Um , is t here [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I m ean [ disfm arker] b And I also want t o say , his
[ disfm arker] he can’t st ay all day .
fe008 [ s] : He needs t o uh , leave for [ disfm arker] uh , from here t o
m ake a t wo fort y − five flight
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh , so just m orning .
fe008 [ s^ e] : from [ disfm arker] from Oakland .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : So it m akes t he scheduling a lit t le bit t ight
fe008 [ qr^ cs] : but do you t hink t hat , um [ disfm arker] t hat , uh , i John
Canny should be involved in t his som ehow or not .
fe008 [ s^ no] : I hav e no idea .
m e013 [ s^ ar] : Probably not
m e013 [ s^ e] : but I [ disfm arker] I ’ll [ disfm arker] I ’ll [ disfm arker] I ’ll
know bet t er aft er I see him t his Friday what [ disfm arker] what kind of
lev el he want s t o get involved .
fe008 [ s^ nd] : It ’s prem at ure .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Fine .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Good .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , he m ight be ex cit ed t o and it m ight be very
appropriat e for him t o , uh , or he m ight have no int erest what soever .
m e013 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I just really don’t know .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ qy.%−−] : Is he involved in [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Ach ! [ com m ent ] I ’m blanking on t he nam e of t he project .
m e011 [ s] : NIST has [ disfm arker] has done a big m eet ing room
[ disfm arker] inst rum ent ed m eet ing room wit h video and m icrophone
array s , and very elaborat e soft ware .
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is [ disfm arker] is he t he one working on t hat ?
m e013 [ s^ na] : Well t hat ’s what t hey ’re st art ing up .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah . No , I m ean , t hat ’s what all t his is about . They
[ disfm arker] t hey hav en’t done it yet .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ e] : They want ed t o do it [ disfm arker]

m e011 [ s] : I had read som e papers t hat looked like t hey had already
done som e work .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , well I t hink t hey ’ve inst rum ent ed a room
m e013 [ s] : but I don’t [ pause] t hink t hey [ disfm arker] t hey haven’t
st art ed recordings yet .
m e013 [ s] : They don’t have t he t t he t ranscript ion st andards .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Are t hey going t o do v ideo as well ?
m e013 [ s.%−] : They don’t hav e t he [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b.%] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s^ am ] : I t hink .
m e013 [ s^ am ^ r] : I t hink t hey are .
m e011 [ s] : Oh , cuz what [ disfm arker] what I had read was , uh , t hey
had a uh very large am ount of soft ware infrast ruct ure for coordinat ing
all t his ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : bot h in t erm s of recording and also live room where you
’re int eract ing [ disfm arker] t he part icipant s are int eract ing wit h t he
com put er , and wit h t he video , and lot s of ot her st uff .
m e013 [ s^ no] : Well , I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m not sure .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s] : All [ disfm arker] all I know is t hat t hey ’ve been t alking t o
m e about a project t hat t hey ’re going t o st art up recording people
m eet in m eet ings .
m e011 [ fg] : OK . Well [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : And , uh , it is relat ed t o ours .
m e013 [ s] : They were int erest ed in ours .
m e013 [ s] : They want ed t o get som e uniform it y wit h us , uh , about
t he t ranscript ions and so on .
m e011 [ b] : Alright .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And one [ disfm arker] one not able difference
[ disfm arker] u u
m e013 [ s^ no] : act ually I can’t rem em ber whet her t hey were going t o
rout inely collect v ideo or not ,
m e013 [ s] : but one [ disfm arker] one , uh , difference from t he audio
side was t hat t hey are int erest ed in using array m ikes .
m e013 [ fh|s] : So , um , I m ean , I ’ll just t ell you t he part y line on t hat .
m e013 [ s^ df] : The reason I didn’t go for t hat here was because , uh ,
t he focus , uh , bot h of m y int erest and of Adam ’s int erest was uh , in
im prom pt u sit uat ions .
m e013 [ fh] : And
m e013 [ s] : we ’re not recording a bunch of im prom pt u sit uat ions
m e013 [ s^ df] : but t hat ’s because it ’s different t o get dat a for
research t han t o act ually apply it .
m n005 [ b] : Hm m .

m e013 [ s^ df] : And so , uh , for scient ific reasons we t hought it was
good t o inst rum ent t his room as we want ed it .
m e013 [ s] : But t he t hing we ult im at ely want ed t o aim at was a
sit uat ion where y ou were t alking wit h , uh , one or m ore ot her people i
uh , in [ disfm arker] in an p im prom pt u way , where you didn’t
[ disfm arker] didn’t act ually know what t he sit uat ion was going t o be .
m e013 [ s] : And t herefore it would not [ disfm arker] it ’d be highly
unlikely t hat room would be out fit t ed wit h [ disfm arker] wit h som e very
carefully designed array of m icrophones .
m e013 [ fh|s^ df] : Um , so it was only for t hat reason . It was just , you
know , y et anot her piece of research
m e013 [ s.%−] : and it seem ed like we had enough t roubles just
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ rt ] : So t here ’s no like port able array of m ikes ?
m e013 [ s^ ar|s^ ng] : No . So t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s [ disfm arker]
uh , t here ’s a whole range of t hings [ disfm arker] t here ’s a whole
array of t hings , [ v ocalsound] t hat people do on t his .
m n005 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So , um ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : t he , uh [ disfm arker] t he big arrays ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : uh , places , uh , like uh , Rut gers , and Brown , and
ot her [ disfm arker] ot her places ,
m e013 [ s] : uh , t hey have , uh , big arrays wit h , I don’t know , a
hundred [ disfm arker] hundred m ikes or som et hing .
m e011 [ s.%] : Xerox .
m e013 [ s] : And so t here ’s a wall of m ikes .
m e013 [ s] : And you get really , really good beam − form ing [ com m ent ]
wit h t hat sort of t hing .
m e018 [ s^ fe] : Wow .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And it ’s [ disfm arker] and , um ,
m e013 [ s] : in fact at one point we had a [ disfm arker] a proposal in
wit h Rut gers where we were gonna do som e of t he sort of per channel
signal − processing
m e013 [ s] : and t hey were gonna do t he m ult i − channel st uff ,
m e013 [ s] : but [ pause] it d it d we ended up not doing it .
m e013 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : I ’v e seen dem onst rat ions of t he m icrophone arrays . It ’s
am azing how [ disfm arker] how t hey can cut out noise .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Yeah , it ’s r It ’s really neat st uff .
m e011 [ s] : And t hen t hey have lit t le ones t oo
m e013 [ s^ aa^ m ] : And t hen t hey had t he lit t le ones , yeah .
m e011 [ s] : but I m ean [ disfm arker] but t hey don’t have our block of
wood ,
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ j] : Yeah , our block of wood is unique .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ %−−] : But t he [ vocalsound] But t he
m e013 [ s] : No , t here are t hese com m ercial t hings now you can buy
t hat hav e four m ikes or som et hing
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and , uh ,
m e013 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So , y eah , t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here
’s a range of t hings t hat people do .
m e018 [ b] : Huh .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , so if we connect ed up wit h som ebody who was
int erest ed in doing t hat sort of t hing t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a good
t hing t o do .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , whenever I ’ve described t his t o ot her people who
are int erest ed on t he [ disfm arker] wit h t he acoust ic side t hat ’s
inv ariably t he quest ion t hey ask .
m e013 [ s:qy ] : Just like som eone who is int erest ed in t he general
dialogue t hing will always ask [ vocalsound] " um , are you recording
v ideo ? "
m e013 [ fh|qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Um , right ?
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right ,
m e013 [ s:qy ] : And [ disfm arker] and t he acoust ic people will always say
, " well are you doing , uh , uh , array m icrophones ? "
fe016 [ s^ aa^ r] : right .
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s a good t hing t o do , but it doesn’t
solv e t he problem of how do you solve t hings when t here ’s one m ike
or at best t wo m ikes in [ disfm arker] in t his im agined PDA t hat we have
.
m e013 [ s^ cs] : So m aybe [ disfm arker] m aybe we ’ll do som e m ore of it
.
fe008 [ s^ cs.%−−] : Well one t hing I [ disfm arker] I m ean , I don’t know .
fe008 [ s] : I m ean , I know t hat hav ing an array of [ disfm arker] I m ean ,
I would im agine it would be m ore expensive t o have a [ disfm arker] an
array of m icrophones .
fe008 [ qy ^ cs^ rt ] : But couldn’t you kind of approxim at e t he nat ural sis
sit uat ion by just shut t ing off uh , channels when you ’re [ disfm arker]
lat er on ?
fe008 [ qy ^ cs^ rt ] : I m ean , it seem s like if t he m icrophones don’t
effect each ot her t hen couldn’t you just , you know , record t hem wit h
an array and t hen just not use all t he dat a ?
m e011 [ s^ ng] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s just a lot of infrast ruct ure t hat for
our part icular purpose we felt we didn’t need t o set up .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : I see .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Fine .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : Yeah , if ninet y − nine percent of what you ’re doing is c
is shut t ing off m ost of t he m ikes , t hen going t hrough t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : But if you get som ebody who ’s [ disfm arker] who
[ disfm arker] who has t hat as a prim ary int erest t hen t hat put
[ disfm arker] t hen t hat drives it in t hat direct ion .
m e011 [ s] : That ’s right , I m ean if som eone [ disfm arker] if som eone
cam e in and said we really want t o do it ,
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , we don’t care .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : That would be fine ,
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So t o save t hat dat a you [ disfm arker] You have
t o hav e one channel recording per m ike in t he array ?
m e011 [ s] : Buy m ore disk space .
m e018 [ qy.%−] : Is t hat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ h|s^ aap] : Well , uh , at som e level [ disfm arker] at som e level .
m e011 [ s] : I usually do a m ix .
m e013 [ s.%−] : But t hen , you know , t here ’s [ disfm arker] it
[ disfm arker] t here ’s [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ e] : What you save , I m ean , if you ’re going t o do research
wit h it . y eah
m e013 [ %−−] : There ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know what t hey ’re going t o do
and I don’t know how big t heir array is .
m e013 [ s] : Obv iously if you were gonna save all of t hose channels for
lat er research y ou ’d use up a lot of space .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Well t heir soft ware infrast ruct ure had a very elaborat e
design for plugging in filt ers , and m ixers , and all sort s of processing .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ %−] : And , t h
m e011 [ s] : So t hat t hey can do st uff in real t im e and not save out
each channel indiv idually .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ %−−] : So it was , uh [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : But I m ean , uh , for opt im um flexibilit y lat er you ’d want
t o sav e each channel .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : But I t hink in pract ical sit uat ions you would have som e
engine of som e sort doing som e processing t o reduce t his t o som e
[ disfm arker] t o t he equivalent of a single m icrophone t hat was very
direct ional .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Uh , oh , OK , I see .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]

fe016 [ s.%−] : I m ean , it seem s [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bs] : Sort of saving t he result of t he beam − form ing .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : it seem s t o m e t hat t here ’s [ disfm arker] you know , t here
are good polit ical reasons for [ disfm arker] for doing t his ,
fe016 [ s^ e] : just get t ing t he dat a ,
fe016 [ s^ df.%−−] : because t here ’s a num ber of sit es [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ df] : like right now SRI is probably gonna invest a lot of
int ernal funding int o recording m eet ings also , which is good ,
fe016 [ fh|s] : um , but t hey ’ll be recording wit h video
fe016 [ s.%−−] : and t hey ’ll be [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ cs] : You know , it ’d be nice if we can have at least , uh ,
m ake use of t he dat a t hat we ’re recording as we go
fe016 [ s^ df] : since it ’s sort of [ disfm arker] t his is t he first sit e t hat
has really collect ed t hese really im prom pt u m eet ings ,
fe016 [ s] : um , and just have t his ot her inform at ion available .
fe016 [ s^ cs.%−−] : So , if we can get t he invest m ent in just for t he infra
infrast ruct ure
fe016 [ %−−] : and t hen ,
fe016 [ s^ bd] : I don’t know ,
fe016 [ s^ cs.%−−] : save it out
fe016 [ s^ cs.%−−] : or have whoev er ’s int erest ed
fe016 [ s^ cs] : save t hat dat a out ,
fe016 [ s^ cs] : t ransfer it t here ,
fe016 [ s] : it ’d be g it ’d be good t o have [ disfm arker] have t he
recording . I t hink .
m e011 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : You m ean t o [ disfm arker] t o act ually get a
m icrophone array and do t hat ?
fe016 [ %−] : Well , if [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy^ d^ g.%−−] : And video and [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ %−] : Even if we ’re not [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ no^ rt ] : I ’m not sure about video .
fe016 [ s^ df.%−−] : That ’s sort of an [ disfm arker] video has a lit t le
different nat ure since
fe016 [ s] : right n right now we ’re all being recorded but we ’re not
being t aped .
fe016 [ s.%−] : Um , but it [ disfm arker] definit ely in t he case of
m icrophone arrays , since if t here was a com m unit y int erest ed in t his ,
t hen [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg|s^ cs^ ng] : Well , but I t hink we need a researcher here who
’s int erest ed in it . To push it along .
m e013 [ s] : See t he problem is it [ disfm arker] it t ook , uh , uh , it t ook
at least six m ont hs for Dan t o get t oget her t he hardware and t he
soft ware , and debug st uff in [ disfm arker] in t he m icrophones , and in
t he box es .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : And it was a really big deal .

m e013 [ s] : And so I t hink we could get a m icrophone array in here
pret t y easily
m e013 [ s] : and , uh , have it m ixed t o [ disfm arker] t o one channel of
som e sort .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But , e I t hink for
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : I m ean , how we ’re gonna decide [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : For [ disfm arker] for m axim um flexibilit y lat er you really don’t
want t o end up wit h just one channel t hat ’s point ed in t he direct ion of
t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he p t he person wit h t he m axim um
energy or som et hing like t hat .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : I m ean , you [ disfm arker] you want act ually t o
[ disfm arker] you want act ually t o hav e m ult iple channels being
recorded so t hat you can [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : And t o do t hat , it [ disfm arker] we ’re going t o end up
great ly increasing t he disk space t hat we use up ,
m e013 [ s] : we also only have boards t hat will t ake up t o sixt een
channels
m e013 [ s] : and in [ pause] t his m eet ing , we ’ve got eight people and
[ disfm arker] and six m ikes .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : And t here we ’re already using fourt een .
m e011 [ s^ bc] : And we act ually only have fift een .
m e011 [ %−−] : One of t hem ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−−] : E
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Det ails .
m e011 [ s] : But fift een , not sixt een .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs.%−−] : Well if t here ’s a way t o say t im e [ disfm arker] t o sort
of solv e each of t hese f t hose [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : So suppose you can get an array in because t here ’s som e
person at Berkeley who ’s int erest ed and has som e [ pause] equipm ent
,
fe016 [ s] : uh , and suppose we can [ disfm arker] as we save it we can
, you know , t ransfer it off t o som e ot her place t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
holds t his [ disfm arker] t his dat a ,
fe016 [ s] : who ’s int erest ed ,
fe016 [ s] : and ev en if ICSI it it self isn’t .
fe016 [ qy ^ rt ] : Um , and it [ disfm arker] it seem s like as long as we can
t im e align t he beginning , do we need t o m ix it wit h t he rest ?
fe016 [ s^ no^ rt ] : I don’t know .
fe016 [ %−−] : You know ? The
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah . So I t hink you ’d need a separat e [ disfm arker] a
separat e set up

fe016 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : and t he assum pt ion t hat you could t im e align t he t wo .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : And y it ’d cert ainly get s skew .
fe016 [ s^ cs.%−−] : I m ean it ’s just [ disfm arker] it ’s wort h considering
as sort of
fe016 [ s] : once you m ake t he up front invest m ent [ com m ent ] and can
sort of save it out each t im e , and [ disfm arker] and not have t o worry
about t he disk space fact or , t hen it m i it m ight be wort h having t he
dat a .
m e013 [ s^ nd] : I ’m not so m uch worried about disk space act ually .
m e013 [ s] : I m ent ioned t hat , b as a pract ical m at t er ,
m e011 [ %−] : Just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : but t he real issue is t hat , uh , t here is no way t o do a
recording ex t ended t o what we hav e now wit h low skew .
m e013 [ s] : So [ pause] you would hav e a t com plet ely separat e set up
,
m e013 [ s] : which would m ean t hat t he sam pling t im es and so fort h
would be all over t he place com pared t o t his .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : So it would depend on t he level of pr processing you were
doing lat er ,
m e013 [ s] : but if you ’re d i t he kind of person who ’s doing array
processing you act ually care about funny lit t le t im es .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : And [ disfm arker] and so you act ually wou would want t o
have a com plet ely different set up t han we have ,
fe016 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ s] : one t hat would go up t o t hirt y − t wo channels or som et hing
.
fe016 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s.%−] : So basically [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aap] : Or a hundred t hirt y − t wo .
m e013 [ s^ aa^ m .%−−] : or a hun
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So , I ’m kinda skept ical ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but um I t hink t hat [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : So , uh , I don’t t hink we can share t he resource in t hat
way .
m e013 [ s] : But what we could do is if t here was som eone else who ’s
int erest ed t hey could have a separat e set up which t hey wouldn’t be
t ry ing t o synch wit h ours
m e013 [ s] : which m ight be useful for [ disfm arker] for t hem .
fe016 [ s^ bk|s^ aap] : Right , I m ean at least t hey ’d have t he dat a and
t he t ranscript s ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : And t hen we can offer up t he room ,

fe016 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , we can o offer t he m eet ings , and t he physical
space ,
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] yeah , t he t ranscript s ,
and so on .
fe016 [ b] : OK .
fe016 [ fg|s] : Right , I m ean , just [ disfm arker] it ’d be nice if we have
m ore inform at ion on t he sam e dat a .
fe016 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : You know ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : But it ’s [ disfm arker] if it ’s im possible or if it ’s a lot of effort
t hen you hav e t o just balance t he t wo ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Well I t hi
m e013 [ fh|s] : yeah , t he t hing will be , u u in [ disfm arker] in
[ disfm arker] again , in t alking t o t hese ot her people t o see what
[ disfm arker] you know , what [ disfm arker] what we can do .
fe016 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ cc] : Uh , we ’ll see .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t here an int erest in get t ing video recordings for
t hese m eet ings ?
m e018 [ %−−] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e018 [ s.%−−] : I m ean
m e013 [ fg|%−] : Right , so we have [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa|s] : Yes , absolut ely . But it ’s exact ly t he sam e problem ,
m e011 [ s] : t hat you have an infrast ruct ure problem ,
m e011 [ s] : y ou have a problem wit h people not want ing t o be video
t aped ,
m e011 [ s] : and you have t he problem t hat no one who ’s current ly
inv olv ed in t he project is really hot t o do it .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ s^ bs.%−] : So t here ’s not enough int erest t o overcom e all of
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : Right . Int ernally ,
fe016 [ s] : but I know t here is int erest from ot her places t hat are
int erest ed in looking at m eet ing dat a and having t he video .
fe016 [ s.%−] : So it ’s just [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ fg|s] : Yeah , w alt hough I [ disfm arker] m [ vocalsound] I
[ disfm arker] I have t o u u m ent ion t he hum an subject s problem s ,
[ pause] t hat i increase wit h video .
fe016 [ s^ bk|s^ na] : Right , t hat ’s t rue .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah , so it ’s , uh , people [ disfm arker] people get t ing
shy about it .

fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : There ’s t his hum an subject s problem .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : There ’s t he fact t hat t hen um , if [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : i I I ’ve heard com m ent s about t his before ,
m e013 [ s:qw] : " why don’t you just put on a video cam era ? "
m e013 [ s] : But y ou know , it ’s sort of like saying , " uh , well we ’re
prim arily int erest ed in [ disfm arker] in som e dialogue t hings ,
m e013 [ qo^ df] : uh , but , uh , why don’t we just t hrow a m icrophone
out t here . "
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , t he t hing is , once y ou act ually have serious
int erest in any of t hese t hings t hen you act ually have t o put a lot of
effort in .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : And , uh , you really want t o do it right .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : I know .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ s] : So I t hink NIST or LDC , or som ebody like t hat I t hink is
m uch bet t er shape t o do all t hat .
m e013 [ s] : We [ disfm arker] t here will be ot her m eet ing recordings .
We won’t be t he only place doing m eet ing recordings .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : We are doing what we ’re doing .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : And , uh , hopefully it ’ll be useful .
fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : I [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it occurred t o m e , has Don
signed a hum an subject ’s form ?
m e011 [ s] : Oh ! Probably not .
fe008 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : A perm ission form ?
m e011 [ qy .%−−] : Has Don [ disfm arker] have you s did you si
m e011 [ s] : I t hought you did act ually .
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Didn’t you read a digit st ring ?
m e001 [ s] : I was [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] Yeah , I was [ disfm arker] I
was here [ disfm arker] I was here before once .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : You were here at a m eet ing before .
fe008 [ s^ bu] : You were here at a m eet ing before .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ bu] : Yeah , and you [ disfm arker] and you signed a

m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e001 [ fh] : So .
fe008 [ qy^ rt ] : Did you sign a form ?
m e001 [ s^ am ] : Oh , I t hink so .
m e001 [ qy ^ rt ^ t 1] : Did I ?
m e011 [ s] : I ’m pret t y sure .
m e001 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m e011 [ s^ cc] : Well I ’ll [ disfm arker] I ’ll get anot her one before t he

fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m e011 [ s^ ft ^ t c] : Thank you .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e001 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : You don’t [ disfm arker] you don’t have t o leave for it .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : But I just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : Yeah , we [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ f] : y ou know .
m e011 [ s] : Well I can’t ,
m e001 [ qy ^ rt ] : Can I verbally consent ?
m e011 [ s^ df] : I ’m wired in .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : We [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] we
don’t , uh [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ %−] : o
fe016 [ s] : You ’re on recor you ’re being recorded
m e001 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s] : I don’t care .
m e013 [ s^ j] : we don’t [ disfm arker] we don’t perform elect ro − shock
during t hese m eet ings ,
m e001 [ s^ cs] : You can do what ever you want wit h it .
m e001 [ s^ ba] : That ’s fine .
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ 2^ j] : Usually .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Uh , t ranscript ions .
fe008 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Transcript ions , OK .
fe008 [ s] : Um , I t hought about [ disfm arker] t here are m aybe t hree
aspect s of t his .
fe008 [ s] : So first of all , um , I ’ve got eight t ranscribers .
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : Uh , seven of t hem are linguist s .
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : One of t hem is a graduat e st udent in psychology .
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : Um , Each [ disfm arker] I gave each of t hem , uh , t heir
own dat a set .
fe008 [ s] : Two of t hem have already finished t he dat a set s .
fe008 [ s] : And [ pause] t he m eet ings run , you know , let ’s say an
hour . Som et im es as m an m uch as an hour and a half .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : How big is t he dat a set ?
fe008 [ s] : Oh , it ’s [ disfm arker] what I m ean is one m eet ing .
fe008 [ s] : Each [ disfm arker] each person got t heir own m eet ing .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Ah , OK .
fe008 [ s] : I didn’t want t o have any conflict s of , you know , of
[ disfm arker] of when t o st op t ranscribing t his one

fe008 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : So I want ed t o keep it clear whose dat a were whose ,
fe008 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and so [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b^ rt ] : Uh − huh .
fe008 [ s] : And , uh , m eet ings , you know , I t hink t hat t hey ’re
[ disfm arker] t hey go as long as a [ disfm arker] alm ost t wo hours in
som e [ disfm arker] in som e cases .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So , y ou know , t hat m eans [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : y ou know , if we ’v e got t wo already finished and t hey ’re
working on [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : Uh , right now all eight of t hem have differe uh , uh ,
addit ional dat a set s . That m eans pot ent ially as m any as t en m ight be
finished by t he end of t he m ont h .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Hope so .
m e018 [ s^ ba^ fe] : Wow .
fe008 [ s] : But t he pre − segm ent at ion really helps a huge am ount .
m n014 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : And , uh , also Dan Ellis ’s innovat ion of t he , uh
[ disfm arker] t he m ult i − channel t o here really helped a r a lot in t erm s
of clearing [ disfm arker] clearing up h hearings t hat involve ov erlaps .
fe008 [ fh] : But , um ,
fe008 [ s] : just out of curiosit y I asked one of t hem how long [ pause] it
was t aking her , one of t hese t wo who has already finished her dat a
set .
fe008 [ s] : She said it t akes about , uh , sixt y m inut es t ranscript ion for
ev ery fiv e m inut es of real t im e .
fe008 [ s] : So it ’s about t welve t o one ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : which is what we were t hinking .
m e011 [ %−−] : or
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
fe008 [ s] : It ’s well in t he range .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : It ’s pret t y good .
fe008 [ s^ bk|s] : OK . Uh , t hese st ill , when t hey ’re finished , um , t hat
m eans t hat t hey ’re finished wit h t heir pass t hrough . They st ill need t o
be edit ed and all
fe008 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] But it ’s word level , speaker change , t he
t hings t hat were m ent ioned .
fe008 [ s^ t ^ t c] : OK , now I want ed t o m ent ion t he , um ,
t eleconference I had wit h , uh , Jonat han Fiscus .
fe008 [ s] : We spoke for an hour and a half
m e011 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s] : and , um , had an awful lot of t hings in com m on .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : He , um , um , he in indicat ed t o m e t hat t hey ’ve
[ disfm arker] t hat he ’s been ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : uh , looking , uh , uh , spending a lot of t im e wit h
[ disfm arker]

fe008 [ s^ no] : I ’m not quit e sure t he connect ion ,
fe008 [ s] : but spending a lot of t im e wit h t he ATLAS syst em .
fe008 [ s] : And I guess t hat [ disfm arker] I m ean , I [ disfm arker] I need
t o read up on t hat .
fe008 [ s] : And t here ’s a web sit e t hat has lot s of papers .
fe008 [ s] : But it looks t o m e like t hat ’s t he nam e t hat has developed
for t he sy st em t hat Bird and Liberm an developed [ com m ent ] for t he
annot at ed [ pause] graphs approach .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So what he want s m e t o do
fe008 [ s] : and what we [ disfm arker] what we will do and [ disfm arker]
uh , is t o provide t hem wit h t he u already t ranscribed m eet ing
fe008 [ s] : for him t o be able t o experim ent wit h in t his ATLAS Syst em .
fe008 [ s] : And t hey do have som e sort of soft ware ,
fe008 [ s] : at least t hat ’s m y im pression , relat ed t o ATLAS
fe008 [ s] : and t hat he want s t o experim ent wit h t aking our dat a
fe008 [ s] : and put t ing t hem in t hat form at , and see how t hat works
out .
fe008 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I explained t o him in
[ disfm arker] in det ail t he , uh , convent ions t hat we ’re using here in
t his [ disfm arker] in t his word level t ranscript .
fe008 [ fh] : And , um ,
fe008 [ s] : you know , I [ disfm arker] I explained , you know , t he
reasons t hat [ disfm arker] t hat we were not coding m ore elaborat ely
fe008 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and t he focus on reliabilit y .
fe008 [ s] : He expressed a lot of int erest in reliabilit y .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : It ’s like he ’s [ disfm arker] he ’s really up on t hese
t hings .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : He ’s [ disfm arker] he ’s very [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s:qw] : Um , independent ly he asked , " well what about
reliabilit y ? "
fe008 [ s] : So , [ v ocalsound] he ’s int erest ed in t he consist ency of t he
encoding and t hat sort of t hing .
fe008 [ fh] : OK , um [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fg] : Sorry ,
fe016 [ qy^ rt .%−−] : can you explain what t he ATLAS [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : I ’m not fam iliar wit h t his ATLAS syst em .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well , you know , at t his point I t hink [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bd^ df] : Uh , well Adam ’s read m ore [ disfm arker] in m ore
det ail t han I hav e on t his .
fe008 [ s] : I need t o acquaint m yself m ore wit h it .
fe008 [ fh|s.%−−] : But , um , t here [ disfm arker] t here is a way of viewing
[ disfm arker]

fe008 [ s] : Uh , whenever you have coding cat egories , um , and you
’re dealing wit h uh , a t axonom y , t hen y ou can have branches t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat have alt ernat ive , uh , choices t hat you could use for
each [ disfm arker] each of t hem .
fe008 [ s] : And it just ends up looking like a graphical represent at ion .
m e011 [ qy .%−] : Is [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is ATLAS t he [ disfm arker] his annot at ed t ranscript ion
graph st uff ?
m e011 [ s^ no.x] : I don’t rem em ber t he acronym .
m e011 [ s.x ] : The [ disfm arker] t he one [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker]
what I t hink you ’re referring t o , t hey [ disfm arker] t hey hav e t his
concept of an an annot at ed t ranscript ion graph represent at ion .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : And t hat ’s basically what I based t he form at t hat I did
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Oh . Oh .
m e011 [ s] : I based it on t heir work alm ost direct ly , in com binat ion
wit h t he TEI st uff .
m e011 [ s] : And so it ’s very , v ery sim ilar .
m e011 [ s] : And so it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s a dat a represent at ion and a
set of t ools for m anipulat ing t ranscript ion graphs of various t ypes .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t his t he project t hat ’s sort of , uh , bet ween , uh ,
NIST and [ disfm arker] and , uh , a couple of ot her places ?
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e011 [ b.%] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : And t hen what he ’s going t o do is check it ,
m e018 [ s^ fe] : Oh .
fe008 [ s^ e] : a before t hey go be beyond t he first one .

[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .

fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ cs.%−] : Well if you ’re t ran if y ou got t hat channel right
t here [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ %−] : d uh , in m y case [ disfm arker]

t hat m ake sense when you know what t he person was saying before .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e018 [ %−−] : t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−] : And especially since a lot of t hese [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−] : Uh , it sort of depends where you are in [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : But I m ean we had t his [ disfm arker] we ’ve had t his

m e011 [ s] : And t he answer is we don’t act ually know t he answer
because we haven’t t ried bot h ways .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , we have .
fe008 [ s^ ng] : Well , except I can say t hat m y t ranscribers use t he

fe016 [ s.%−] : In ot her words , if [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ no] : Well , I have t o ask him .

fe016 [ %−] : Cuz [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ fh|s] : But [ disfm arker] but t he , uh [ disfm arker] I did want t o
say t hat it ’s hard t o follow one channel of a conversat ion even if you
know t he people ,
fe008 [ s] : and if y ou ’re dealing furt herm ore wit h highly abst ract
net work concept s you ’ve never heard of [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : So , y ou know , one of t hese people was [ disfm arker] was
t ranscribing t he , uh , net works group t alk
fe008 [ s:s] : and she said , " I don’t really know what a lot of t hese
abbrev iat ions are , "
fe008 [ s.%−−:s.%−−] : " but I just put t hem in parent heses cuz t hat ’s t he
[ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he convent ion and I just " [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−] : Cuz y ou know , if you don’t know [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Oh , I ’d be curious t o [ disfm arker] t o look at t hat .
m e018 [ s.%−] : Just out of curiosit y , I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : They also all have h heav y accent s .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : The net works group m eet ings are all [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qw] : Given all of t he effort t hat is going on here in t ranscribing
why do we have I B M doing it ?
m e018 [ qw] : Why not just do it all ourselves ?
m e013 [ h|s] : Um , it ’s hist orical .
m e013 [ fh] : I m ean ,
m e013 [ s] : uh , som e point ago we t hought t hat uh , it [ disfm arker] "
boy , we ’d really have t o ram p up t o do t hat " ,
m n005 [ %−] : No , just [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : you know , like we just did ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ s] : and , um , here ’s , uh , a [ disfm arker] a , uh ,
collaborat ing inst it ut ion t hat ’s v olunt eered t o do it .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So , t hat was a cont ribut ion t hey could m ake . Uh in t erm s
of t im e , m oney , y ou know ?
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : And it st ill m ight be a good t hing
m e018 [ s.%−] : I ’m just wondering now [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ %−] : Act u
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ r.%−] : Well , I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m wondering now if it ’s
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−] : yeah , Mar − Mari asked m e t he sam e quest ion as sort of
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ co] : Well we can t alk about m ore det ails lat er .
fe016 [ fh|%−−] : um , you know ,
fe016 [ s^ bk] : y eah ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe016 [ %−] : whet her t o [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk^ r] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ b] : so .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s^ co] : We ’ll see .
m e013 [ s^ co] : I m ean , I t hink , t h you know , t hey [ disfm arker] t hey
[ disfm arker] t hey ’v e proceeded along a bit . Let ’s see what com es out
of it , and [ disfm arker] and , uh , you know , have som e m ore
discussions wit h t hem .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : It ’s very [ disfm arker] a real benefit having Brian
inv olv ed
fe008 [ s^ df] : because of his knowledge of what t he [ disfm arker] how
t he dat a need t o be used and so what ’s useful t o have in t he form at .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fg|qy ^ rt ] : So , um , Liz , wit h [ disfm arker] wit h t he SRI
recognizer , [ com m ent ] can it m ake use of som e t im e m arks ?
fe016 [ h|s.%−] : OK , so t his is a , um ,
m e011 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I guess I don’t know what t hat m eans .
fe016 [ s] : and act ually I should say t his is what Don has b uh , he ’s
already been really helpful in , uh , chopping up t hese [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : So [ disfm arker] so first of all you [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fh|s] : um , I m ean , for t he SRI front − end , we really need t o
chop t hings up int o pieces t hat are f not t oo huge .

fe016 [ fh|s] : Um , but second of all , uh [ disfm arker] in general
because som e of t hese channels ,
fe016 [ s.%−−] : I ’d say , like , I don’t know , at least half of t hem
probably [ com m ent ] on average are g are ha are [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ %−−] : hav e a lot of cross − t a
fe016 [ s^ bsc] : sorry , som e of t he segm ent s have a lot of cross − t alk
.
fe016 [ fh|s] : Um , it ’s good t o get sort of short segm ent s if you ’re
gonna do recognit ion ,
fe016 [ s^ e] : especially forced alignm ent .
fe016 [ fh] : So ,
fe016 [ s] : uh , Don has been t aking a first st ab act ually using Jane ’s
first [ disfm arker] t he fir t he m eet ing t hat Jane t ranscribed
fe016 [ s] : which we did have som e problem s wit h ,
fe016 [ s] : and Thilo , uh , I t hink t old m e why t his was ,
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : but t hat people were swit ching m icrophones around
[ com m ent ] in t he very beginning ,
fe016 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ %−] : t he SRI re
m n014 [ s^ ar|s^ ng] : No , t h Yeah . No . They [ disfm arker] t hey were
not swit ching t hem but what t hey were [ disfm arker] t hey were
adjust ing t hem ,
fe016 [ %−] : and t hey [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ %−] : They were not [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ b] : Mm m .
m e011 [ s^ m ] : Adjust ing . Oh .
m n014 [ fh] : so .
fe016 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s] : And aft aft er a m inut e or so it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s way
bet t er .
m n014 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fg|s] : So we have t o sort of norm alize [ com m ent ] t he front −
end and so fort h , and have t hese sm all segm ent s .
m n014 [ b] : Yep .
fe016 [ s] : So we ’ve t aken t hat and chopped it int o pieces based
always on your [ disfm arker] your , um , cut s t hat you m ade on t he
m ix ed signal .
fe016 [ s] : And so t hat every [ disfm arker] every speaker has t he sam e
cut s .
fe016 [ s] : And if t hey have speech in it we run it t hrough .
fe016 [ s] : And if t hey don’t have speech in it we don’t run it t hrough .
fe016 [ s] : And we base t hat knowledge on t he t ranscript ion .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : On [ disfm arker] Just on t he m arks .
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
fe016 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um , t he problem is if we have no t im e m arks ,

fe016 [ s] : t hen for forced alignm ent we act ually don’t know where
[ disfm arker] you know , in t he signal t he t ranscriber heard t hat word .
fe016 [ fh] : And so [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see ,
m e011 [ s^ bs] : it ’s for t he lengt h .
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , if [ disfm arker] if it ’s a whole conversat ion and we
get a long , uh , you know , par paragraph of [ disfm arker] of t alk ,
m e011 [ s^ bk] : I see .
fe016 [ s^ no] : uh , I don’t know how t hey do t his .
fe016 [ fh|s^ no] : Um , we act ually don’t know which piece goes where .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : I underst and .
fe016 [ fh|s.%−] : And , um , I t hink wit h [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu] : Well you would need t o [ disfm arker] like a forced
alignm ent before y ou did t he chopping ,
m e018 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe016 [ s^ ar|s^ ng.%−−] : No , we used t he fact t hat [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : So when Jane t ranscribes t hem t he way she has
t ranscribers doing t his ,
m e011 [ s^ 2] : It ’s already chunked .
fe016 [ s] : whet her it ’s wit h t he pre − segm ent at ion or not ,
fe016 [ s] : t hey have a chunk and t hen t hey t ranscribes [ com m ent ]
t he words in t he chunk .
fe016 [ s] : And m aybe t hey choose t he chunk or now t hey use a pre −
segm ent at ion and t hen correct it if necessary .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : But t here ’s first a chunk and t hen a t ranscript ion .
fe016 [ s] : Then a chunk , t hen a t ranscript ion .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : That ’s great ,
fe016 [ s^ df.%−] : cuz t he recognizer can [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Uh , it ’s all pret t y good sized for t he recognizer also .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : Right , and it [ disfm arker] it helps t hat it ’s m ade
based on sort of heurist ics and hum an ear I t hink .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Good .
fe008 [ b] : Oh good .
fe016 [ s] : Th − but t here ’s going t o be a real problem ,
fe016 [ s] : uh , ev en if we chop up based on speech silence t hese , uh
, t he t ranscript s from I B M , we don’t act ually know where t he words
were ,
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ e] : which segm ent t hey belonged t o .
fe016 [ s] : So t hat ’s sort of what I ’m [ pause] worried about right now .
m e018 [ qw] : Why not do a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a forced
alignm ent ?
m e011 [ s^ nd] : That ’s what she ’s saying , is t hat you can’t .
fe016 [ s.%−] : If y ou do a forced alignm ent on som et hing really
[ disfm arker]

m e011 [ s^ 2.%−] : Got uh six sixt y m inut es of [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : well even if you do it on som et hing really long you need
t o know [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : you can always chop it up
fe016 [ s] : but y ou need t o have a reference of which words went wit h
which , uh , chop .
fe008 [ s^ bu] : Now wasn’t [ disfm arker] I t hought t hat one of t he
proposals was t hat IBM was going t o do an init ial forced alignm ent ,
fe016 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ e.%−] : aft er t hey [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aap.%−] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ am ] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat t hey are ,
m e011 [ s^ co] : We ’ll have t o t alk t o Brian .
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ s^ aa] : yeah , I ’m sure t hey will
m e013 [ s^ co] : and so we [ disfm arker] we have t o have a dialogue
wit h t hem about it .
fe016 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , it sounds like Liz has som e concerns
fe016 [ s.%−−] : May be t hey have som e [ disfm arker] you know , m aybe
act ually t here is som e , even if t hey ’re not fine grained , m aybe t he
t ranscribers [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fh|s] : uh , I don’t know , m aybe it ’s saved out in pieces or
[ disfm arker] or som et hing . That would help .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ fh] : But ,
fe016 [ s^ no] : uh , it ’s just an unknown right now .
fe008 [ fg|s^ cc] : Yeah . I [ disfm arker] I need t o [ disfm arker] t o writ e t o
him .
fe016 [ fh] : So .
fe008 [ s^ df] : I just [ disfm arker] you know , it ’s like I got over − t axed
wit h t he t im ing .
fe016 [ fg|s] : Right . But t he [ disfm arker] it is t rue t hat t he segm ent s
[ disfm arker] I haven’t t ried t he segm ent s t hat Thilo gave you
fe016 [ s^ ba] : but t he segm ent s t hat in your first m eet ing are great .
fe008 [ fh] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ ba^ e] : I m ean , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a good lengt h .
fe008 [ s^ bk^ m ] : A good size .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Good .
fe016 [ fg|%−] : Right , cuz [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ cs] : Well , I [ disfm arker] I was t hinking it would be fun t o
[ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker] uh , uh , if [ disfm arker] if you [ disfm arker]
wouldn’t m ind , [ com m ent ] [ vocalsound] t o give us a pre −
segm ent at ion .
fe016 [ b] : y yeah .

m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : Uh , m aybe you hav e one already of t hat first m of t he
m eet ing t hat uh , t he first t ranscribed m eet ing ,
fe008 [ s] : t he one t hat I t ranscribed .
fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : Do you have a [ disfm arker] could you generat e a pre −
segm ent at ion ?
m n014 [ h|s] : Um , I ’m sure I have som e
m e011 [ s] : February sixt eent h I t hink .
m n014 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] but t hat ’s t he one where we ’re , um , t rai
t raining on ,
m n014 [ s.%−−] : so t hat ’s a lit t le bit [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Oh , darn .
m n014 [ s^ r.%−] : It ’s a lit t le bit at odd t o [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Of course , of course , of course .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , OK .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs.%−−] : And act ually as you get t ranscript s just , um , for
new m eet ings , [ com m ent ] um , we can t ry [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe016 [ fh|s] : I m ean , t he [ disfm arker] t he m ore dat a we have t o t ry
t he [ disfm arker] t he alignm ent s on , um , t he bet t er .
fe016 [ s] : So it ’d be good for [ disfm arker] just t o know as
t ranscript ions are com ing t hrough t he pipeline from t he t ranscribers ,
fe016 [ s^ cs] : just t o sort of [ disfm arker] we ’re playing around wit h
sort of uh , param et ers f on t he recognizer ,
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : cuz t hat would be helpful .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Ex cellent , good .
fe016 [ s] : Especially as you get , en m ore voices .
fe016 [ s^ e] : The first m eet ing had I t hink just four people ,
m n014 [ s^ 2^ aa] : Four speakers ,
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : yeah .
fe008 [ s] : Yeah , Liz and I spoke d w at som e lengt h on Tuesday
fe016 [ b] : yeah .
fe008 [ s^ cc] : and [ disfm arker] and I [ disfm arker] and I was planning
t o do just a [ disfm arker] a prelim inary look over of t he t wo t hat are
finished and t hen give t hem t o you .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Oh , great ,
fe016 [ s^ bk^ r] : great .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : So .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : That ’s great .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I guess t he ot her t hing ,

m e013 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I can’t rem em ber if we discussed t his in t he
m eet ing but , uh , I know you and I t alked about t his a lit t le bit ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : t here was an issue of , uh ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : suppose we get in t he , uh ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : I guess it ’s enviable posit ion alt hough m aybe it ’s just
say ing where t he weak link is in t he chain ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : uh , where we [ disfm arker] we ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker] uh ,
m e013 [ s] : we have all t he dat a t ranscribed
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : and we have t hese t ranscribers
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and we were [ disfm arker] we ’re [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : we ’re st ill a bit slow on feeding [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : at t hat point we ’ve caught up
m e013 [ s] : and t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he , uh , t he weak
link is [ disfm arker] is recording m eet ings .
m e013 [ s^ f] : OK ,
m e013 [ h] : um ,
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : t wo quest ions com e , is y ou know what [ disfm arker]
how [ disfm arker] how do we [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : uh , it ’s not really a problem at t he m om ent cuz we haven’t
reached t hat point
m e013 [ qw] : but how do we st ep out t he recorded m eet ings ?
m e013 [ qy ] : And t he ot her one is , um , uh , is t here som e good use
t hat we can m ake of t he t ranscribers t o do ot her t hings ?
m e013 [ s] : So , um , I [ disfm arker] I can’t rem em ber how m uch we
t alked about t his in t his m eet ing
m e011 [ s] : We had spoken wit h t hem about it .
m e013 [ s.%−] : but t here was [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And t here is one use t hat [ disfm arker] t hat also we
discussed which was when , uh , Dave finishes t he [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ df] : and m aybe it ’s already finished [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] t he m odificat ion t o m ult i − t rans which will
allow fine grained encoding of overlaps .
fe008 [ s] : Uh , t hen it would be v ery [ disfm arker] t hese people would
be v ery good t o shift over t o finer grain encoding of overlaps .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : It ’s just a m at t er of , you know , providing [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So if right now you have t wo overlapping segm ent s in
t he sam e t im e
fe008 [ s] : bin , well wit h [ disfm arker] wit h t he im provem ent in t he
dat abase [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in t he , uh , sorry , in t he
int erface , it ’d be possible t o , um , you know , just do a click and drag
t hing , and get t he [ disfm arker] uh , t he specific place of each of t hose
, t he t im e t ag associat ed wit h t he beginning and end of [ disfm arker] of
each segm ent .

m e013 [ fg|s] : Right , so I t hink we t alking about t hree level
[ disfm arker] t hree t hings .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : One [ disfm arker] one was uh , we had s had som e
discussion in t he past about som e very high level labelings ,
fe008 [ s^ 2.%−] : The t ypes of overlaps [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m ] : t ypes of overlaps , and so fort h t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat som eone could do .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : Second was , uh , som ewhat lower level
m e013 [ s] : just doing t hese m ore precise t im ings .
m e013 [ s] : And t he t hird one is [ disfm arker] is , uh , just a com plet ely
wild hair brained idea t hat I have
m e013 [ s] : which is t hat , um , if , uh [ disfm arker] if we have t im e and
people are able t o do it , t o t ake som e subset of t he dat a and do
som e very fine grained analysis of t he speech .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : For inst ance , uh , m arking in som e overlapping
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : pot ent ially overlapping fashion , uh , t he value of , uh , ar
art iculat ory feat ures .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : You know , just sort of say , OK , it ’s voiced from here
t o here ,
m e013 [ s] : t here ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s nasal from here t o here , and so
fort h .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , as opposed t o doing phonet ic [ disfm arker] uh , you
know , phonem ic and t he phonet ic analysis ,
m e011 [ b.%] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ s] : and , uh , assum ing , uh , art iculat ory feat ure values for
t hose [ disfm arker] t hose t hings .
m e013 [ fh|s^ bd^ df] : Um , obv iously t hat ’s ext rem ely t im e −
consum ing .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : That would be really v aluable I t hink .
m e013 [ fh] : but , uh ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : we could do it on som e sm all subset .
fe008 [ s] : Also if y ou ’re dealing wit h consonant s t hat would be easier
t han vowels ,
fe008 [ qy^ g^ rt ] : wouldn’t it ?
fe008 [ s^ e] : I m ean , I would t hink t hat [ disfm arker] t hat , uh , being
able t o code t hat t here ’s a [ disfm arker] a fricat ive ext ending from
here t o here would be a lot easier t han classifying precisely which
v owel t hat was .
m e011 [ qw] : Which one .
fe016 [ b] : Mm m .

fe008 [ s] : I t hink v owels [ disfm arker] vowels are I t hink harder .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ am ] : Well , yeah ,
m e013 [ s^ arp^ ng] : but I t hink also it ’s just t he issue t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat when you look at t he [ disfm arker] u w u u when you
look at Swit chboard for inst ance v ery close up t here are places where
whet her it ’s a consonant or a v owel you st ill have t rouble calling it a
part icular phone
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m , OK .
m e011 [ fg|s.%−] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker] but just saying what t he
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : at t hat point
m e013 [ s^ df] : because it ’s [ disfm arker] you know , t here ’s t his
m ov em ent from here t o here
fe008 [ s^ na] : Yeah , I ’m sure .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Uh , y eah , I [ disfm arker] I know .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu] : You ’re saying r sort of rem ove t he high level
const raint s
m e013 [ %−] : so I
m e018 [ s^ bu^ e] : and go bot t om − up .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yep , just feat ures .
m e018 [ s.%−] : Then just say [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ cs] : Yeah , describe [ disfm arker] describe it .
fe016 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : Now I ’m suggest ing art iculat ory feat ures .
m e013 [ s] : May be t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s even a bet t er way t o
do it
m e013 [ s] : but it [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] but t hat ’s , you know ,
sort of a t radit ional way of describing t hese t hings ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : um , and [ disfm arker] uh ,
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s nice .
m e013 [ s.%−] : I m ean , act ually t his m ight be a g neat t hing t o t alk t o
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : Acoust ic feat ures v ersus psychological cat egories .
m e013 [ s^ aap] : Sort of .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , it ’s st ill [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : som e sort of cat egories
m e013 [ s^ cs] : but [ disfm arker] but som et hing t hat allows for
ov erlapping change of t hese t hings

m e013 [ s^ ba:s^ fe] : and t hen t his would give som e m ore ground work
for people who were building st at ist ical m odels t hat allowed for
ov erlapping changes , different t im ing changes as opposed t o just "
click ,
m e013 [ s] : you ’re now in t his st at e , which corresponds t o t his
speech sound " and so on .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m . Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ bu.%−−] : So t his is like gest ural [ disfm arker] uh , t hese g
m e013 [ s^ na] : Yeah , som et hing like t hat .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : I m ean , act ually if we get int o t hat it m ight be good t o
, uh , uh , haul John Ohala int o t his
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and ask his [ disfm arker] his views on it I t hink .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ fg] : Right .
fe016 [ qy ^ rt .%−−] : But is [ disfm arker] is t he goal t here t o have t his on
m eet ing dat a ,
fe008 [ b] : Excellent .
fe016 [ %−−] : like
fe016 [ qy^ bu^ rt ] : so t hat you can do far field st udies [ com m ent ] of
t hose gest ures
fe016 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker] um ,
fe016 [ qrr^ rt ] : or is it because you t hink t here ’s a different kind of
act ual product ion in m eet ings [ com m ent ] t hat people use ?
m e013 [ s] : No , I t hink [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] for
[ disfm arker] for [ disfm arker] for t hat purpose I ’m just viewing m eet ings
as being a [ disfm arker] a neat way t o get people t alking nat urally .
fe016 [ qrr.%−−] : Or [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s] : And t hen you have i and t hen [ disfm arker] and t hen it ’s
nat ural in all senses ,
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Just a source of dat a ?
fe016 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ s] : in t he sense t hat you have m icrophones t hat are at a
dist ance t hat y ou know , one m ight have ,
m e013 [ s] : and you have t he close m ikes ,
m e013 [ s] : and you have people t alking nat urally .
m e013 [ s] : And t he overlap is just indicat iv e of t he fact t hat people
are t alking nat urally ,
fe016 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So [ disfm arker] so I t hink t hat given t hat it ’s t hat kind
of corpus ,
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : if it ’s gonna be a very useful corpus
m e013 [ s:s] : um , if you say w OK , we ’v e lim it ed t he use by som e of
our , uh , uh , censored choices ,
m e013 [ s] : we don’t have t he video , we don’t [ disfm arker] and so
fort h ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : but t here ’s a lot of use t hat we could m ake of it by
ex panding t he annot at ion choices .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And , uh , m ost of t he t hings we ’ve t alked about hav e
been fairly high level ,
m e013 [ s] : and being kind of a bot t om − up person I t hought m aybe
we ’d , [ vocalsound] do som e of t he ot hers .
m e011 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : It ’s a nice balance .
fe016 [ fg|s^ ba] : Right . Yeah , t hat would be good .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That would be really nice t o offer t hose t hings wit h t hat
wide range .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah
m e013 [ s] : and hopefully som eone would m ake use of it .
fe008 [ s^ ba^ r] : Really nice .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , people didn’t [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : uh , I m ean , people have m ade a lot of use of [ disfm arker]
of TIMIT
m e013 [ s] : and , uh w due t o it s m arkings ,
m e013 [ s] : and t hen [ pause] t he Swit chboard t ranscript ion t hing ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : well I t hink has been very useful for a lot of people .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : That ’s t rue .
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ rt ^ t c] : I guess I want ed t o , um , sort of m ake a pit ch for
t ry ing t o collect m ore m eet ings .
fe008 [ b] : Cool .
fe016 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : I act ually I t alked t o Chuck Fillm ore
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : and I t hink t hey ’ve what , v ehem ent ly said no before
fe016 [ s:s^ co] : but t his t im e he wasn’t vehem ent and he said you

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : and t ry t o convince people " .
fe016 [ s] : So I ’m gonna [ pause] t ry . Go t o t heir m eet ing t om orrow
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : and see if we can t ry , uh , t o convince t hem

fe008 [ b] : Good .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : Cuz t hey have som et hing like t hree or four different
m eet ings ,
fe016 [ s.%−] : because t hey have [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : And t hey have very int erest ing m eet ings from t he point of
v iew of a v ery different t ype of [ disfm arker] of t alk t han we have here
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ s^ 2.%−] : Talk [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : and definit ely t han t he front end m eet ing , probably .
fe016 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : You m ean in t erm s of t he t opic [ disfm arker]
t opics ?
fe016 [ s^ aap|s^ rt ] : Well , yes and in t erm s of t he [ disfm arker] t he
fact t hat t hey ’re describing abst ract t hings
fe016 [ s] : and , uh , just dialogue − wise ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ f] : right .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : Um , so I ’ll t ry .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : And t hen t he ot her t hing is ,
fe016 [ s^ bd] : I don’t know if t his is at all useful ,
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : but I asked Lila if I can m ay be go around and t alk t o t he

m e013 [ b] : Yes .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : t o see if t here ’s any groups t hat , for a free lunch ,
fe016 [ s] : if we can st ill offer t hat ,
m e011 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : You m ean non − ICSI ?
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Great .
fe016 [ s.%−] : m ight be willing [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ m ^ na] : non − ICSI , non − academ ic ,
m e011 [ s^ am ] : Yeah , I guess you [ disfm arker] you can t ry
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : y ou know , like gov ernm ent people ,
m e011 [ %−] : but [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bd] : I don’t know .
m e011 [ s^ df] : The problem is so m uch of t heir st uff is confident ial .
fe016 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ s^ ng] : It would be very hard for t hem .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : Also it does seem like it t akes us way out of t he

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Is [ disfm arker] is it in t hese depart m ent s ?
fe008 [ s] : I m ean , it seem s like we [ disfm arker] we had t his idea
before of having like linguist ics st udent s brought down for free lunches

m e011 [ s^ df] : Well , t ha I t hink t hat ’s her point .
fe016 [ fg|s^ cs] : Right , and t hen we could also [ disfm arker] we m ight
t ry adv ert ising again
fe008 [ s^ ba] : and t hat ’s a nice idea .
fe016 [ s^ df] : because I t hink it ’d be good if [ disfm arker] if we can get
a few different sort of non − int ernal t ypes of m eet ings
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ e] : and just also m ore dat a .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s.%−] : And I t hink , uh , if we could get [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Does [ disfm arker] does John Ohala have weekly
phonet ics lab m eet ings ?
fe016 [ fh] : So .
fe016 [ s] : So I act ually wrot e t o him and he answered , " great , t hat
sounds really int erest ing " .
fe016 [ s] : But I nev er heard back
fe016 [ s] : because we didn’t act ually adv ert ise openly .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : We a I m ean w
fe016 [ s] : I t old [ disfm arker] I d asked him privat ely .
fe016 [ s] : Um , and it is a lit t le bit of a t rek for cam pus [ pause] folks .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : You m ight give t hem a free lunch .
m e011 [ fg] : But , um ,
fe016 [ fh|s.%−] : Um , so it ’s st ill wort hwhile .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : it would be nice if we got som eone ot her t han m e who
knew how t o set it up and could do t he recording
fe016 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : so u I didn’t have t o do it each t im e .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Exact ly ,
fe008 [ b] : Yeah . That ’s right .
fe016 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−] : and I was t hinking [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : He − he ’s supposed [ disfm arker] he ’s supposed t o be
t rained [ vocalsound] t o do it .
fe016 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : Plus we could also get you know , a s a st udent .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ co^ j] : OK , nex t week [ pause] you ’re going t o do it all
.
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : And I ’m willing t o t ry t o learn .
fe016 [ s^ bd] : I m ean , I ’m [ disfm arker] I would do m y best .
fe016 [ s] : Um , t he ot her t hing is t hat [ disfm arker] t here was a
num ber of t hings at t he t ranscript ion side t hat , um , t ranscribers can
do , like dialogue act t agging ,

m e011 [ s^ ba^ na] : It ’s not t hat hard .
fe016 [ s] : disfluency t agging ,
fe016 [ s] : um , t hings t hat are in t he speech t hat are act ually
som et hing we ’re y [ com m ent ] working on for language m odeling .
fe016 [ s] : And Mari ’s also int erest ed in it ,
fe016 [ s] : Andreas as well .
fe016 [ s] : So if y ou wanna process a ut t erance and t he first t hing t hey

t ag .
fe016 [ s] : Uh , and t hings like t hat ,
fe016 [ fh] : um ,
fe008 [ s] : Of course som e of t hat can be li done lexically .
fe016 [ %−] : t h
fe008 [ s] : And I also [ disfm arker] t hey are doing disfluency t agging t o
som e degree already .
fe016 [ s.%−] : A lot of it can be done [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ ba|s.%−−] : Great . So a [ disfm arker] a lot of t his kind of
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : I t hink t here ’s a second pass
fe016 [ s] : and I don’t really know what would exist in it .

by , uh [ disfm arker] by any room acoust ics
m e013 [ qrr] : or is it just [ disfm arker] uh , given t hat it ’s close it ’s not
a problem ?
m e013 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : It doesn’t seem like big room acoust ics problem s t o m y ear
fe016 [ s^ df] : but I ’m not an expert .
m e013 [ s^ bk|%−] : OK , so it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : It seem s like a problem wit h cross − t alk .
m e011 [ s^ nd] : e I bet wit h t he lapel m ike t here ’s plent y , uh , room
acoust ic
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fh|s^ aap] : but I I t hink t he rest is cross − t alk .
fe016 [ s^ na] : That [ disfm arker] t hat m ay be t rue .
fe016 [ s^ no] : But I don’t know how good it can get eit her by t hose
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t hose m et hods [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : That ’s t rue .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : So I [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s just ,
m e013 [ b] : OK .
fe016 [ s^ no] : Oh , I don’t know .
m e011 [ s^ na] : y eah , what you said , cross − t alk .
fe016 [ s^ bs] : All I m eant is just t hat as sort of [ disfm arker] as t his
pipeline of research is going on we ’re also experim ent ing wit h
different ASR , uh , t echniques .
m e011 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : And so it ’d be w good t o know about it .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : So t he problem is like , uh , on t he m icrophone of
som ebody who ’s not t alking t hey ’re picking up signals from ot her
people [ com m ent ] and t hat ’s [ v ocalsound] causing problem s ?
fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : R right , alt hough if t hey ’re not t alking , using t he
[ disfm arker] t he inhouse t ranscript ions , were sort of O K
fe016 [ s^ df] : because t he t no one t ranscribed any words t here
fe016 [ s] : and we t hrow it out .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : But if t hey ’re t alking at all and t hey ’re not t alking t he
whole t im e ,
fe016 [ s:s] : so y ou get som e speech and t hen a " m m − hm m " , and
som e m ore speech ,
fe016 [ s^ e] : so t hat whole t hing is one chunk .
fe016 [ s] : And t he person in t he m iddle who said only a lit t le bit is
picking up t he speech around it ,

fe016 [ s] : t hat ’s where it ’s a big problem .
fe008 [ s] : You know , t his does like seem like it would relat e t o som e
of what Jose ’s been working on as well ,
fe008 [ s.%−] : t he encoding of t he [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−] : And [ disfm arker] and he also , he was [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ 2] : The energy ,
m n005 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yeah ,
fe016 [ s^ aa] : right . Exact ly .
m n005 [ s^ m ] : energy .
fe008 [ s] : I was t I was t rying t o rem em ber , you have t his int erface
where y ou [ disfm arker] i you ha you showed us one t im e on your
lapt op
fe008 [ s] : t hat you [ disfm arker] y ou had different visual displays as
speech and nonspeech event s .
m n005 [ fg] : Yeah ,
m n005 [ s] : c Yeah . May [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I only display t he
different colors for t he different sit uat ion .
m n005 [ s] : But , eh , for m e and for m y problem s , is uh [ disfm arker] is
enough .
m n005 [ s^ df] : Because , eh , it ’s possible , eh , eh , in a sim p sam ple
v iew , uh , t o , nnn , t o com pare wit h c wit h t he segm ent , t he
[ disfm arker] t he kind of assessm ent
m n005 [ s] : what happened wit h t he [ disfm arker] t he different
param et ers .
m n005 [ fh|s.%−−] : And only wit h a different bands of color for t he , uh ,
few sit uat ion , eh , I consider for acoust ic event is enough t o @ @ .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] I see t hat , eh ,
y ou are considering now , eh , a v ery sophist icat ed , eh , ehm , eh , @
@ [ com m ent ] set of , eh , graphic s eh , eh , ehm , si sym bols t o
[ disfm arker] t o t ranscribe .
m n005 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : No ?
fe008 [ s.%−] : Oh , I w Uh − huh .
m n005 [ s^ bu] : Because , uh , before , you [ disfm arker] you are
t alking about t he [ disfm arker] t he possibilit y t o include in t he
Transcriber program eh , um , a set of sym bols , of graphic sym bol t o
[ disfm arker] t t o m ark t he different sit uat ions during t he t ranscript ion
m n005 [ s^ r] : during t he t ranscript ion .
m n005 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : No ?
fe008 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Well , you ’re say ing [ disfm arker] So , uh ,
sy m bols for differences bet ween laugh , and sigh , and [ disfm arker]
and [ disfm arker] and slam t he door and st uff ?
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ qrr] : Or som e ot her kind of t hing ?

m n005 [ s] : Yeah , y eah . The s t he sym bols , you [ disfm arker] you t alk
of before .
m n005 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : No ?
m n005 [ s^ e.%−] : To [ disfm arker] t o m ark [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ nd] : Well , I wouldn’t say [ vocalsound] sym bols so m uch .
fe008 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he m ain change t hat I [ disfm arker] t hat I
see in t he int erface is [ disfm arker] is just t hat we ’ll be able t o m ore
finely c uh , t im e t hings .
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : But I [ disfm arker] I also st t here was anot her aspect of your
work t hat I was t hinking about when I was t alking t o you
fe008 [ s.%−−] : which is t hat it sounded t o m e , Liz , as t hough you
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s] : and , uh , m aybe I didn’t q underst and t his ,
fe008 [ s^ bu] : but it sounded t o m e as t hough part of t he analysis
t hat y ou ’re doing involves t aking segm ent s which are of a part icular
t y pe and put t ing t hem t oget her .
fe008 [ s^ bu^ e] : And t h so if you hav e like a p a s you know , speech
from one speaker , [ pause] t hen you cut out t he part t hat ’s not t hat
speaker ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ bu^ e] : and you com bine segm ent s from [ pause] t hat sam e
speaker t o [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] and run t hem t hrough t he
recognizer .
fe008 [ qy^ bu^ g^ rt ] : Is t hat [ pause] right ?
fe016 [ s] : Well we t ry t o find as close of st art and end t im e of
[ disfm arker] as we can t o t he speech from an individual speaker ,
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ df.%−−] : because t hen we [ disfm arker] we ’re m ore
guarant eed t hat t he recognizer will [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : for t he forced alignm ent which is just t o give us t he t im e
boundaries ,
fe016 [ s] : because from t hose t im e boundaries t hen t he plan is t o
com put e prosodic feat ures .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : And t he sort of m ore space you have t hat isn’t t he t hing
y ou ’re t ry ing t o align t he m ore errors we have .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um , so , you know , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
[ disfm arker] it would help t o have eit her pre − processing of a signal
t hat creat es v ery good signal − t o − noise rat io ,
fe008 [ %−] : Cuz i
fe008 [ b] : OK .

fe016 [ s^ no] : which I don’t know how possible t his is for t he lapel ,
fe016 [ fh|s] : um , or t o have very [ disfm arker] t o have closer ,
[ v ocalsound] um , t im e [ disfm arker] you know , synch t im es , basically ,
around t he speech
fe016 [ s] : t hat get s t ranscribed in it , or bot h .
fe016 [ s] : And it ’s just sort of a open world right now of exploring t hat
.
fe016 [ s^ ba] : So I just want ed t o [ pause] see , you know , on t he
t ranscribing end from here t hings look good .
fe016 [ fh|s] : Uh , t he IBM one is m ore [ disfm arker] it ’s an open
quest ion right now .
fe016 [ s] : And t hen t he issue of like global processing of som e signal
fe016 [ s] : and t hen , you know , before we chop it up is [ disfm arker] is
y et anot her way we can im prove t hings in t hat .
m e018 [ qw^ cs] : What about increasing t he flexibilit y of t he alignm ent
?
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Do you rem em ber t hat t hing t hat Michael Finka did ?
m e018 [ qy ^ e^ rt ] : t hat experim ent he did a while back ?
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ fg|s^ cs.%−−] : Right . You can , um [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fh] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : The problem is just t hat t he acoust ic [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : when t he signal − t o − noise rat io is t oo low , um , you
[ disfm arker] you ’ll get , a uh [ disfm arker] an alignm ent wit h t he wrong
durat ion pat t ern
m e018 [ s^ bu] : Oh , so t hat ’s t he problem , is t he [ disfm arker] t he
signal − t o − noise rat io .
fe016 [ %−] : or it [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ na.%−−] : Yeah . It ’s not t he fact t hat you have like
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , what he did is allow you t o have , uh , words t hat
were in anot her segm ent m ove over t o t he [ disfm arker] at t he edges
of [ disfm arker] of segm ent at ions .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ 2] : Or even words insert ed t hat weren’t [ disfm arker]
weren’t t here .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : Right , t hings [ disfm arker] t hings near t he
boundaries where if y ou got your alignm ent wrong [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : cuz what t hey had done t here is align and t hen chop .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ fh|s] : Um , and t his problem is a lit t le bit j m ore global .
fe016 [ s^ e] : It ’s t hat t here are problem s even in inside t he
alignm ent s ,

fe016 [ fh|s] : uh , because of t he fact t hat t here ’s enough acoust ic
signal t here t for t he recognizer t o [ disfm arker] t o eat , [ vocalsound]
as part of a word .
fe016 [ s] : And it t ends t o do t hat .
fe016 [ %−] : S
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ fh] : So , uh ,
fe016 [ s] : but we probably will have t o do som et hing like t hat in
addit ion .
fe016 [ fh|s^ bs] : Anyway . So , yeah , bot t om [ disfm arker] bot t om line
is just I want ed t o m ake sure I can be aware of whoever ’s working on
t hese signal − processing t echniques for , uh , det ect ing energies ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ df] : because t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’ll really help us .
m e013 [ fg] : O K ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh
m e013 [ s^ cs] : t ea has st art ed out t here I suggest we c run t hrough
our digit s
m e013 [ fh] : and ,
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ %−−] : Uh ,
m e013 [ fg] : So ,
m e013 [ s^ t ] : OK , we ’re done .
