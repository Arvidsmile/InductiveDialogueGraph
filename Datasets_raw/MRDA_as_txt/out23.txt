m e011 [ s.%] : you know .
m n017 [ b.%] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ qy^ rt ] : Since , uh [ disfm arker] since I have t o leave as usual
at t hree − t hirt y , can we do t he int erest ing st uff first ?
fe008 [ s^ br^ j^ rt ] : I beg your pardon ?
m e013 [ fh] : Well [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ qw.%−] : Which is [ disfm arker] ?

m e011 [ qw] : What ’s t he int erest ing st uff ?
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ co] : Yeah . Th − now you get t o t ell us what ’s t he

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ co] : Please specify .
m e013 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ h|s^ t ] : Well , uh , I guess t he work t hat ’s been [ pause] done
on segm ent at ion would be m ost [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ na] : I t hink t hat would be a good t hing t o st art wit h .
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um , and , um , [ v ocalsound] t he ot her t hing , uh ,

m e013 [ s.%−−] : which I ’ll just say very briefly t hat m aybe relat es t o t hat
a lit t le bit ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : which is t hat , um ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh , one of t he suggest ions t hat cam e up in a brief
m eet ing I had t he ot her day when I was in Spain
m e013 [ s^ e] : wit h , uh , Manolo Pardo and [ vocalsound] Javier , uh ,
Ferreiros , who was [ pause] here before ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : was , um , why not st art wit h what t hey had before but
add in t he non − silence boundaries .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : So , in what Javier did before when t hey were doing ,
um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : h he was looking for , uh , speaker change [ pause] point s
.
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ s] : As a sim plificat ion , he originally did t his only using [ pause]
silence as , uh , a [ pause] put at ive , uh , speaker change point .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : And , uh , he did not , say , look at point s where you
were changing broad sp uh , phonet ic class , for inst ance .
m e013 [ s] : And for Broadcast News , t hat was fine .
m e013 [ s] : Here obviously it ’s not .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : And , um , so one of t he t hings t hat t hey were
pushing in d in discussing wit h m e is , um ,
m e013 [ s:qw] : w why are you spending so m uch t im e , uh , on t he , uh
, feat ure issue ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh , when perhaps if you sort of deal wit h what you were
using before
m n005 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : and t hen just broadened it a bit , inst ead of just t a using
silence as put at iv e change point also [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s] : So t hen you ’ve got [ disfm arker] you already have t he
super − st ruct ure wit h Gaussians and H − y ou know , sim ple H M Ms and
so fort h .
m n005 [ b.%] : Nnn , yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : And y ou [ disfm arker] you m ight [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So t here was a [ disfm arker] t here was a lit t le bit of a
[ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a difference of opinion
m e013 [ s^ df] : because I [ disfm arker] I t hought t hat it was
[ disfm arker] it ’s int erest ing t o look at what feat ures are useful .
m n005 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : But , uh , on t he ot her hand I saw t hat t he [ disfm arker]
t hey had a good point
m e013 [ s^ cs] : t hat , uh , if we had som et hing t hat worked for m any
cases before , m aybe st art ing from t here a lit t le bit [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s^ df] : Because ult im at ely we ’re gonna end up [ vocalsound]
wit h som e s su kind of st ruct ure like t hat ,
m n005 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : where y ou have som e kind of sim ple HMM
m e013 [ s] : and y ou ’re t est ing t he hypot hesis t hat , [ vocalsound] uh ,
t here is a change .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : so any way , I just [ disfm arker] report ing t hat .
m e013 [ fh] : But , uh , uh [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ qh^ t ^ t c] : So . Yeah , why don’t we do t he speech −
nonspeech discussion ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ qy .%−−] : Do [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I hear [ disfm arker] you
[ disfm arker] you didn’t [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Speech − nonspeech ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Uh − huh .
m n014 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n014 [ h|s^ rt ] : Um , so , uh , what we basically did so far was using
t he m ixed file t o [ disfm arker] t o det ect s speech or nonspeech [ pause]
port ions in t hat .
m e013 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ fh|s^ rt ] : And what I did so far is I just used our old Munich
sy st em ,
m n014 [ s^ e^ rt ] : which is an HMM − ba based syst em wit h Gaussian
m ix t ures for s speech and nonspeech .
m n014 [ s] : And it was a syst em which used only one Gaussian for
silence and one Gaussian for speech .
m n014 [ s] : And now I added , uh , m ult i − m ixt ure possibilit y for
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] for speech and nonspeech .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ s.%−−] : And I did som e t raining on [ disfm arker] on one
dialogue , which was t ranscribed by [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s] : Yeah . We [ disfm arker] we did a nons s speech −
nonspeech t ranscript ion .
m n005 [ s^ 2] : Jose .
m n014 [ s^ e] : Adam , Dave , and I , we did ,
m n014 [ s^ e] : for t hat dialogue
m n014 [ s] : and I t rained it on t hat .
m n014 [ s] : And I did som e pre − segm ent at ions for [ disfm arker] for
Jane .
m n014 [ s] : And I ’m not sure how good t hey are or what [ disfm arker]
what t he t ranscribers say .

m n014 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : They [ disfm arker] t hey can use it
m n014 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
fe008 [ s^ na] : Uh , t hey [ disfm arker] t hey t hink it ’s a t errific
im provem ent .
fe008 [ fh|s] : And , um , it real it just m akes a [ disfm arker] a world of
difference .
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ fh|s] : And , um , y you also did som e som et hing in addit ion
fe008 [ s] : which was , um , for t hose in which t here [ nonvocalsound]
was , uh , quiet speakers in t he m ix .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Uh , yeah .
m n014 [ s^ na] : That [ disfm arker] t hat was one [ disfm arker] one
[ disfm arker] one t hing ,
m n014 [ h|s] : uh , why I added m ore m ix t ures for [ disfm arker] for t he
speech .
m n014 [ s] : So I saw t hat t here were loud [ disfm arker] loudly speaking
speakers and quiet ly speaking speakers .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ s] : And so I did t wo m ixt ures , one for t he loud speakers and
one for t he quiet speakers .
m e011 [ qy^ rt ] : And did you hand − label who was loud and who was
quiet ,
m n014 [ s] : I did t hat for [ disfm arker] for five m inut es of one dialogue
m e011 [ qrr.%−] : or did you just [ disfm arker] ?
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n014 [ s^ e] : and t hat was enough t o [ disfm arker] t o t rain t he
sy st em .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ qw.%−] : W What [ disfm arker] ?
m n014 [ s] : And so it [ disfm arker] it adapt s , uh , on [ disfm arker] while
running .
m n014 [ fh] : So .
m n017 [ qw] : What kind of , uh , front − end processing did you do ?
m n014 [ s^ am ] : Hopefully .
m n005 [ b] : OK .
m n014 [ s] : It ’s just our [ disfm arker] our old Munich , uh , loudness −
based spect rum
m n014 [ s] : on m el scale t went y [ disfm arker] t went y crit ical bands and
t hen loudness .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ s] : And four addit ional feat ures , which is energy , loudness ,
m odified loudness , and zero crossing rat e .
m n014 [ s] : So it ’s t went y − four [ disfm arker] t went y − four feat ures .
m e013 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ b] : Mm m .

fe008 [ s] : And y ou also provided m e wit h several different versions ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : which I com pared .
m n014 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n014 [ fg] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : And so y ou change [ nonv ocalsound] param et ers .
fe008 [ qw.%−] : What [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : do y ou wanna say som et hing about t he param et ers
[ nonv ocalsound] t hat you change ?
m n014 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ na] : You can specify [ vocalsound] t he m inim um lengt h of
speech or [ disfm arker] and silence port ions which you want .
m n014 [ s^ df] : And so I did som e [ disfm arker] som e m odificat ions in
t hose param et ers ,
m n014 [ s^ e] : basically changing t he m inim um [ disfm arker] m inim um
[ pause] lengt h for s for silence
m n014 [ s.%−−] : t o have , er
m n014 [ s.%−−] : t o have , um [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ fh] : yeah [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s] : t o hav e m ore or less , uh , silence port ions in insert ed .
m n014 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ fg|s^ bu] : Right . So t his would work well for , uh , pauses and
ut t erance boundaries and t hings like t hat .
m n005 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : But for overlap I im agine t hat doesn’t work at all ,
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : t hat you ’ll have plent y of s sect ions t hat are
[ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : That ’s it .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m , m m − hm m .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b.%] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : That ’s t rue .
m e013 [ fg] : Um [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ arp] : But [ nonvocalsound] it [ disfm arker] it saves so m uch
t im e [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he [ nonv ocalsound] t ranscribers
m e011 [ fg] : But [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
fe008 [ s^ e] : just enorm ous , enorm ous savings .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : That ’s great .
fe008 [ fh] : Fant ast ic .
m e013 [ fg|s^ t ] : Um , just qu one quickly , uh , st ill on t he feat ures .

m e013 [ fh|s] : So [ vocalsound] you hav e t hese t went y − four feat ures .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , a lot of t hem are spect ral feat ures .
m e013 [ qy ] : Is t here a [ disfm arker] a t ransform at ion , uh , like
principal com ponent s t ransform at ion or som et hing ?
m n014 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n014 [ s^ ar|s] : No . W w we [ disfm arker] originally we did t hat
m e011 [ s] : Yeah . It was IS t wo .
m e013 [ %−] : Just [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s.%−−] : but we saw , uh ,
m n014 [ s.%−−] : when we used it , uh , f for our close − t alking
m icrophone , which [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s.%−−] : y eah , for our [ disfm arker] for our recognizer in Munich
[ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s] : we saw t hat w it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not [ disfm arker] it ’s
not so necessary .
m n014 [ s^ df] : It [ disfm arker] it works as well f wit h [ disfm arker] wit h
[ disfm arker] wit hout , uh , a LDA or som et hing .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : OK . No , I was j [ pause] curious .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah , I don’t t hink it ’s a big deal for t his applicat ion ,
fe008 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ %−] : but [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] Yeah , it ’s a
[ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b.%] : Right .
fe008 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : OK . But t hen t here ’s anot her t hing t hat also Thilo ’s
inv olv ed wit h ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : which is , um [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ e] : OK , and [ disfm arker] and also Da − Dave Gelbart .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So t here ’s t his [ disfm arker] t his problem of [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : and w and [ disfm arker] so we had t his m eet ing .
fe008 [ s^ e] : Th − t he [ nonvocalsound] [ disfm arker] also Adam , before
t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] before y ou went away .
fe008 [ s^ e] : Uh we , um [ disfm arker] regarding t he represent at ion
[ nonv ocalsound] of overlaps ,
fe008 [ s] : because at present , [ nonv ocalsound] [ vocalsound] um ,
because [ nonvocalsound] of t he lim it at ions of [ vocalsound] t h t he
int erface we ’re using ,
fe008 [ s] : overlaps are , uh , not being [ nonvocalsound] encoded by
[ nonv ocalsound] t he t ranscribers in as com plet e [ nonvocalsound] and
, uh , det ailed a way as it m ight be ,
fe008 [ s] : and as m ight be desired [ disfm arker] I t hink would be
desired in t he corpus ult im at ely .

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : So we don’t have st art and end point s [ nonvocalsound] at
each point where t here ’s an overlap .
fe008 [ s] : We just have t he [ disfm arker] t he [ nonvocalsound] overlaps
[ nonv ocalsound] encoded in a sim ple bin .
fe008 [ fh|s^ cs] : Well , OK . So [ nonvocalsound] @ @ t he lim it s of t he
[ nonv ocalsound] over of [ disfm arker] of t he int erface are [ vocalsound]
such t hat we were [ disfm arker] at t his m eet ing we were ent ert aining
how we m ight eit her expand [ nonvocalsound] t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ v ocalsound] int erface or find ot her t ools which already [ pause] do
what would be useful .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Because what would ult im at ely be , um , ideal in m y
[ disfm arker] m y v iew
fe008 [ s.%−−] : and I t hink [ disfm arker] I m ean , I had t he sense t hat it
was consensus ,
fe008 [ s^ cs] : is t hat , um , a t horough − going m usical score not at ion
would be [ nonvocalsound] t he best way t o go .
fe008 [ s^ df] : Because [ nonvocalsound] you can have m ult iple
channels ,
fe008 [ s] : t here ’s a single t im e − line ,
fe008 [ s] : it ’s very clear , flex ible , and all t hose nice t hings .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ fh] : OK . So , um ,
fe008 [ s] : um , I spoke [ disfm arker] I had a m eet ing wit h Dave Gelbart
on [ disfm arker] on [ disfm arker] and he had , uh , excellent ideas on
how [ pause] t he int erface could be [ pause] m odified t o [ disfm arker] t o
do t his kind of represent at ion .
fe008 [ s] : But , um , he [ disfm arker] in t he m eant im e you were
checking int o t he ex ist ence of already , um , exist ing int erfaces which
m ight already have t hese propert ies .
fe008 [ fh|qy ] : So , do you wanna say som et hing about t hat ?
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m n014 [ fh|s^ rt ] : Um , I [ vocalsound] t alked wit h , uh , Munich guys
from [ disfm arker] from Ludwi − Ludwig Maxim ilians Universit y , who do a
lot of t ranscribing and t ranslit erat ions .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ s^ rt ] : And t hey basically said t hey have [ disfm arker] t hey
have , uh , a t ool t hey developed [ pause] t hem selves
m n014 [ s] : and t hey can’t give away , uh , f it ’s t oo error − prone ,
m n014 [ s^ e] : and had [ disfm arker] it ’s not support ed ,
m n014 [ %−−] : a a a and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ fh] : But , um ,
m n014 [ s] : Susanne Bur − Burger , who is at se CMU , he wa who was
form ally at [ disfm arker] in Munich and w and is now at [ disfm arker] wit h
CMU ,

m n014 [ s^ rt ] : she said she has som et hing
m n014 [ s] : which she uses t o do eight channels , uh , t rans
t ranslit erat ions ,
m n014 [ s^ e] : eight channels sim ult aneously ,
m e013 [ s^ fa^ t 3.%] : Excuse m e .
m n014 [ s^ e] : but it ’s running under Windows .
fe008 [ s^ m ] : Under Windows .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ s] : So I ’m not sure if [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] if we can use
it .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ s] : She said she would give it t o us .
m n014 [ s^ rt ] : It wouldn’t be a problem .
m n014 [ s] : And I ’v e got som e [ disfm arker] som e kind of m anual

m e011 [ s^ cs] : Well , m aybe we should get it
m e011 [ s] : and if it ’s good enough we ’ll arrange Windows m achines
t o be available .
m n014 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe008 [ fg|s^ am ] : Mm − hm m . We could [ disfm arker] uh , pot ent ially
[ nonv ocalsound] so .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I also want ed t o be sure [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , I ’ve [ disfm arker] I ’ve seen t he [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : In t erm s [ nonvocalsound] of it being [ nonvocalsound]
Windows [ nonvocalsound] versus [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ qy .%−−] : But I ’m just wondering , is [ disfm arker] ?
m e011 [ s^ ar|s] : No , no . Praat isn’t [ disfm arker] Praat ’s m ult i −
plat form .
m n014 [ s^ ar|s.%−] : No . No , Praat [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh ! I see .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bk^ r] : Oh , I see .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So Praat m ay not be [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ nd] : That ’s not Praat .
m n014 [ s:s] : It ’s called " t rans t ransedit " [ pause] I t hink .
fe008 [ s] : It ’s a different one .

fe008 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n014 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he , uh [ disfm arker] t he t ool from
[ disfm arker] from Susanne .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK . OK . Alright .
m e013 [ s^ t c.%−−] : The ot her t hing , uh , t o keep in m ind ,
m e013 [ fh|%−−] : uh [ disfm arker] I m ean ,
m e013 [ s] : we ’v e been very concerned t o get all t his rolling
m e013 [ s] : so t hat we would act ually have dat a ,
fe008 [ b] : Mm m , y eah .
m e013 [ s] : but , um , I t hink our out side sponsor is act ually gonna kick
in
fe008 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : and ult im at ely t hat pat h will be sm oot hed out .
m e013 [ s] : So I don’t know if we hav e a long − t erm need t o do lot s
and lot s of t ranscribing .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : I t hink we had a very quick need t o get som et hing out
m e013 [ s] : and we ’d like t o be able t o do som e lat er
m e013 [ s^ ba^ df] : because just it ’s int er it ’s int erest ing .
m e013 [ s] : But as far a you know , uh , wit h [ disfm arker] wit h any luck
we ’ll be able t o wind down t he larger project .
m e011 [ fg] : Oh .
m n017 [ %−] : But y ou s
m e011 [ s] : What our decision was is t hat [ pause] we ’ll go ahead wit h
what we hav e wit h a not very fine t im e scale on t he overlaps .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and do what we can lat er [ pause] t o
clean t hat up if we need t o .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ cs^ t c.%−−] : And [ disfm arker] and I was just t hinking t hat , um
, [ v ocalsound] if it were possible t o bring t hat in , like , [ vocalsound]
y ou know , t his week ,
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : t hen [ nonvocalsound] when t hey ’re encoding t he
ov erlaps [ nonvocalsound] it would be nice for t hem t o be able t o
specify when [ disfm arker] you know , t he st art point s and end point s of
ov erlaps .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : uh Th − t hey ’re [ nonv ocalsound] m aking really quick
progress .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : That ’s great .
fe008 [ fg|s] : And , um , so m y [ disfm arker] m y goal was [ disfm arker] w
m m y charge was t o get eleven hours by t he end of t he m ont h .

fe008 [ s] : And it ’ll be [ disfm arker] I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m [ disfm arker] I
’m clear t hat we ’ll be able t o do t hat .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : That ’s great .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ^ t c] : And did you , uh , forward Morgan Brian ’s [ pause]
t hing ?
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I sent [ nonvocalsound] it t o ,
fe008 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ qo^ t 1] : who did I send t hat t o ?
fe008 [ s] : I sent it t o a list
fe008 [ s] : and I t hought [ nonvocalsound] I sent it t o [ nonvocalsound]
t he [ nonv ocalsound] [ disfm arker] e t o t he local list .
m e018 [ s] : Meet ing Recorder .
m e011 [ qy ^ bh] : Oh , you did ?
fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : You saw t hat ?
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : OK . So you probably did get t hat .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So Brian did t ell [ nonvocalsound] m e t hat
[ nonv ocalsound] in fact what you said , t hat , [ nonvocalsound] uh
[ disfm arker] t hat [ nonvocalsound] our [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : t hat t hey are [ pause] m aking progress
fe008 [ s] : and t hat he ’s going [ disfm arker] t hat [ nonvocalsound] t hey
’re [ nonv ocalsound] going [ disfm arker] he ’s gonna check t he f t he
out put of t he first t ranscript ion
fe008 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , basically it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s all t he difference in
t he world .
fe008 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , basically he ’s [ disfm arker] he ’s on it now .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Oh , t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so [ disfm arker] so t his is [ disfm arker] so i
it ’ll happen .
fe008 [ s] : t his is a new developm ent .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Super .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Super .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK . Great .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Yeah . I m ean , basically it ’s just saying t hat one of our
[ disfm arker] one of our best people is on it ,
m e013 [ s] : y ou know , who just doesn’t happen t o be here anym ore .
fe008 [ b^ rt ] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Som eone else pays him .
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ qy ^ bh] : Isn’t t hat great ?
m n017 [ s] : But about t he need for t ranscript ion ,

m n017 [ qy ^ bu^ df^ rt ] : I m ean , don’t we [ disfm arker] didn’t we
prev iously [ vocalsound] decide t hat t he [ pause] IBM [ pause]
t ranscript s would have t o be [ pause] checked anyway and possibly
augm ent ed ?
m e013 [ b] : So . [ v ocalsound] Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes . That ’s t rue .
m n017 [ s^ cs] : So , I t hink having a good t ool is wort h som et hing no
m at t er what .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : S OK . That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a good point .
m e011 [ fg|s^ t c] : Yeah , and Dave Gelbart did volunt eer ,
fe008 [ b] : Good .
m e011 [ s] : and since he ’s not here , I ’ll repeat it [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : t o at least m odify Transcriber ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : which , if we don’t have som et hing else t hat works , I
t hink t hat ’s a pret t y good way of going .
m n014 [ b] : Mm m .
fe008 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : And we discussed on som e m et hods t o do it .
m e011 [ s^ rt .%−−] : My approach originally ,
m e011 [ s.%−−] : and I ’ve already hacked on it a lit t le bit [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : it was t oo slow because I was t rying t o display all t he
wav eform s .
m e011 [ s] : But he point ed out t hat you don’t really have t o .
fe008 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : I t hink t hat ’s a good point .
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
m e011 [ s] : That if you just display t he m ix waveform and t hen have a
user int erface for edit ing t he different channels , t hat ’s perfect ly
sufficient .
fe008 [ fg] : Yeah , exact ly .
fe008 [ s] : And just keep t hose [ nonvocalsound] t hings separat e .
fe008 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and , um , Dan Ellis ’s hack already allows
t hem t o be [ nonv ocalsound] able t o display [ vocalsound] different
[ nonv ocalsound] waveform s t o clarify overlaps and t hings ,
fe008 [ s.%−] : so t hat ’s already [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ar|s] : No . They can only display one ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : but t hey can list en t o different ones .
fe008 [ s^ bk|%−] : Oh , yes , but [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : Well , [ vocalsound] uh , yes , but [ nonvocalsound] what I
m ean is [ pause] t hat , uh , from t he t ranscriber ’s [ nonvocalsound]
perspect ive , uh , t hose [ nonvocalsound] t wo funct ions are separat e .

fe008 [ s] : And Dan Ellis ’s hack handles t he , [ vocalsound] um , choice
[ nonv ocalsound] [ disfm arker] t he abilit y t o choose different waveform s
[ v ocalsound] from m om ent t o m om ent .
m e011 [ s^ ng] : But only t o list en t o ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : not t o look at .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ fg] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : The waveform you ’re looking at doesn’t change .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : That ’s t rue .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah ,
fe008 [ s^ bd] : but [ nonvocalsound] t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s OK ,
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : cuz t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re ,
fe008 [ s] : you know , t hey ’re focused on t he ear anyway .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−] : And t hen [ disfm arker] and t hen
fe008 [ s] : t he hack t o [ vocalsound] preserve t he overlaps
[ nonv ocalsound] bet t er would be one which creat es different out put
files for each channel ,
fe008 [ s] : which t hen [ nonvocalsound] would also serve Liz ’s request
[ pause] of hav ing ,
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : you know , a single channel ,
fe008 [ s] : separable , uh , cleanly , easily separable ,
m e013 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : uh , t ranscript t ied t o a single channel , uh , audio .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy ] : Hav e , uh , folks from NIST been in cont act wit h you ?
fe008 [ s] : Not direct ly .
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : I ’m t rying t o t hink if [ disfm arker] if I could have got t en it
ov er a list .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : I don’t [ disfm arker] I don’t t hink so .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ cs] : OK . Well , holidays m ay have int errupt ed t hings ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : cuz in [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : They [ v ocalsound] seem t o want t o [ pause] get absolut ely
clear on st andards for [ disfm arker] t ranscript ion st andards and so
fort h wit h [ disfm arker] wit h us .
fe008 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh ! This was from before Decem ber .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Right . Because t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re
presum ably going t o st art recording next m ont h .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK . OK .
m e013 [ fh] : So .

m e011 [ fg|s] : Oh , we should definit ely get wit h t hem t hen ,
m e011 [ fh] : and
m e011 [ s] : agree upon a form at .
m e011 [ s] : Though I don’t rem em ber em ail on t hat .
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : So was I not in t he loop on t hat ?
m e013 [ h|s^ na] : Um . Yeah , I don’t t hink I m ailed anybody .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I just t hink I t old t hem t o cont act Jane [ disfm arker] t hat
, uh , if t hey had a [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : That ’s right .
m e013 [ s] : if , uh [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat , uh , as t he point

m e013 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , I t hink t hat ’s right .
m e011 [ fh] : Just , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s] : So , y eah . Maybe I ’ll , uh , ping t hem a lit t le bit about it
t o [ v ocalsound] get t hat st raight .
fe008 [ fg] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : I ’m keeping t he convent ions [ pause] absolut ely [ pause] as
sim ple [ nonvocalsound] as possible .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : Yeah . So is it [ disfm arker] cuz wit h any luck t here ’ll
act ually be a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] t here ’ll be collect ions at
Colum bia ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : collect ions at [ disfm arker] at UW [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean Dan [ disfm arker] Dan is very int erest ed in doing
som e ot her t hings ,
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah . Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Well , I t hink it ’s im port ant bot h for t he not at ion and t he
m achine represent at ion t o be t he sam e .
m e013 [ s^ 2] : and collect ions at NIST .
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
fe008 [ s] : N t here was also t his , [ nonvocalsound] uh , em ail from Dan
regarding t he [ pause] speech − non nonspeech segm ent at ion t hing .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I don’t know if ,
fe008 [ fh] : uh ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : uh , we wanna ,
fe008 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]

fe008 [ s] : and Dan Gel − and Dave Gelbart is int erest ed in pursuing
t he aspect [ nonvocalsound] of using am plit ude [ nonvocalsound] as a
[ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] as a basis for t he separat ion
.
m e013 [ s.%−] : Oh , yeah . He was t alking [ disfm arker] he was t alking
[ disfm arker] I m ean , uh , we [ disfm arker] he had [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Cross − correlat ion .
fe008 [ %−] : Cross
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ m ] : Yeah , cross − correlat ion .
m n014 [ s^ 2.%−−] : Cross
m e013 [ s] : I had m ent ioned t his a couple t im es before , t he c t he
com m ercial devices t hat do , uh , [ vocalsound] uh , voice , uh
[ disfm arker] you know , act ive m iking ,
fe008 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : basically look at t he am p at t he energy at each of t he
m ikes .
m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and you basically com pare t he energy
here t o [ v ocalsound] som e funct ion of all of t he m ikes .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So ,
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : by doing t hat , you know , rat her t han set t ing any , uh ,
absolut e t hreshold , you act ually can do pret t y good , uh , select ion of
who [ disfm arker] who ’s t alking .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : And t hose [ disfm arker] t hose syst em s work very well , by
t he way ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , so people use t hem in [ v ocalsound] panel
discussions and so fort h wit h sound reinforcem ent differing in
[ disfm arker] in sort of ,
m n005 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and , uh , t hose [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ df] : Boy , t he guy I knew who built t hem , built t hem like
t went y [ disfm arker] t went y years ago ,
m e013 [ s^ ba] : so t hey ’re [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] it ’s [ disfm arker]
t he [ disfm arker] t he t echniques work pret t y well .
m e011 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ fg] : Fant ast ic .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
fe008 [ s] : Cuz t here is one t hing t hat we don’t have right now and t hat
is t he aut om at ic , um , channel ident ifier .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

fe008 [ s^ rt ] : That [ disfm arker] t hat , you know , t hat would g help in
t erm s of encoding of overlaps .
fe008 [ s^ df] : The [ disfm arker] t he t ranscribers would have less , uh ,
disent angling t o do [ pause] if t hat were available .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah . So I t hink , you know , basically you can look at
som e [ disfm arker] p you have t o play around a lit t le bit , uh , t o figure
out what t he right st at ist ic is ,
fe008 [ fh] : But .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : but y ou com pare each m icrophone t o som e st at ist ic based
on t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] on t he overall [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , and we also have t hese [ disfm arker] we have t he
advant age of having [ pause] dist ant m ikes t oo .
m e013 [ s.%−] : So t hat , you cou y o
m e011 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , alt hough t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ba^ bu] : using t he close − t alking I t hink would be m uch
bet t er .
m e011 [ qy^ g] : Wouldn’t it ?
fe008 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s^ no] : Um . I [ disfm arker] I don’t know .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I just [ disfm arker] it ’d be [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : If I was act ually working on it , I ’d sit t here and
[ disfm arker] and play around wit h it ,
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and get a feeling for it .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : But ,
m e013 [ s] : uh , you cert ainly wanna use t he close − t alking , as a
[ disfm arker] at least .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : I don’t know if t he ot her would [ disfm arker] would add
som e ot her helpful dim ension or not .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ fg|qw^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : OK . What [ disfm arker] what are t he different
, uh , classes t o [ disfm arker] t o code , uh , t he [ disfm arker] t he
ov erlap , you will use ?
fe008 [ h|%−−] : Um , t o code d
fe008 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : so t ypes of overlap ?
m n005 [ qw.%−−] : What you [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

fe008 [ s] : Um , so [ nonvocalsound] at a m eet ing t hat wasn’t
t ranscribed , we worked up a [ disfm arker] a t ypology .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−] : And , um [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : Look like , uh , you t you explaining in t he

m n005 [ %−] : The [ disfm arker] ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes , exact ly .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah ? Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : That hasn’t changed .
fe008 [ fh] : So
fe008 [ s] : it [ nonvocalsound] i t he [ disfm arker] it ’s basically a t wo −
t iered st ruct ure where t he first one is whet her [ nonvocalsound] t he
person who ’s int errupt ed cont inues or not .
fe008 [ s:qy ^ rt ] : And t hen below t hat t here ’re [ nonvocalsound]
subcat egories , uh , t hat have m ore t o do wit h , [ nonvocalsound] you
know , is it , [ v ocalsound] uh , sim ply [ nonvocalsound] backchannel
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s:qrr] : or is [ nonvocalsound] it , um , som eone com plet ing
som eone else ’s t hought ,
fe008 [ s:qrr] : or is it som eone in int roducing a new t hought .
m e011 [ fg] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : And I hope t hat if we do a forced alignm ent wit h t he close −

t he t im e inform at ion of when t he overlap occurred .
m n005 [ b] : Huh .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−] : Mm − hm m . Well , [ vocalsound] one would [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s^ m ] : We hope .
m e011 [ s^ bk|qr] : Yeah . Who knows ?
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’d be [ disfm arker] t hat ’d be nice .

[ disfm arker] I ’v e [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ qw] : So who ’s gonna do t hat ?
m n017 [ qw^ e] : Who ’s gonna do forced alignm ent ?
m e011 [ s] : Well , u uh , IBM was going t o .
m e011 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n005 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e011 [ s] : and I im agine t hey st ill plan t o

fe008 [ s^ df] : because I t hink people can raise quest ions [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : you know , i i t he t hey t hink about different t hings
m e011 [ s^ ba] : That ’s a good idea .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : and t hey t hink of different [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ fh] : and um ,
fe008 [ s] : I t rained t hem t o , uh , f on about a m inut e or t wo of t he
one t hat was already t ranscribed .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : This also gives m e a sense of [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : You know , I can [ disfm arker] I can use t hat lat er , wit h

fe008 [ s] : But t he m ain t hing was t o get t hem used t o t he

t h t h t he size of t he unit versus how long it t akes t o play it back

.
fe008 [ s] : They ’re , um [ disfm arker] t hey ’re t rained in linguist ics .
m e011 [ b] : Good .
fe008 [ s.%−] : They got [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e011 [ s^ fe] : Oh , no .
m e011 [ qy] : Is t hat good or bad ?
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well , t hey t hey ’re v ery perce
fe008 [ s:s] : t hey ’ll [ disfm arker] So one of t hem said " well , you know ,

fe008 [ s:s] : not really " and " ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s:qw] : so what [ vocalsound] [ disfm arker] what should I do wit h
t hat ? "
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−−:s.%−−] : And I said , " well for our purposes ,
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I do have a convent ion . If it ’s an [ disfm arker] a

fe008 [ s] : That one , I t hink we [ disfm arker] you know , wit h Eric ’s

m e013 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : But I t old t hem if [ disfm arker] if t here ’s an obvious

m e013 [ b] : Yes .
fe008 [ s] : and I gave m y [ disfm arker] m y exam ple , like I said , "
m icrofon " [ pause] in inst ead of " m icrophone " .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Didn’t bot her [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I knew it when I said it .
fe008 [ s:s] : I rem em ber s t hinking " oh , t hat ’s not correct ly

[ disfm arker] what you m ean .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : You ’ll self − repair .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : But I have a convent ion t hat if it ’s obviously a noncanonical

wi wit hin t he realm of resolut ion t hat you can t ell in t his nat ive English
[ disfm arker] Am erican English speaker , you know t hat I didn’t m ean t o

fe008 [ s] : Then you ’d put a lit t le t ick at t he beginning of t he word ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : and t hat just signals t hat , um , t his is not st andard ,
fe008 [ s:s] : and t hen in curly bracket s " pron [ nonvocalsound] error " .
fe008 [ fh|s] : And , um , and ot her t han t hat , it ’s w word level .

if we want ed t hem t o .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

fe008 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Oh , t hat ’d be so super .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : They would be so [ disfm arker] s so t errific .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , t his was som et hing t hat we were t alking about .

m e011 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e011 [ s] : One for each part icipant .
m e011 [ s^ cs.%−−] : So t hey could by hand [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aap] : Well , t hat ’s one way t o do it .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs^ ng] : But I ’ve been say ing t he ot her t hing is just go

m e013 [ s] : And so [ vocalsound] t hat hasn’t been really our focus .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , we can consider it .
m e013 [ s] : But , I m ean , t he ot her t hing is since we ’ve been

m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , so t he [ disfm arker] so t he argum ent is t hat if your
st at ist ical syst em is good [ vocalsound] it will in fact , uh , clean t hings
up .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f] : Right ?
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : So it it ’s got it s own object ive crit erion .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And , uh , so in principle you could st art up wit h
som et hing t hat was kind of rough [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , t o give an ex am ple of , um , som et hing we
used t o do , uh , at one point , uh , back [ disfm arker] back when
Chuck was here
m e013 [ s.%−−] : in early t im es ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : is we would t ake ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : um , [ vocalsound] da t ake a word and , uh , have a
canonical pronunciat ion
m e013 [ s] : and , uh , if t here was five phones in a word , [ vocalsound]
y ou ’d break up t he word , [ vocalsound] uh , int o five equal − lengt h
pieces
m e013 [ s] : which is com plet ely gross .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Wrong .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , t h t he t im ing is off [ pause] all over t he place in
just about any word .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ ba^ df^ rt ] : But it ’s O K .
m e013 [ s] : You st art off wit h t hat and t he st at ist ical syst em
m e013 [ s] : t hen aligns t hings ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : and event ually you get som et hing t hat doesn’t really
look t oo bad .

fe008 [ b] : Oh , ex cellent .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ bs] : So [ disfm arker] so I t hink using a [ disfm arker] a good
[ pause] aligner , um , act ually can [ disfm arker] can help a lot .
m e013 [ fh] : Um . [ vocalsound] But , uh ,
m e013 [ s] : y ou know , t hey bot h help each ot her .
m e013 [ s] : If you have a [ disfm arker] if you have a bet t er st art ing
point , t hen it helps t he aligner .
m e013 [ s] : If you have a good alignm ent , it helps t he , uh , t h t he
hum an in [ disfm arker] in t aking less t im e t o correct t hings .
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker] so [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ x ] : OK .
fe008 [ b.%] : Excellent .
fe008 [ s] : I guess t here ’s anot her aspect , t oo ,
fe008 [ s^ bd] : and I don’t know [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bd] : uh , t his [ disfm arker] t his is [ disfm arker] very possibly a

fe008 [ s] : But , [ nonv ocalsound] uh , just let m e say [ pause] wit h
reference t o t his idea of , um , [ vocalsound] higher − order organizat ion
wit hin m eet ings .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So like in a [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : y ou know , t he t opics t hat are covered during a m eet ing
wit h reference t o t he ot her , uh , uses of t he dat a ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : so being able t o [ pause] find where so − and − so t alked
about such − and − such ,
fe008 [ fh] : t hen , um , um [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : e I m ean , I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I did sort of a
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] a rough [ pause] pass [ nonvocalsound] on

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ e] : already t ranscribed m eet ing .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And I don’t know if , um [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : where [ nonvocalsound] t hat [ disfm arker] i if t hat ’s
som et hing t hat we wanna do wit h each m eet ing ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : sort of like a , um [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : it ’s like a m anifest , when you get a box full of st uff ,
m e013 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] or if t hat ’s , um [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I m ean , i I [ disfm arker] I don’t know what uh , level of det ail
would be m ost useful .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : I don’t know i if t hat ’s som et hing t hat [ pause] I should

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

fe008 [ s] : But t his issue of t he cont ent s of t he m eet ing
fe008 [ s] : in an out line form .
fe008 [ fh] : OK .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Meaning really isn’t m y t hing .
m e013 [ fg] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : I t hink it just [ disfm arker] whoever is int erest ed can do
t hat .
m e011 [ s^ cs^ df.%−−] : I m ean , so if som eone want s t o use t hat dat a
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : We , uh , uh , cou t rying t o [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : That ’s fine .
fe008 [ s] : I ’m finished .
m e013 [ s] : eh , was [ disfm arker] p Well , y ou know , t he t hing I ’m

m n005 [ s^ bk|qw^ rt ] : OK . What do y ou want ?
m e013 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ cs] : We could skip t he digit s .

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : That is t o say , use , you know , as [ disfm arker] as you

m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs^ e] : And , uh , t hen , uh , look at it m ore from t he aspect

m e013 [ s^ df] : Cuz again t he idea is t here [ disfm arker] t he lim it at ion
t here again was t hat he was [ disfm arker] he was only using it t o look

m n014 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Mm m , y eah .
m n014 [ s^ ng] : Yeah , but I ’m not t oo sure if [ disfm arker] if we can

m n005 [ fh] : Ah .
m n014 [ s] : it ’s only speech or it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s

m e011 [ s^ am ] : I t hink Javier ’s m ight be able t o .

m e011 [ s] : It doesn’t have t he sam e Gaus − uh , H M M m odeling ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .

m n014 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m e013 [ s^ arp] : Well , it ’s [ disfm arker] sort of has a sim ple one .
m n005 [ b] : Mm m ,

m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ %−] : It ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : Does it ?

m e013 [ qy ] : it ’s just [ disfm arker] it ’s just a [ disfm arker] isn’t it just a

m e011 [ s] : And t hen [ pause] he ch you choose opt im al split t ing .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d.%−] : Oh , it doesn’t have [ disfm arker] it doesn’t have

m e013 [ s.%−−] : I t hought it [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ nd] : Maybe I ’m m isrem em bering , but I did not t hink it had

m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .

m n014 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ s] : No , Javier di doesn’t worked wit h , uh , a Markov
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ na] : Yeah , I didn’t t hink so .
m n005 [ s.%−] : He on only t rain [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu.%−−] : Oh , OK . So he ’s just [ disfm arker] he just
com put es a Gaussian over pot ent ial [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m n005 [ s] : Yeah . It was only Gaussian .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see . I see .
m e013 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s] : This is t he idea .
m e011 [ s] : And so I [ disfm arker] I t hink it would work fine for det ect ing
ov erlap .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : It ’s just , uh , t hat i it [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.%−−] : he has t he t wo − pass issue t hat [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bs] : What he does is , as a first pass he [ disfm arker] he
[ disfm arker] p he does , um , a guess at where t he divisions m ight be
and he overest im at es .
m e011 [ s^ e] : And t hat ’s just a dat a reduct ion st ep ,
m e011 [ s] : so t hat y ou ’re not t rying at every t im e int erval .
m n014 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : OK .

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : OK .

m e011 [ s^ e] : wit h t he Meet ing Recorder .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : So if we used anot her m et hod t o get t he first pass , I

m e013 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : And t hen you have a Markov m odel for each ?
m n014 [ h] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ no] : I ’m not sure .
m n014 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I t hought about , uh , adding , uh , uh ,
anot her class t oo .
m n014 [ s] : But it ’s not t oo easy , I t hink , t he [ disfm arker] t he
t ransit ion bet ween t he different class , t o m odel t hem in [ disfm arker]
in t he sy st em I have now .
m n014 [ s^ am ] : But it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it could be possible ,
I t hink ,

m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ r] : I see .
m n014 [ s^ e] : in principle .
m e013 [ %−−] : Yeah , I m ean , I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ba] : This is all pret t y gross .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , t he [ disfm arker] t h t he reason why , uh , I was
suggest ing originally t hat we look at feat ures is because I t hought ,
well , we ’re doing som et hing we haven’t done before ,
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : we should at least look at t he space and
underst and [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : It seem s like if t wo people [ disfm arker] t wo or m ore people
t alk at once , it should get louder ,
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh , and , uh , uh , t here should be som e discont inuit y
in pit ch cont ours ,
m n014 [ s^ na] : I had t he im pression .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : and , uh , t here should ov erall be a , um , sm aller
proport ion of t he t ot al energy t hat is explained by any part icular
harm onic [ pause] sequence in t he spect rum .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : So t hose are all t hings t hat should be t here .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So far , um , uh , Jose has [ disfm arker] has been
[ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ t 3] : By t he way , I was t old I should be calling you Pepe ,
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ e] : by y our friends ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : but
m e013 [ s^ t c] : Any way ,
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : uh , t he [ disfm arker] has [ disfm arker] has , uh , been
ex ploring , uh , e largely t he energy issue
m e013 [ fh] : and ,
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ s] : as wit h a lot of t hings , it is not [ disfm arker] uh , like t his ,
it ’s not as sim ple as it sounds .

m e013 [ s:qy ] : And t hen t here ’s , you know [ disfm arker] Is it energy ?
Is it log energy ? Is it LPC residual energy ? Is it [ disfm arker] is it
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] is it , uh , delt a of t hose t hings ?
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−:qw.%−−] : Uh , what is it no
m e013 [ s] : Obviously , just a sim ple num ber [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
absolut e num ber isn’t gonna work .
m e013 [ s:qw] : So [ v ocalsound] it should be wit h [ disfm arker]
com pared t o what ?
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Should t here be a long window for t he [ vocalsound]
norm alizing fact or and a short window for what you ’re looking at ?
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s:qw] : Or , you know , how b short should t hey be ?
m e013 [ fh] : So ,
m e013 [ s] : t h he ’s been playing around wit h a lot of t hese different
t hings
m n005 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and so far at least has not com e up wit h
[ v ocalsound] any com binat ion t hat really gave you an indicat or .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So
m e013 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I st ill hav e a hunch t hat t here ’s [ disfm arker]
it ’s in t here som e place ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : but it m ay be [ disfm arker] given t hat you have a lim it ed
t im e here , it [ disfm arker] it just m ay not be t he best t hing t o
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] t o [ disfm arker] t o focus on for t he rem aining
of it .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s^ 2] : To overrule , yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So pit ch − relat ed and harm onic − relat ed , I ’m [ disfm arker]
I ’m [ pause] som ewhat m ore hopeful for it .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But it seem s like if we just wanna get som et hing t o
work ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : t hat , uh , t heir suggest ion of [ disfm arker] of
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Th − t hey were suggest ing going t o Markov m odels ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh , but in addit ion t here ’s an expansion of what Jav ier
did .
m e013 [ s] : And one of t hose t hings , looking at t he st at ist ical
com ponent ,
m n005 [ s^ 2.%] : One .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s] : ev en if t he feat ures t hat you give it are m aybe not ideal for
it , it ’s just sort of t his general filt er bank
m e013 [ s.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] or cepst rum or som et hing
, um [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Eee [ v ocalsound] it ’s in t here som ewhere probably .
m n005 [ qw] : But , eh , what did you t hink about t he possibilit y of using
t he Javier soft ware ?
m n005 [ s] : Eh , I m ean , t he , uh [ disfm arker] t he , uh [ disfm arker] t he
BIC crit erion ,
m n005 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t t o t rain t he [ disfm arker]

eh , t o dist inguish be m m m , t o t rain ov erlapping zone and speech

m n005 [ fh|s^ cs.%−−] : eh , [ vocalsound] I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I
t hink t hat an int erest ing , eh , experim ent , eh , could be , t h eh , t o
prov e t hat , m m m , if s
m n005 [ s.%−−] : we suppose t hat , eh , t he [ disfm arker] t he first st ep
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] I m ean , t he [ disfm arker] t he classifier
m n005 [ qw] : what
m n005 [ qr^ d] : were t he classifier from Javier or classifier from Thilo ?
m n005 [ qw] : W What happen wit h t he second st ep ?
m n005 [ qw] : I [ disfm arker] I m ean , what [ disfm arker] what happen
wit h t he , eh [ disfm arker] t he , uh , clu t he , uh [ disfm arker] t he clu t he
clust ering process ?
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ s^ e] : Using t he [ disfm arker] t he Gaussian .
m e011 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : You m ean Javier ’s ?
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ qw] : What do you m ean ?
m n005 [ qy] : I [ disfm arker] I m ean , t hat is [ disfm arker] is enough
[ disfm arker] is enough , eh , t o work well , eh , t o , eh , separat e or t o
dist inguish , eh , bet ween overlapping zone and , eh , speaker zone ?
m n005 [ s^ df] : Because t h [ vocalsound] if [ disfm arker] if we
[ disfm arker] if we , eh , nnn , develop an classifier [ disfm arker] and t he
second st ep doesn’t work [ pause] well , eh , we have [ pause] anot her
problem .
m e011 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ na] : Yeah . I had t ried doing it by hand at one point wit h a
v ery short sam ple ,
m n005 [ %−] : N
m e011 [ s^ e] : and it worked pret t y well ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : but I haven’t worked wit h it a lot .
m e011 [ s] : So what I d I d I t ook a hand − segm ent ed sam ple
m n005 [ b] : Nnn , yeah .

m e011 [ s] : and I added t en t im es t he am ount of num bers at random ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Oh .
m e011 [ s] : and it did pick out pret t y good boundaries .
m n005 [ fg|%−] : Yeah . But is [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : But t his was just very anecdot al sort of t hing .
m n005 [ s] : But it ’s possible wit h m y segm ent at ion by hand [ pause]
t hat we have inform at ion about t he [ disfm arker] t he overlapping ,
m e011 [ fg|s^ cs] : Right . So if we [ disfm arker] if we fed t he hand −
segm ent at ion t o Jav ier ’s and it doesn’t work , t hen we know som et hing
’s wrong .
m n005 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker] Yeah .
m n005 [ %−] : The [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b.%] : N n Yeah .
m n005 [ s^ aa] : No .
m n005 [ s^ rt ] : The dem onst rat ion by hand . Segm ent at ion by hand I
[ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I t hink is t he fast experim ent .
m e011 [ s^ na] : Yeah . I t hink t hat ’s probably wort hwhile doing .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n005 [ fh|s.%−] : Uh , we can prove t hat t he [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Whet her it ’ll work or not .
m n005 [ s^ rt ] : t his kind o em ph em phasises param et er and Gaussian
