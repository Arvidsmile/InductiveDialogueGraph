m e013 [ z] : Uh , channel one .
m e026 [ z] : Channel t hree .
fn002 [ z] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ z] : Yes .
m e013 [ z] : OK .
m e026 [ z] : Channel t hree .
m n007 [ z] : Ta
m e026 [ z] : Channel t hree . Alright .
m e013 [ fg] : OK ,
m e013 [ qy^ j^ rt ] : did you solv e speech recognit ion last week ?
m e006 [ s] : Alm ost .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Alright !
m e013 [ s^ co] : Let ’s do im age processing .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yes , again .
m n007 [ s^ ba] : Great .
m e018 [ s] : We did it again , Morgan .
m e013 [ s^ ba^ fe] : Alright !
m e006 [ s^ t 1] : Doo − doop , doo − doo .
m n007 [ qw^ t 3.%−−] : What ’s wrong wit h [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s April fift h .
m e013 [ s] : Act ually , Hynek should be get t ing back in t own short ly if
he isn’t already .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Is he gonna com e here ?
m e013 [ h] : Uh .
m e013 [ s^ j^ na] : Well , we ’ll drag him here .
m e013 [ s^ j] : I know where he is .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : So when you said " in t own " , you m ean [ pause]
Oregon .
m e013 [ s^ ng] : U u u u uh , I m eant , you know , t his end of t he world ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s] : y eah , [ v ocalsound] is really what I m eant ,
m e006 [ s^ t 1] : Doo , doo − doo .
m e013 [ s^ df] : uh , cuz he ’s been in Europe .
m e006 [ s^ t 1] : Doo − doo .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ s] : I have som et hing just fairly brief t o report on .
m e013 [ b] : Mm m .
m e018 [ fh|s] : Um , I did som e [ pause] ex perim uh , uh , just a few
m ore ex perim ent s before I had t o , [ vocalsound] uh , go away for t he w
well , t hat week .
m e013 [ s^ ba^ fe] : Great !
m e018 [ qy ] : Was it last week or whenever ?
m e018 [ fh] : Um ,
m e018 [ s] : so what I was st art ed playing wit h was t he [ disfm arker] t h
again , t his is t he HTK back − end .

m e018 [ fh] : And , um ,
m e018 [ s] : I was curious because t he way t hat t hey t rain up t he
m odels , [ v ocalsound] t hey go t hrough about four sort of rounds of
[ disfm arker] of t raining .
m e018 [ s^ e] : And in t he first round t hey do [ disfm arker] uh , I t hink it
’s t hree it erat ions ,
m e018 [ s^ e] : and for t he last t hree rounds e e t hey do seven
it erat ions of re − est im at ion in each of t hose t hree .
m e018 [ fh] : And so ,
m e018 [ s] : y ou know , t hat ’s part of what t akes so long t o t rain t he
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he back − end for t his .
m e013 [ s^ fa] : I ’m sorry ,
m e013 [ s] : I didn’t quit e get t hat .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : There ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s four and t here ’s seven
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ fa] : I [ disfm arker] I ’m sorry .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e018 [ s^ cs] : m ay be I should writ e it on t he board .
m e018 [ s] : So , [ v ocalsound] t here ’s four rounds of t raining .
m e018 [ fh] : Um ,
m e018 [ s] : I g I g I guess you could say it erat ions .
m e018 [ s] : The first one is t hree , t hen seven , seven , and seven .
m e018 [ s^ e] : And what t hese num bers refer t o is t he num ber of t im es
t hat t he , uh , HMM re − est im at ion is run .
m e018 [ s^ e] : It ’s t his program called H E
m e013 [ qw] : But in HTK , what ’s t he difference bet ween , uh , a
[ disfm arker] an inner loop and an out er loop in t hese it erat ions ?
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s] : So what happens is , um , at each one of t hese point s ,
y ou increase t he num ber of Gaussians in t he m odel .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , right !
m e013 [ s] : This was t he m ix up st uff .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ m ^ na] : The m ix up .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right .
m e013 [ s^ t 1] : I rem em ber now .
m e018 [ s] : And so , in t he final one here , you end up wit h , uh
[ disfm arker] for all of t he [ disfm arker] t he digit words , you end up wit h
, uh , t hree [ pause] m ixt ures per st at e ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ e] : eh , in t he final [ pause] t hing .
m e018 [ s] : So I had done som e experim ent s where I was [ disfm arker] I
[ disfm arker] I want t o play wit h t he num ber of m ixt ures .

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ fh] : But , um ,
m e006 [ s^ t 1] : Uh , one , t wo ,
m e018 [ fh|s] : uh , I want ed t o first t est t o see if we act ually need t o
do [ pause] t his m any it erat ions early on .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ fh] : And so ,
m e018 [ fh|s] : um , I [ disfm arker] I ran a couple of experim ent s where I
[ v ocalsound] reduced t hat t o l t o be t hree , t wo , t wo , [ vocalsound] uh
, five , I t hink ,
m e018 [ s] : and I got alm ost t he ex act sam e result s .
m e018 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] but it runs m uch m uch fast er .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ fh] : So , um ,
m e018 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink m [ pause] it only t ook som et hing like ,
uh , t hree or four hours t o do t he full t raining ,
m e013 [ qw^ d.%−−] : As opposed t o [ disfm arker] ?
fn002 [ s^ ba.x ] : Good .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : as opposed t o wh what , sixt een hours or som et hing
like t hat ?
fn002 [ s^ na] : Yeah . It depends .
m e018 [ s^ df] : I m ean , it t akes [ disfm arker] you have t o do an
ov ernight basically , t he way it is set up now .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ fh] : So ,
m e018 [ fh] : uh ,
m e018 [ s] : even we don’t do anyt hing else , doing som et hing like t his
could allow us t o t urn experim ent s around a lot fast er .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t hen when you hav e your final t hing , do a full one
, so it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : And when you have your final t hing , we go back t o t his .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fh] : So , um ,
m e018 [ s] : and it ’s a real sim ple change t o m ake .
m e018 [ s^ e] : I m ean , it ’s like one lit t le t ext file you edit and change
t hose num bers ,
m e018 [ s^ e] : and y ou don’t do anyt hing else .
fn002 [ s.%−−] : Oh , t his is a [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ e] : And t hen you just run .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ b] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ df] : So it ’s a very sim ple change t o m ake
m e018 [ s^ df] : and it doesn’t seem t o hurt all t hat m uch .
m n007 [ qy ^ bu^ d.%−−] : So you [ disfm arker] you run wit h t hree , t wo ,
t wo , fiv e ? That ’s a

m e018 [ s.%−] : So I [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ h|s^ no] : Uh , I [ disfm arker] I hav e t o look t o see what t he
ex act num bers were .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ na] : I [ disfm arker] I t hought was , like , t hree , t wo , t wo ,
five ,
m e018 [ s^ cc] : but I I ’ll [ disfm arker] I ’ll double check .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ df] : It was [ vocalsound] over a week ago t hat I did it ,
m n007 [ b] : OK .
m e006 [ b] : Oh .
m e018 [ s^ df] : so I can’t rem em ber exact ly .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ fh] : But , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : um , but it ’s so m uch fast er .
m e006 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ s] : I it m akes a big difference .
m e018 [ s] : So we could do a lot m ore experim ent s and t hrow a lot
m ore st uff in t here .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : That ’s great .
m e018 [ fh] : Um .
m e018 [ s^ bk|s^ rt ] : Oh , t he ot her t hing t hat I did was , um ,
[ v ocalsound] I com piled [ pause] t he HTK st uff for t he Linux boxes .
m e018 [ s] : So we have t his big t hing t hat we got from IBM ,
m e018 [ s^ e] : which is a five − processor m achine .
m e018 [ s^ e] : Really fast ,
m e018 [ s] : but it ’s running Linux .
m e018 [ s] : So , you can now run your ex perim ent s on t hat m achine
m e018 [ s] : and y ou can run five at a t im e
m e018 [ s] : and it runs , [ vocalsound] uh , as fast as , you know , uh ,
five different m achines .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ fh] : So , um ,
m e018 [ s^ no] : I ’ve forgot t en now what t he nam e of t hat m achine is
m e018 [ s^ cc] : but I can [ disfm arker] I can send em ail around about it
.
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : And so we ’ve got it [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : now HTK ’s com piled for bot h t he Linux and for , um , t he
Sparcs .

m e018 [ s] : Um , y ou have t o m ake [ disfm arker] you have t o m ake sure
t hat in y our dot CSHRC , [ vocalsound] um , it det ect s whet her you ’re
running on t he Linux or a [ disfm arker] a Sparc and point s t o t he right
ex ecut ables .
m e018 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e018 [ s] : and y ou m ay not hav e had t hat in your dot CSHRC before ,
if y ou were always just running t he Sparc .
m e018 [ fh] : So ,
m e018 [ fh] : um ,
m e018 [ s] : uh , I can [ disfm arker] I can t ell you exact ly what you need
t o do t o get all of t hat t o work .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : But it ’ll [ disfm arker] it really increases what we can run on
.
m e006 [ s^ ba] : Hm m . Cool .
m e018 [ s] : So , [ v ocalsound] t oget her wit h t he fact t hat we ’ve got
t hese [ pause] fast er Linux boxes and t hat it t akes less t im e t o do
[ pause] t hese , um , we should be able t o crank t hrough a lot m ore
ex perim ent s .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ fh] : So .
m e006 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ s] : So aft er I did t hat , t hen what I want ed t o do [ com m ent ]
was t ry [ pause] increasing t he num ber of m ixt ures ,
m e018 [ s^ df] : just t o see , um [ disfm arker] see how [ disfm arker] how
t hat affect s perform ance .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fg|s^ cs] : Yeah . In fact , you could do som et hing like [ pause]
keep ex act ly t he sam e procedure and t hen add a fift h t hing ont o it
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Ex act ly .
m e013 [ s] : t hat had m ore .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e018 [ s^ aa^ r] : Right .
m e006 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : So at [ disfm arker] at t he m iddle o where t he arrows
are showing , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] you ’re adding one m ore m ixt ure per
st at e ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m e006 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e018 [ h] : Uh ,
m e018 [ s^ t 1] : let ’s see ,
m e018 [ fh] : uh .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : It goes from

m e018 [ s] : t his [ disfm arker] uh , t ry t o go it backwards [ disfm arker]
t his [ disfm arker] at t his point it ’s t wo m ixt ures [ pause] per st at e .
m e018 [ s^ na] : So t his just adds one .
m e018 [ s^ nd] : Except t hat , uh , act ually for t he silence m odel , it ’s
six m ix t ures per st at e .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ b] : OK .
m e018 [ s] : Uh , so it goes t o t wo .
m e018 [ fh] : Um .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : And I t hink what happens here is [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Might be bet ween , uh , shared , uh [ disfm arker] shared
v ariances or som et hing ,
m e018 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . I t hink t hat ’s what it is .
m e013 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e018 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : yeah . It ’s , uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ fe] : Shoot .
m e018 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I can’t rem em ber now what
happens at t hat first one .
m e018 [ s] : Uh , I have t o look it up and see .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e018 [ fh] : Um ,
m e018 [ s] : t here [ disfm arker] because t hey st art off wit h , uh , an
init ial m odel
m e018 [ s^ e] : which is just t his global m odel ,
m e018 [ s] : and t hen t hey split it t o t he individuals .
m e018 [ s] : And so , [ vocalsound] it m ay be t hat t hat ’s what ’s
happening here .
m e018 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] I have t o look it
up and see .
m e018 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t exact ly rem em ber .
m e006 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s] : So . That ’s it .
m e013 [ fg] : Alright .
m e013 [ qo^ t c] : So what else ?
m n007 [ h] : Um .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : There was a conference call t his Tuesday .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s^ no] : I don’t know yet t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] what
happened [ vocalsound] Tuesday ,
m n007 [ s] : but [ vocalsound] t he point s t hat t hey were supposed t o
discuss is st ill , [ v ocalsound] uh , t hings like [ vocalsound] t he weight s ,
m n007 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s^ bu] : Oh , t his is a conference call for , uh , uh , Aurora
part icipant sort of t hing .
m e006 [ %] : For [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fg] : Mm m .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : Do you know who was [ disfm arker] who was
[ disfm arker] since we weren’t in on it , uh , do you know who was in
from OGI ?
m e013 [ qy^ rt ] : Was [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] was [ disfm arker] was
Hy nek involv ed
m e013 [ qrr] : or was it Sunil
m n007 [ s^ no] : I hav e no idea .
m e013 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , you don’t know .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Mm m , I just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Alright .
m n007 [ fg] : Um ,
m n007 [ fh] : yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So t he point s were t he [ disfm arker] t he weight s
[ disfm arker] how t o weight t he different error rat es [ vocalsound] t hat
are obt ained from different language and [ disfm arker] and condit ions .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s] : it ’s not clear t hat t hey will keep t he sam e kind of
weight ing .
m n007 [ s] : Right now it ’s a weight ing on [ disfm arker] on im provem ent
.
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Som e people are arguing t hat it would be bet t er t o
have weight s on
m n007 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : well , t o [ disfm arker] t o com bine error rat es [ pause]
before com put ing im provem ent .
m n007 [ fh|s] : Uh , and t he fact is t hat for [ disfm arker] right now for
[ pause] t he English , t hey have weight s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : t hey [ disfm arker] t hey com bine error rat es ,
m n007 [ s] : but for t he ot her languages t hey com bine im provem ent .
m n007 [ s] : So it ’s not very consist ent .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : The , um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .

m n007 [ s.%−−] : And so [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Well , [ vocalsound] t his is a point .
m n007 [ s] : And right now act ually t here is a t hing also , [ vocalsound]
uh , t hat happens wit h t he current weight is t hat a very non −
significant im provem ent [ pause] on t he well − m at ched case result in
[ pause] huge differences in [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] in t he final
num ber .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : And so , perhaps t hey will change t he weight s t o
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qw] : How should t hat be done ?
m e018 [ s^ df] : I m ean , it [ disfm arker] it seem s like t here ’s a sim ple
way [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ df] : Uh , t his seem s like an obvious m ist ake or som et hing .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : Th − t hey ’re [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Well , I m ean , t he fact t hat it ’s inconsist ent is an obvious
m ist ake .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But t he [ disfm arker] but , um , t he ot her t hing
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ x] : In
m e013 [ fh] : I don’t know
m e013 [ s] : I haven’t t hought it t hrough ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but one [ disfm arker] one would t hink t hat [ vocalsound]
each [ disfm arker] It [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ e] : it ’s like if you say what ’s t he [ disfm arker] what ’s t he
best way t o do an av erage ,
m e013 [ qr^ d] : an arit hm et ic average or a geom et ric average ?
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : It depends what you wanna show .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : Each [ disfm arker] each one is gonna have a different
charact erist ic .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ cs] : Well , it seem s like t hey should do , like , t he
percent age im prov em ent or som et hing ,
m e018 [ s] : rat her t han t he [ pause] absolut e im provem ent .
m n007 [ s^ nd] : Tha − t hat ’s what t hey do .
m e013 [ s^ nd] : Well , t hey are doing t hat .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : No , t hat is relat ive .

m e013 [ qr] : But t he quest ion is , do you average t he relat ive
im provem ent s [ pause] or do y ou average t he error rat es and t ake t he
relat iv e im prov em ent m aybe of t hat ?
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And t he t hing is it ’s not just a pure average because
t here are t hese weight ings .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s a weight ed average .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : And so when you av erage t he [ disfm arker] t he relat ive
im provem ent it t ends t o [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t o give a lot of
[ disfm arker] of , um , [ vocalsound] im port ance t o t he well − m at ched
case
m n007 [ s^ df] : because [ pause] t he baseline is already very good
m n007 [ fh] : and ,
m n007 [ fh] : um ,
m e018 [ qw^ cs] : Why don’t t hey not look at im provem ent s but just
look at your av y our scores ?
m n007 [ %−−] : i it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ e] : You know , figure out how t o com bine t he scores
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ e] : wit h a weight or what ever ,
m e018 [ s] : and t hen give you a score [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : here ’s your score .
m e018 [ s] : And t hen t hey can do t he sam e t hing for t he baseline
sy st em [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : and here ’s it s score .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : And t hen you can look at [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : Well , t hat ’s what he ’s seeing as one of t he t hings t hey
could do .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : It ’s just when you [ disfm arker] when you get all done ,
I t hink t hat t hey pro
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I m I [ disfm arker] I wasn’t t here
m e013 [ s] : but I t hink t hey st art ed off t his process wit h t he not ion
t hat [ v ocalsound] you should be [ pause] significant ly bet t er t han t he
prev ious st andard .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : And , um ,
m e013 [ s] : so t hey said " how m uch is significant ly bet t er ?
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : what do you [ disfm arker] ? "

m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and so t hey said " well , [ vocalsound] you
know , y ou should have half t he errors , " or som et hing , " t hat you had
before " .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : What it is is just t hat ,
m e018 [ s^ 2] : The t raining and t est ing .

m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and t hen ,

[ disfm arker] t he m ore im port ant t hing , [ vocalsound] is t hat you ’re

[ disfm arker] it ’s a lit t le different .
m e018 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,

[ disfm arker] you know , really sm all .
m e013 [ fg] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e013 [ s.%−] : That ’s a [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a [ disfm arker] t hat ’s an

m e013 [ s^ co] : but let m e give you t he opposit e argum ent .
m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : The opposit e argum ent is you ’re nev er really gonna have

m e013 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat you could m ake t he

m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : You know ,
m e013 [ fh] : so ,
m e013 [ s] : I t hink t he t hing is is t hat if you look at t he well − m at ched
case v ersus t he po y ou know , t he [ disfm arker] t he m edium and t he
[ disfm arker] and t he fo and t hen t he m ism at ched case , [ vocalsound]
um , we ’re seeing really , really big differences in perform ance .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and y y ou wouldn’t like t hat t o be t he

m e013 [ s.%−−] : You wouldn’t like t hat as soon as you st ep out side
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : You know , a lot of t he [ disfm arker] t he cases it ’s
[ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ j] : Well , t hat ’ll t each t hem t o roll t heir window up .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , in t hese cases , if you go from t he [ disfm arker]
t he , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , I don’t rem em ber t he num bers right off ,
m e013 [ s^ r] : but if you [ disfm arker] if you go from t he well − m at ched
case t o t he m edium , [ vocalsound] it ’s not an enorm ous difference in
t he [ disfm arker] in t he [ disfm arker] t he t raining − t est ing sit uat ion ,
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and it ’s a really big
[ v ocalsound] perform ance drop .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : You know ,
m e013 [ fh] : so ,
m e013 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , I m ean t he reference one , for inst ance
[ disfm arker] t his is back old on , uh [ disfm arker] on It alian [ disfm arker]
uh , was like [ pause] six percent error for t he well − m at ched
m e013 [ s] : and eight een for t he m edium − m at ched

m e013 [ s] : and sixt y for t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] for highly −

m e013 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e013 [ s] : and , you know , wit h t hese ot her syst em s we [ disfm arker]
we [ v ocalsound] helped it out quit e a bit ,
m e013 [ s] : but st ill t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s som et hing like a

m e013 [ s.%−−] : And [ vocalsound] so I t hink t hat [ vocalsound] if what
y ou ’re [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] if t he goal of t his is t o com e up wit h

m e013 [ s] : So you could argue , in fact , t hat t he well − m at ched is
som et hing y ou shouldn’t be looking at at all ,
m e013 [ s] : t hat [ disfm arker] t hat t he goal is t o com e up wit h feat ures
[ v ocalsound] t hat will st ill give you reasonable perform ance ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : y ou know , wit h again gent le degregra degradat ion ,
m e013 [ fh|s^ e] : um , even t hough t he [ disfm arker] t he t est ing
condit ion is not t he sam e as t he t raining .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : So , you know , I [ disfm arker] I could argue st rongly
t hat som et hing like t he m edium m ism at ch , which is you know not

m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : I m ean , what was t he [ disfm arker] t he m edium −

m n007 [ h|s.%−−] : Um , [ vocalsound] it ’s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : Medium m ism at ch is every t hing wit h t he far [ pause]
m icrophone ,
m n007 [ s] : but t rained on , like , low noisy condit ion ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : like low speed

m n007 [ s^ e] : like on a highway
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s st ill t he sam e [ disfm arker] sam e m icrophone in

m n007 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ m ^ na] : Sam e m icrophone
m n007 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : but , uh , it ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s a m ism at ch bet ween
t he car condit ions .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : uh , you could argue t hat ’s a pret t y realist ic sit uat ion
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s] : and , uh , I ’d alm ost argue for weight ing t hat highest .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But t he way t hey hav e it now , [ vocalsound] it ’s
[ disfm arker] I guess it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu] : They [ disfm arker] t hey com put e t he relat ive

m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : and t hen av erage t hat wit h a weight ing ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And so t hen t he [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat m akes
t he highly − m at ched t he really big t hing .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ fh|s^ cs] : so , u i since t hey hav e t hese t hree cat egories , it

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ e] : Just say " OK , in t he [ disfm arker] in t he highly − m at ched

t ricky t o m ake any t hing [ vocalsound] ac [ v ocalsound] m ake any

m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,

m n007 [ s] : but t here is probably a [ disfm arker] a big change t hat will
[ v ocalsound] be m ade
m n007 [ s] : is t hat t he [ disfm arker] t he baseline [ disfm arker] t h t hey

m n007 [ s^ e] : which is , um , MFCC
m n007 [ s^ e] : but wit h [ vocalsound] a voice act ivit y det ect or .
m n007 [ s] : And apparent ly , [ vocalsound] uh , som e people are

m e013 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : And if we look at t he result t hat Sunil sent ,
[ v ocalsound] just put t ing t he VAD in t he baseline im proved , like , m ore
t han t went y percent ,

m e013 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : So nobody would [ pause] be t here ,

,

m e013 [ s^ df] : and as well as being a lot of work t o do a good job on
t he feat ure [ vocalsound] design ,
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .

m n007 [ fh] : Uh , y eah .
m n007 [ s] : Per − e s s som eone t old t hat perhaps it ’s not fair t o do

t hat are [ disfm arker] t he baseline feat ures .

m e013 [ s^ bk] : m s Yeah ,
m e013 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Well , let ’s say for ins
m e013 [ s] : see , MFCC for inst ance doesn’t have anyt hing in it , uh ,
relat ed t o t he pit ch .
m e013 [ s] : So just [ disfm arker] just for exam ple .

m e013 [ s] : So suppose you ’ve [ disfm arker] t hat [ vocalsound] what
y ou really wanna do is put a good pit ch det ect or on t here
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and if it get s an unam biguous [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : oh . I see .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ r] : if it get s an unam biguous result t hen you ’re definit ely in
a [ disfm arker] in a [ disfm arker] in a voice in a , uh , s region wit h

m e018 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So t here ’s t his assum pt ion t hat t he v t he voice
act ivit y det ect or can only use t he MFCC ?
m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m n007 [ s^ ng] : That ’s not clear ,
m n007 [ s.%−−] : but t his [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] e
m e013 [ s] : Well , for t he baseline .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So [ disfm arker] so if you use ot her feat ures t hen y
m e013 [ s] : But it ’s just a quest ion of what is your baseline .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e018 [ s.%−−] : I g
m e013 [ s^ e] : What is it t hat you ’re supposed t o do bet t er t han ?

m e013 [ fh] : And so
m e018 [ s.%−] : I don’t s
m e013 [ s] : hav ing t he baseline be t he MFCC ’s [ pause] m eans t hat

m e013 [ s^ aap] : They ’re sort of separat e .
m e013 [ s^ arp] : Unfort unat ely t here ’s coupling bet ween t hem ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : which is part of what I t hink St ephane is get t ing t o , is
t hat [ v ocalsound] you can choose your feat ures in such a way as t o
im prove t he VAD .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And you also can choose your feat ures in such a way as t o
prov e [ disfm arker] im prove recognit ion .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : But it seem s like y ou should do bot h .
m e013 [ s] : They m ay not be t he sam e t hing .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s^ m ^ na] : You should do bot h
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat t his st ill
m akes [ disfm arker] I st ill t hink t his m akes sense as a baseline .

m e013 [ s^ df.%−−] : It ’s just saying , as a baseline , we know
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s^ df] : you know , we had t he MFCC ’s before ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : lot s of people hav e done voice act ivit y det ect ors ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : you m ight as well pick som e voice act ivit y det ect or and
m ake t hat t he baseline ,
m e013 [ s] : just like you picked som e version of HTK and m ade t hat t he
baseline .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen [ pause] let ’s t ry and m ake everyt hing bet t er .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s] : and if one of t he ways y ou m ake it bet t er is by having your
feat ures [ pause] be bet t er feat ures for t he VAD t hen t hat ’s
[ disfm arker] so be it .
m e013 [ %−−] : But ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : uh , uh , uh , at least you have a st art ing point t hat ’s
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ s^ bu^ df] : cuz i i som e of [ disfm arker] t he som e of t he people
didn’t have a VAD at all , I guess .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker] and
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : t hen t hey [ disfm arker] t hey looked pret t y bad
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and in fact what t hey were doing wasn’t
so bad at all .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : But ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ fg|s^ cs] : Yeah . It seem s like you should t ry t o m ake your
baseline as good as possible .
m e013 [ fh] : um .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : And if it t urns out t hat [ pause] you can’t im prove on
t hat , well , I m ean , t hen , you know , nobody wins and you just use
MFCC .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , it seem s like ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ s] : it should include sort of t he current st at e of t he art
[ v ocalsound] t hat y ou want [ disfm arker] are t rying t o im prove ,

m e013 [ s^ na] : and MFCC ’s , you know , or PLP or som et hing
[ disfm arker] it seem s like [ vocalsound] reasonable baseline for t he
feat ures ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : and anybody doing t his t ask , [ vocalsound] uh , is
gonna have som e sort of voice act ivit y det ect ion at som e level , in
som e way .
m e013 [ s] : They m ight use t he whole recognizer t o do it [ vocalsound]
but [ disfm arker] rat her t han [ vocalsound] a separat e t hing ,
m e013 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] but t hey ’ll have it on som e
lev el .
m e013 [ fh] : So ,
m e013 [ fh] : um .
m e018 [ s] : It seem s like what ever t hey choose t hey shouldn’t ,
[ v ocalsound] you know , purposefully brain − dam age a part of t he
sy st em t o [ pause] m ake a worse baseline ,
m e018 [ %−−] : or [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : You know ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Well , I t hink people just had
m e013 [ s^ nd] : it wasn’t t hat t hey purposely brain − dam aged it .
m e013 [ s^ df^ nd] : I t hink people hadn’t really t hought t hrough
[ v ocalsound] about t he , uh [ disfm arker] t he VAD issue .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and t hen when t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t he proposals act ually cam e in and half of t hem had V A
Ds and half of t hem didn’t ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : and t he half t hat did did well
m e013 [ s^ e] : and t he [ vocalsound] half t hat didn’t did poorly .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So it ’s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fg] : Um .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m n007 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fg] : So
m n007 [ s^ co^ t c] : we ’ll see what happen wit h t his .
m n007 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : So what happened since , um , [ vocalsound] last week
is [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : well , from OGI , t hese experim ent s on [ pause] put t ing
VAD on t he baseline .
m n007 [ s] : And t hese experim ent s also are using , uh , som e kind of
noise com pensat ion ,
m n007 [ s] : so spect ral subt ract ion ,
m n007 [ s] : and put t ing on − line norm alizat ion , um , just aft er t his .

m n007 [ s] : So I t hink spect ral subt ract ion , LDA filt ering , and on − line
norm alizat ion ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : so which is sim ilar t o [ vocalsound] t he pro proposal −
one , but wit h [ pause] spect ral subt ract ion in addit ion ,
m n007 [ s] : and it seem s t hat on − line norm alizat ion doesn’t help
furt her when you have spect ral subt ract ion .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t his relat ed t o t he issue t hat you brought up a
couple of m eet ings ago wit h t he [ disfm arker] t he [ vocalsound] m usical
t ones
m n007 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ s^ no] : I hav e no idea ,
m n007 [ s^ df] : because t he issue I brought up was wit h a very sim ple
spect ral subt ract ion approach ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : and t he one t hat [ vocalsound] t hey use at OGI is one
from [ disfm arker] from [ vocalsound] t he proposed [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he Aurora prop uh , proposals ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : which m ight be m uch bet t er .
m n007 [ fh] : So , yeah .
m n007 [ s] : I asked [ vocalsound] Sunil for m ore inform at ion about t hat
,
m n007 [ fh] : but , uh ,
m n007 [ s^ no] : I don’t know yet .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : And what ’s happened here is t hat we [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : so we have t his kind of new , um , reference syst em
which [ vocalsound] use a nice [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a clean
downsam pling − upsam pling ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : which use a new filt er [ vocalsound] t hat ’s m uch short er
m n007 [ s^ e] : and which also cut s t he frequency below sixt y − four
hert z ,
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : which was not done on our first proposal .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : When you say " we have t hat " , does Sunil have it
now , t oo ,
m n007 [ %−−] : I
m e013 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n007 [ s^ ar^ r] : No .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ s^ df^ rt ] : Because we ’re st ill t est ing .
m n007 [ s] : So we have t he result for , [ vocalsound] uh , just t he
feat ures
m e013 [ b] : OK .

m n007 [ s^ rt ] : and we are current ly t est ing wit h put t ing t he neural
net work in t he KLT .
m n007 [ fh|s^ rt ] : Um , it seem s t o im prove on t he well − m at ched case
,
m n007 [ fh|s^ rt ] : um , [ vocalsound] but it ’s a lit t le bit worse on t he
m ism at ch and highly − m ism at ched [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ df] : I m ean when we put t he neural net work .
m n007 [ s] : And wit h t he current weight ing I t hink it ’s sh it will be
bet t er
m n007 [ s^ df] : because t he well − m at ched case is bet t er .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ qw] : But how m uch worse [ disfm arker] since t he weight ing
m ight change [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw] : how [ disfm arker] how m uch worse is it on t he ot her
condit ions ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : when y ou say it ’s a lit t le worse ?
m n007 [ s] : It ’s like , uh , fff , fff [ com m ent ] [ vocalsound] [ pause] um ,
[ com m ent ] [ v ocalsound] [ vocalsound] [ pause] t en percent relat ive .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ fg] : Um .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But it has t he , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : t he lat encies are m uch short er .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : That ’s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Uh − y w when I say it ’s worse , it ’s not [ disfm arker] it ’s
when I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] uh , com pare proposal − t wo t o
proposal − one ,
m n007 [ fh] : so ,
m n007 [ x] : r
m n007 [ fh|s] : uh , y put t ing neural net work [ vocalsound] com pared t o
n not having any neural net work .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ s] : I m ean , t his new syst em is [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] is
bet t er ,
m n007 [ s^ df^ rt ] : because it has [ v ocalsound] um , t his sixt y − four
hert z cut − off ,
m n007 [ fh|s^ df^ rt ] : uh , clean [ v ocalsound] downsam pling ,
m n007 [ fh] : and ,
m n007 [ fh|qw] : um [ disfm arker] what else ?
m n007 [ s^ bk|s] : Uh , yeah , a good VAD .
m n007 [ s] : We put t he good VAD .
m n007 [ fh] : So .
m n007 [ fh|%−−] : Yeah , I don’t know . I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] j uh ,
uh [ disfm arker] pr
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But t he lat encies [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s^ bu] : but you ’ve got t he lat ency short er now .
m n007 [ s^ m ^ na] : Lat ency is short [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ qy ^ g^ t 1] : Isn’t it
m n007 [ %−−] : is [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−] : And so
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s bet t er t han t he syst em t hat we had before .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ df^ na] : Mainly because [ pause] [ vocalsound] of [ pause]
t he six t y − four hert z and t he good VAD .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m n007 [ s] : And t hen I t ook t his syst em and , [ vocalsound] m m m , w uh
, I p we put t he old filt ers also .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : So we have t his good syst em , wit h good VAD ,
m n007 [ s] : wit h t he short filt er and wit h t he long filt er ,
m n007 [ fh] : and ,
m n007 [ fh] : um ,
m n007 [ s] : wit h t he short filt er it ’s not worse .
m n007 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ qy^ g] : well , is it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s all fine .
m n007 [ %−] : it ’s in [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu.%−−] : But what you ’re saying is t hat when you do t hese
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fg] : Yes . Uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ co] : So let m e t ry t o underst and .
m e013 [ s^ bu.%−−] : When [ disfm arker] when you do t hese sam e
im provem ent s [ v ocalsound] t o proposal − one ,
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bu.%−−] : t hat , uh , on t he [ disfm arker] i
m e013 [ s^ bu] : t hings are som ewhat bet t er , uh , in proposal − t wo for
t he well − m at ched case
m e013 [ s^ bu] : and som ewhat worse for t he ot her t wo cases .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy.%−−] : So does , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu.%−−] : when you say , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ] : The t h now t hat t hese ot her t hings are in t here , is it t he
case m ay be t hat t he addit ions of proposal − t wo over proposal − one
are [ pause] less im im port ant ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ na] : Probably , yeah .
m e013 [ s^ t 1] : I get it .
m n007 [ fg] : Um [ disfm arker]

m n007 [ fg] : So , yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Uh .
m n007 [ s^ bk|s^ rt ^ t c] : Yeah , but it ’s a good t hing anyway t o have
[ v ocalsound] short er delay .
m n007 [ s] : Then we t ried , um , [ vocalsound] t o do som et hing like
proposal − t wo
m n007 [ s] : but hav ing , um , e using also MSG feat ures .
m n007 [ s] : So t here is t his KLT part , which use just t he st andard
feat ures ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m n007 [ s] : and t hen t wo neura t wo neural net works .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m ,
m n007 [ fh|s] : and it doesn’t seem t o help .
m n007 [ fh|s] : Um , however , we just have [ vocalsound] one result ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : which is t he It alian m ism at ch ,
m n007 [ fh] : so .
m n007 [ fh] : Uh .
m n007 [ s] : We hav e t o wait for t hat t o fill t he whole t able ,
m n007 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : There was a [ vocalsound] st art of som e effort on
som et hing relat ed t o voicing or som et hing .
m e013 [ qy .%−−] : Is t hat [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh|s^ aa^ r] : Um , [ vocalsound] yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So basically we t ry t o , [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] uh , find
[ v ocalsound] good feat ures t hat could be used for voicing det ect ion ,
m n007 [ fh|s.%−−] : uh , but it ’s st ill , uh [ disfm arker] on t he ,
m n007 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s] : Oh , well , I have t he pict ure .
m n007 [ x] : t
m n007 [ s] : we [ disfm arker] w basically we are st ill playing wit h Mat lab
t o [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] t o look at [ disfm arker] at what happened
,
m e018 [ qw.%−] : What sort s of [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : what sort s of feat ures are you looking at ?
fn002 [ s.%−] : We have som e [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : So we would be looking at , um , t he [ pause] variance
of t he spect rum of t he excit at ion ,
fn002 [ s^ t 3] : uh , um , t his , t his , and t his .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : som et hing like t his ,

m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : which is [ disfm arker] should be high for voiced
sounds .
m n007 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e018 [ s^ co] : Wait a m inut e .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : I [ disfm arker] what does t hat m ean ?
m n007 [ %−] : we [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ e] : The v ariance of t he spect rum of excit at ion .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : So t he [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s.%−] : So basically t he spect rum of t he excit at ion [ vocalsound]
for a purely periodic sig signal shou sh
m e013 [ fg] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ bk.%−−] : Yeah , w
m e013 [ s] : what yo what you ’re calling t he excit at ion , as I recall , is
y ou ’re subt ract ing t he [ disfm arker] t he , um [ disfm arker] t he m el
[ disfm arker] m el [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] m el filt er , uh , spect rum
from t he FFT spect rum .
m n007 [ %] : e
m n007 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n007 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So we have t he m el f filt er bank ,
m n007 [ s] : we have t he FFT ,
m n007 [ s.%−] : so we [ pause] just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not really an excit at ion ,
m e013 [ s] : but it ’s som et hing t hat hopefully t ells you som et hing
about t he excit at ion .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : No .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , t hat ’s right .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ b] : yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
fn002 [ s] : We hav e here som e hist ogram ,
fn002 [ s] : but t hey have a lot of overlap .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : E y eah ,
m n007 [ s.%−−] : but it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s st ill [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fg] : So ,
m n007 [ fg] : well ,
m n007 [ s] : for unvoiced port ion we have som et hing t ha [ vocalsound]
t hat has a m ean around O point t hree ,
m n007 [ s] : and for voiced port ion t he m ean is O point fift y − nine .

m n007 [ s^ rt ] : But t he variance seem quit e [ vocalsound] high .
m e018 [ qw.%−−] : How do you know [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ %−−] : So [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m .
m e018 [ qw] : How did you get your [ pause] voiced and unvoiced t rut h
dat a ?
m n007 [ s] : We used , uh , TIMIT
m n007 [ s] : and we used canonical m appings bet ween t he phones
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fn002 [ s] : We , uh , use [ pause] TIMIT on t his ,
m n007 [ fh] : and
fn002 [ %−−] : for [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : t h Yeah .
fn002 [ s] : But if we look at it in one sent ence , it [ disfm arker]
apparent ly it ’s good ,
fn002 [ s] : I t hink .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : Uh , so it ’s noisy TIMIT .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right .
m e006 [ s^ t 1] : It ’s noisy TIMIT .
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : It seem s quit e robust t o noise ,
m n007 [ s] : so when we t ake [ disfm arker] we draw it s param et ers
across t im e for a clean sent ence and t hen nois t he sam e noisy
sent ence , it ’s v ery close .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah . So t here are [ disfm arker] t here is t his .
m n007 [ s] : There could be also t he , um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
som et hing like t he m axim um of t he aut o − correlat ion funct ion
m n007 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Is t his a [ disfm arker] a s a t rained syst em ?
m n007 [ %−] : which [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qrr] : Or is it a syst em where you just pick som e t hresholds ?
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : Ho − how does it work ?
m n007 [ s] : Right now we just are t ry ing t o find som e feat ures .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : And ,
m n007 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : Yeah . Hopefully , I t hink what we want t o have is
t o put t hese feat ures in s som e kind of ,
m n007 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh|s] : well , t o [ disfm arker] t o obt ain a st at ist ical m odel on
t hese feat ures

m n007 [ s^ rt ] : and t o [ disfm arker] or just t o use a neural net work
m n007 [ s] : and hopefully t hese feat ures w would help [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu] : Because it seem s like what you said about t he m ean
of t he [ disfm arker] t he voiced and t he unvoiced [ disfm arker]
[ com m ent ] [ v ocalsound] t hat seem ed pret t y encouraging .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ arp] : Well , yeah , except t he variance was big .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ ba^ m ] : Except t he variance is quit e high .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e018 [ fg] : Well , y
m e018 [ s^ nd] : Well , y I [ disfm arker] I don’t know t hat I would t rust
t hat so m uch
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ df] : because you ’re doing t hese canonical m appings from
TIMIT labellings .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ fh] : So ,
m e018 [ s^ df] : really t hat ’s sort of a cart oon pict ure about what ’s
v oiced and unvoiced .
m e018 [ s] : So t hat could be giving y ou a lot of variance .
m e018 [ fh] : I m ean ,
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : i it [ disfm arker] it m ay be t hat [ disfm arker] t hat you ’re
finding som et hing good
m e018 [ s] : and t hat t he variance is sort of art ificial because of how
y ou ’re get t ing y our t rut h .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But anot her way of looking at it [ vocalsound] m ight be
t hat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ df] : I m ean , what w we we are com ing up wit h feat ure set s
aft er all .
m e013 [ s] : So anot her way of looking at it is t hat [ vocalsound] um ,
t he m el cepst ru m el [ pause] spect rum , m el cepst rum , [ vocalsound]
any of t hese variant s , um , give you t he sm oot h spect rum .
m e013 [ s^ e] : It ’s t he spect ral envelope .
m e013 [ s] : By going back t o t he FFT , [ v ocalsound] you ’re get t ing
som et hing t hat is [ pause] m ore like t he raw dat a .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So t he quest ion is , what charact erizat ion [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : and y ou ’re playing around wit h t his [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ qw] : anot her way of looking at it is what charact erizat ion
[ v ocalsound] of t he difference bet ween [ pause] t he raw dat a [ pause]
and t his sm oot h v ersion [ pause] is som et hing t hat you ’re m issing t hat
could help ?
m e013 [ s] : So , I m ean , looking at different st at ist ical m easures of
t hat difference ,
m e013 [ s] : com ing up wit h som e t hings and just t rying t hem out
m e013 [ s] : and seeing if you add t hem ont o t he feat ure vect or does
t hat m ake t hings bet t er or worse in noise ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : where you ’re really just i i
m e013 [ s] : t he way I ’m looking at it is not so m uch you ’re t rying t o f
find t he best [ disfm arker] t he world ’s best voiced − unvoiced , uh , uh ,
classifier ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : but it ’s m ore t hat , [ v ocalsound] you know , uh , uh , t ry
som e different st at ist ical charact erizat ions of t hat difference back t o
t he raw dat a
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and
m e018 [ s^ aa^ r] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : m m aybe t here ’s som et hing t here t hat [ pause] t he
sy st em can use .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , but t her m ore obvious is t hat [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ r.%−−] : The [ disfm arker] t he m ore obvious is t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh|s] : well , using t he [ disfm arker] t h t he FFT , um ,
[ v ocalsound] you just [ disfm arker] it gives you just inform at ion about if
it ’s voiced or not voiced , m a m ainly , I m ean .
m n007 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker] So ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : t his is why we [ disfm arker] we st art ed t o look [ pause] by
having sort of voiced phonem es
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Well , t hat ’s t he rea
m e013 [ s.%−] : w w what I ’m arguing is t hat ’s
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , uh , what I ’m arguing is t hat t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat ’s giv i you [ disfm arker] giv es you your int uit ion .
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : But in [ disfm arker] in realit y , it ’s [ disfm arker] you know ,
t here ’s all of t his [ disfm arker] t his overlap and so fort h ,
m e006 [ s^ fa^ t 3] : Oh , sorry .
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] But what I ’m saying is t hat m ay be OK ,

m e013 [ s^ df] : because what you ’re really get t ing is not act ually
v oiced v ersus unv oiced ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : bot h for t he fac t he reason of t he overlap and
[ disfm arker] and t hen , uh , t h you know , st ruct ural reasons ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : uh , uh , like t he one t hat Chuck said ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : t hat [ disfm arker] t hat in fact , well , t he dat a it self is
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] t hat y ou ’re working wit h is not perfect .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s] : So , what I ’m saying is m ay be t hat ’s not a killer
m e013 [ s^ df] : because you ’re just get t ing som e charact erizat ion ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : one t hat ’s driven by your int uit ion about voiced −
unv oiced cert ainly ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : but it ’s just som e charact erizat ion [ vocalsound] of
som et hing back in t he [ disfm arker] in t he [ disfm arker] in t he alm ost
raw dat a , rat her t han t he sm oot h version .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And y our int uit ion is driving you t owards part icular kinds of
, [ v ocalsound] uh , st at ist ical charact erizat ions of , um , what ’s
m issing from t he spect ral envelope .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , obviously you have som et hing about t he excit at ion
,
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ s] : and what is it about t he ex cit at ion ,
m e013 [ s] : and , you know [ disfm arker] and you ’re not get t ing t he
ex cit at ion anyway , you know .
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : so I [ disfm arker] I would alm ost t ake a [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s^ cs^ r] : uh , especially if [ disfm arker] if t hese t rainings
and so fort h are fast er , I would alm ost just t ake a [ vocalsound] uh , a
scat t ershot at a few different [ v ocalsound] ways of look of
charact erizing t hat difference
m e013 [ fh|s^ cs] : and , uh , you could have one of t hem but
[ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and see , you know , which of t hem helps
.
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ rt ] : So i is t he idea t hat you ’re going t o t ake [ pause]
what ev er feat ures y ou develop and [ disfm arker] and just add t hem
ont o t he fut ure v ect or ?
m n007 [ b] : OK .
m e018 [ qw] : Or , what ’s t he use of t he [ disfm arker] t he voiced −
unv oiced det ect or ?
m n007 [ h|s^ no] : Uh , I guess we don’t know exact ly yet .
m n007 [ fh] : But , [ vocalsound] um [ disfm arker]

m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : It ’s not part of a VAD syst em t hat you ’re doing ?
m n007 [ %−−] : Th
fn002 [ s^ aa] : No .
m n007 [ h|s^ aa] : Uh , no .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ s^ aa^ r] : No .
m n007 [ s^ df^ rt ] : No , t he idea was , I guess , t o [ disfm arker] t o use
t hem as [ disfm arker] as feat ures .
m e018 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Feat ures .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n007 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Yeah , it could be , uh [ disfm arker] it could be
[ v ocalsound] a neural net work t hat does voiced and unvoiced
det ect ion ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : but it could be in t he [ disfm arker] also t he big neural
net work t hat does phonem e classificat ion .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But each one of t he m ixt ure com ponent s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , you have , uh , uh , v ariance only ,
m e013 [ s] : so it ’s kind of like you ’re just m ult iplying t oget her t hese ,
um , probabilit ies from t he individual feat ures [ pause] wit hin each
m ix t ure .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : so ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e018 [ s^ ba] : I t hink it ’s a neat t hing .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : it seem s l you know [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Uh , it seem s like a good idea .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , [ vocalsound] I know t hat , um , people doing som e
robust ness t hings a ways back were [ disfm arker] were just doing
[ disfm arker] just being gross and just t hrowing in t he FFT
m e013 [ s] : and act ually it wasn’t [ disfm arker] wasn’t [ disfm arker]
wasn’t so bad .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : Uh , so it would s
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and you know t hat i it ’s got t a hurt you a

[ disfm arker] a s a sm oot h spect ral envelope ,

m e013 [ s] : so t here m ust be som et hing else t hat you get [ pause] in
ret urn for t hat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : t hat , uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ qw.%−−] : So how does [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : uh , m ay be I ’m going in t oo m uch det ail ,
m e018 [ qw] : but [ v ocalsound] how exact ly do you m ake t he difference
bet ween t he FFT and t he sm oot hed [ pause] spect ral envelope ?
m e018 [ qw.%−−] : Wha − wh i i uh , how is t hat , uh [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ h|s.%−−] : Um , we just [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ qw^ t 3] : How did we do it up again ?
fn002 [ h|s^ rt ] : Uh , we dist end t he [ disfm arker] we have t he t went y −
t hree coefficient af aft er t he m el f [ vocalsound] filt er ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ s^ rt ] : and we ext end t hese coefficient bet ween t he
[ disfm arker] all t he frequency range .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ s] : And i t he int erpolat ion i bet ween t he point [ vocalsound] is
[ disfm arker] give for t he t riang t riangular filt er , t he value of t he
t riangular filt er
fn002 [ s] : and of t his way we obt ained t his m ode t his m odel speech .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So you essent ially t ake t he values t hat [ disfm arker] t h
t hat y ou get from t he t riangular filt er and ext end t hem
m n007 [ %−−] : S
m e013 [ s^ bu] : t o sor sort of like a rect angle , t hat ’s at t hat m value .
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : Yeah . I t hink we have linear int erpolat ion .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : So we have [ disfm arker] we have one point for
[ disfm arker] one energy for each filt er bank ,
fn002 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : m m m Yeah , it ’s linear .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ b] : Oh .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : which is [ pause] t he energy [ pause] t hat ’s cent ered
on [ disfm arker] on [ disfm arker] on t he t riangle [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s^ 2.%−−] : At t he n
fn002 [ s^ 2] : at t he cent er of t he filt er [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu] : So you [ disfm arker] you end up wit h a vect or t hat ’s
t he sam e lengt h as t he FFT [ pause] vect or ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : And t hen you just , uh , com put e differences

fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
fn002 [ s] : I have here one exam ple if you [ disfm arker] if you want see
som et hing like t hat .
m e018 [ %−−] : and ,
m n007 [ s^ m ^ na] : Then we com put e t he difference .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : uh , sum t he differences ?
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m n007 [ %] : So .
m n007 [ s] : And I t hink t he variance is com put ed only from , like , t wo

m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh ! OK .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ s^ 2] : Two t hou t wo [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] fift een hundred ?
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Because [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Right .
fn002 [ s] : Two hundred and fift y t housand .
m n007 [ s^ nd] : Fift een hundred .
m n007 [ s^ df.%−−] : Because [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
fn002 [ s] : Two t housand and fift een hundred .
m n007 [ s^ df.%−−] : Above , um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] it seem s t hat
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ df] : Well , som e voiced sound can have also , [ vocalsound]
like , a noisy [ pause] part on high frequencies ,
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ %−−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : No , it ’s [ disfm arker] m akes sense t o look at [ pause] low
frequencies .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Well , it ’s just [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So t his is [ disfm arker] uh , basically t his is
com paring [ v ocalsound] an original version of t he signal t o a

fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So i so i i t his is [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s] : I m ean , i you could argue about whet her it should be
linear int erpolat ion or [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker] or
zeroet h order ,
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker] but
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .

m e013 [ s] : at any rat e som et hing like t his [ pause] is what you ’re
feeding y our recognizer , t ypically .
m e018 [ qw^ d.%−−] : Like which of t he [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , so t he m el cepst rum is t he [ disfm arker] is t he
[ disfm arker] is t he cepst rum of t his [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t his , uh
, spect rum or log spect rum ,
m n007 [ s^ t 3.%−−] : So t his is [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Right , right .
m e013 [ s^ e.%−−] : what ever it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qr] : You − y ou ’re subt ract ing in [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in
[ v ocalsound] power dom ain or log dom ain ?
m n007 [ s] : In log dom ain .
fn002 [ s] : Log dom ain .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s sort of like div ision , when you do t he [ disfm arker]
y eah , t he spect ra .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Uh , y eah .
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : It ’s t he rat io .
m e013 [ h] : Um .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : But , anyway ,
m e013 [ fg] : um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : and t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw] : So what ’s t h uh , what ’s t he int uit ion behind t his kind of
a t hing ?
m e018 [ s^ df] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know really know t he signal −

what is t hat doing .
m n007 [ fg] : So .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa^ t 3] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ na^ t 3] : I guess t hat m akes sense .
m n007 [ s] : What happen if [ disfm arker] what we have [ disfm arker]
have [ disfm arker] what we would like t o have is [ pause] som e
spect rum of t he ex cit at ion signal ,
m e013 [ s^ aa^ t 3] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ e] : which is for voiced sound ideally
m n007 [ s^ e] : a [ disfm arker] a pulse t rain
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ s] : and for unvoiced it ’s som et hing t hat ’s m ore flat .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .

m e018 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : And t he way t o do t his [ vocalsound] is t hat
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : well , we have t he [ disfm arker] we have t he FFT because it
’s com put ed in [ disfm arker] in t he [ disfm arker] in t he syst em ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : and we have [ vocalsound] t he m el [ vocalsound] filt er

m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : and so if we [ disfm arker] if we , like , rem ove t he m el filt er

m e006 [ x ] : Oh .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : It ’s som et hing t hat ’s like [ vocalsound] a
[ disfm arker] a a t rain of p a pulse t rain for voiced sound
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh ! OK .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : and t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat should be flat for

[ disfm arker] t he R − zero energy .
m n007 [ qy ^ t 3.%−−] : Do you have t he m ean [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ qy ^ r^ t 3] : do you hav e t he m ean for t he aut o − correlat ion
[ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s] : Uh , first order for speech recognit ion , you say " I don’t
care about t he source " .
fn002 [ s^ 2^ t 3.%−−] : For [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s^ aa^ t 3] : Yeah .
fn002 [ s^ na^ t 3] : I have t he m ean .
m n007 [ s^ nd^ t 3] : Well , I m ean for t he [ disfm arker] t he energy .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : And so y ou just want t o find out what t he filt ers are .
fn002 [ s^ aa^ t 3] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : The filt ers [ vocalsound] roughly act like a , um [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] a , uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] a an overall resonant
[ disfm arker] you know , f som e resonances and so fort h t hat t h t hat ’s
processing excit at ion .
fn002 [ s^ na^ t 3] : Here .
m n007 [ s^ t 3] : They should be m ore close .
fn002 [ s^ ar^ t 3] : Ah , no .
fn002 [ s^ rt ^ t 3] : This is t his ?
fn002 [ s^ rt ^ t 3] : More close . Is t his ?
fn002 [ s^ t 3] : And t his .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ bk^ t 3] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ t 3.%−−] : So t hey are [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ t 3] : t his is [ disfm arker] t here is less difference .
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So if you look at t he spect ral envelope , just t he very
sm oot h propert ies of it , [ vocalsound] y ou get som et hing closer t o t hat
.
m n007 [ s^ t 3] : This is less [ disfm arker] it ’s less robust .
fn002 [ s^ m ^ na^ t 3] : Less robust .

fn002 [ s^ aa^ t 3] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Oh , y eah .
m e013 [ s] : And t he not ion is if you have t he full spect rum , wit h all t he
lit t le nit t y − grit t y det ails , [ vocalsound] t hat t hat has t he effect of bot h
,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : and it would be a m ult iplicat ion in [ disfm arker] in frequency
dom ain
m e013 [ s^ e] : so t hat would be like an addit ion in log [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] power spect rum dom ain .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And so t his is saying , well , if you really do have t hat
[ v ocalsound] sort of vocal t ract envelope , and you subt ract t hat off ,
what y ou get is t he excit at ion .
m e013 [ s] : And I call t hat lies because you don’t really have t hat ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : y ou just have som e kind of [ vocalsound] signal −
processing t rickery t o get som et hing t hat ’s kind of sm oot h .
m e013 [ s^ df] : It ’s not really what ’s happening in t he vocal t ract
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df] : so you ’re not really get t ing t he vocal excit at ion .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ df] : That ’s why I was going t o t he [ disfm arker] why I was
referring t o it in a m ore [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] a m ore , uh ,
[ v ocalsound] uh , [ v ocalsound] conservat ive way ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : when I was saying " well , it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : y eah ,
m e013 [ s] : it ’s t he excit at ion " .
m e013 [ s] : But it ’s not really t he excit at ion .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : It ’s what ever it is t hat ’s different bet ween [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so , st and st anding back from t hat , you
sort of say t here ’s t his very det ailed represent at ion .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : This m oved in t he [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : You go t o a sm oot h represent at ion .
m e013 [ s^ df^ r] : You go t o a sm oot h represent at ion cuz t his t ypically
generalizes bet t er .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s] : but whenever you sm oot h you lose som et hing ,
m e013 [ s] : so t he quest ion is have y ou lost som et hing you can you
use ?
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Right .

m e013 [ fh|s^ cs] : Um , probably you wouldn’t want t o go t o t he
ex t rem e of just t a saying " OK , our feat ure set will be t he FFT " ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : cuz we really t hink we do gain som et hing in robust ness
from going t o som et hing sm oot her ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : but m aybe t here ’s som et hing t hat we m issed .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qw] : So what is it ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t hen you go back t o t he int uit ion t hat ,
m e013 [ s] : well , y ou don’t really get t he excit at ion ,
m e013 [ s] : but y ou get som et hing relat ed t o it .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And it [ disfm arker] and as y ou can see from t hose pict ures
, you do get som et hing [ vocalsound] t hat shows som e periodicit y , uh ,
in frequency ,
m e018 [ qh^ bh^ rt ] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : you know ,
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and also in t im e .
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ ba] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s really neat .
m e013 [ fg] : so ,
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So you don’t hav e one for unvoiced [ pause]

fn002 [ s^ nd] : Uh , not here .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fn002 [ s^ nd] : But not here .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But presum ably you ’ll see som et hing t hat won’t have

m n007 [ fg] : But [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah . Well .

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ s^ nd] : I don’t have .
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ d.%−−] : And so y ou said t his is pret t y [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : doing t his kind of t hing is pret t y robust t o noise ?
m n007 [ s^ na] : It seem s ,
m n007 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
fn002 [ b] : Pfft .
m e018 [ b] : Huh .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
fn002 [ s] : Oops .
fn002 [ s] : The m ean is different [ vocalsound] wit h it ,
fn002 [ s^ df.%−−] : because t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t he
hist ogram for t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t he classifica
m n007 [ s^ ar] : No , no , no .
m n007 [ s^ df.%−−] : But t h t he kind of robust ness t o noise [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Oh !
m n007 [ s.%−−] : So if [ disfm arker] if you t ake t his fram e , [ vocalsound]
uh , from t he noisy ut t erance and t he sam e fram e from t he clean
ut t erance [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ qy^ 2] : You end up wit h a sim ilar difference
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Y y y yeah .
m n007 [ s^ na^ r.%−−] : We end up wit h [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : ov er here ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fn002 [ s^ rt ] : I have here t he sam e fram e for t he [ pause] clean

m e018 [ s^ ba^ bk] : Cool !
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , t hat ’s clean .
fn002 [ s.%−−] : t he sam e cle
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK
fn002 [ s] : But t hey are a difference .
fn002 [ s^ df^ rt ] : Because here t he FFT is only wit h [ vocalsound] t wo
hundred fift y − six point
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ %−−] : t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s] : and t his is wit h five hundred [ pause] t welve .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : This is kind of int er int erest ing also
m n007 [ s^ df] : because if we use t he st andard , [ vocalsound] uh ,
fram e lengt h of [ disfm arker] of , like , t went y − five m illiseconds ,
[ v ocalsound] um , [ vocalsound] what happens is t hat for low − pit ched

[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] you don’t clearly see t his periodic st ruct ure ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n007 [ s^ df] : because of t he first lobe of [ disfm arker] of each
[ disfm arker] each of t he harm onics .
m e018 [ s^ bu.%−−] : So t his one inclu is a longer [ disfm arker] Ah .
m n007 [ s] : So , t his is like [ disfm arker] yeah , fift y m illiseconds or
som et hing like t hat .
fn002 [ s^ m ^ na.%−−] : Fift y m illis
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : Yeah , but it ’s t he sam e fram e
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu] : Oh , it ’s t hat t im e − frequency t rade − off t hing .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fg] : So , yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Oh . Oh , so t his i is t his t he difference here ,
fn002 [ s^ ar] : No .
fn002 [ s^ nd] : This is t he signal .
m e018 [ qy^ d^ e^ rt ] : for t hat ?
fn002 [ s^ nd^ r] : This is t he signal .
m n007 [ s] : I see t hat .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Oh , yeah .
fn002 [ s] : The fram e .
m e018 [ s] : Oh , t hat ’s t he f t he original .
fn002 [ s^ na] : This is t he fra t he original fram e .
m n007 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So wit h a short fram e basically you have only t wo periods
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : and it ’s not [ disfm arker] not enough t o [ disfm arker] t o
have t his kind of neat t hings .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .

fn002 [ s.%−−] : And here [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s^ ar] : No , well .
m n007 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ cs] : So probably we ’ll have t o use , [ vocalsound] like , long

[ disfm arker] if y ou ’re act ually asking [ disfm arker] you know , if you

[ disfm arker] it m ay be pushing t hings .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker] and , uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Would you [ disfm arker] would you wanna do t his kind

?
m n007 [ h|s^ am ] : Uh , [ vocalsound] m aybe .
fn002 [ s^ ar] : No .
fn002 [ s^ am ] : Maybe we can do t hat .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m .
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : The spect ral subt ract ion is being done
m e013 [ qw] : at what level ? Is it being done
m e013 [ qy ^ e^ rt ] : at t he level of FFT bins

m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,

m n007 [ fh] : so .
m n007 [ fh] : So , yeah ,
m n007 [ s.%−−] : probably [ disfm arker]
