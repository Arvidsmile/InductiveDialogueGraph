,
fe008 [ %−−] : so I [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy^ bh] : Oh really .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .

fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qr.%−−] : " Spikes " , you m ean like uh , inst ant aneous click t ype

fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : Well , I t hink it ’s
m n014 [ s^ 2] : Touching .
m e011 [ fh|s] : uh , it [ disfm arker] it could be a num ber of t hings .
m e011 [ s^ e] : It could be t ouching and fiddling ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : and t he ot her t hing is t hat it could [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : t he fact t hat it ’s on a wired m ike is suspicious .
m e011 [ s] : It m ight be a connect or .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
fe008 [ %−−] : Well m aybe [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ cs.%−−] : Then we don’t really have t o t alk about t hat as an
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I t ake t hat off t he agenda .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : You could t ry an experim ent and say " OK , I ’m about
t o t est for spikes " ,
m e018 [ s^ cs] : and t hen wiggle t he t hing t here ,
m e018 [ s] : and t hen go and when t hey go t o t ranscribe it , it could ,
ask t hem t o com e and get you .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ %−] : Oh t hat [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ cs^ e] : " Com e get m e when you t ranscribe t his and see if
t here ’s spikes . "
m e013 [ fg] : Um .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Well , OK .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : No I ’m just [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ x ] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , were t his a professional audio recording ,
[ v ocalsound] what we would do [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] what you
would do is [ disfm arker] in t est ing it is , you would act ually do all t his
wiggling and m ake sure t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat t hings
are not giving t hat kind of perform ance .
m e013 [ s] : And if t hey are , t hen t hey can’t be used .
m e011 [ b] : Right .

m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fh|s^ t 1] : Um . Let ’s see .
m e013 [ s^ t ^ t c] : I guess [ pause] I would like t o have a discussion
about y ou know where we are on uh , recording , t ranscript ion
m e013 [ s] : y ou know , basically y ou know where we are on t he corpus
.
fe008 [ b.x ] : Good .
m e013 [ s^ t ] : And t hen um , t he ot her t hing which I would like t o t alk
about which is a real m et a − quest , I t hink , deal is , uh , agendas .
m e013 [ s^ t c] : So m aybe I ’ll [ disfm arker] I ’ll st art wit h t hat act ually .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , um . [ vocalsound] Andreas brought up t he fact t hat
he would kinda like t o know , if possible , what we were gonna be
t alking about
m e013 [ s^ df] : because he ’s sort of peripherally involved t o t his point
,
m e013 [ s] : and if t here ’s gonna be a t opic about [ disfm arker]
discussion about som et hing t hat he uh st rongly cares about t hen he
would com e
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] And I t hink part of [ disfm arker] part of his
m ot ivat ion wit h t his is t hat he ’s t rying t o help us out ,
m e013 [ s] : in t he [ disfm arker] because of uh t he fact t hat t he
m eet ings are [ disfm arker] are t ending t o becom e reasonably large
now on day s when everybody shows up
m e013 [ s] : and so , he figures he could help t hat out by not showing
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and I ’m sure help out his own t im e .
m e011 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : by not showing up if it ’s a m eet ing t hat he ’s
[ disfm arker] he ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So , uh in order [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I ’d [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat t his is a wish on his part .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh . It ’s act ually gonna be hard
m e013 [ s^ df] : because it seem s like a lot of t im es uh t hings com e up
t hat are unant icipat ed
m e013 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ cs] : But um , we could t ry anyway ,
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh , do anot her t ry at com ing up wit h t he agenda uh , at
som e point before t he m eet ing ,
m e013 [ fh|s^ cs] : uh , say t he day before .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : Well m aybe it would be a good idea for one of us t o
[ pause] like on Wednesday , or Tuesday send out a rem inder for
people t o send in agenda it em s .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : OK .
m e013 [ qy^ cs^ rt ] : You [ disfm arker] y ou wanna volunt eer t o do t hat ?

m e011 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : Alright so we ’ll send out agenda request .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m e011 [ %−] : Let m e
m e018 [ s.%−−] : That ’ll be [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s.%−] : I t hink t hat ’ll help [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : I ’ll put t hat on m y spare brain or it will not [ pause] get
done .
m e018 [ s^ r] : That ’ll help a lot , act ually .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah , I have t o t ell you for t he uh [ disfm arker] for t he
adm in m eet ing t hat we have , Lila does t hat um every t im e before an
adm in m eet ing .
m e013 [ s] : And uh , she ends up get t ing t he agenda request s uh , uh
t en m inut es before t he m eet ing .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] But .
m e013 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : Uh . [ com m ent ] But we can t ry .
m e013 [ s] : May be it ’ll work .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m e011 [ s^ am ] : Maybe .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ j^ rt ] : Weirder t hings have happened .
fe008 [ s] : I ’m wondering if he were t o just , uh , specify part icular
t opics ,
fe008 [ %−−] : I m ean .
fe008 [ s] : Maybe we ’d be able t o m eet t hat request of his a lit t le
m ore .
m e018 [ s] : I would [ disfm arker] I would also guess t hat as we get
m ore int o processing t he dat a and t hings like t hat t here ’ll be m ore
t hings of int erest t o him .
m e011 [ %−] : Well t hen [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|%−] : Act ually it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ t c.%−−] : This [ disfm arker] t his m aybe brings up anot her
t opic which is um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ t c] : So we ’re done wit h t hat t opic .
m e013 [ s^ t ] : The ot her t opic I was t hinking of was t he st a st at us on
m icrophones and channels , and all t hat .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , act ually I [ disfm arker] I was going t o say we
need t o [ pause] t alk about t hat t oo .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qh^ cs] : Why [ disfm arker] why don’t we do t hat .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ fh|s] : Um , t he new m icrophones , t he t wo new ones are in .

m e011 [ fh|s] : Um . [ pause] And t hey are being assem bled as we
speak , I hope .
m e011 [ s^ cc] : And I didn’t bring m y car t oday so I ’m gonna pick t hem
up t om orrow .
m e011 [ fh|s] : Um , and t hen t he ot her quest ion I was t hinking about is
[ disfm arker] well , a couple t hings .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : First of all , if t he ot her headset s are a lot m ore
com fort able , we should probably just go ahead and get t hem .
m e011 [ s] : So we ’ll have t o evaluat e t hat when t hey com e in ,
m e011 [ s] : and get people ’s opinions on [ disfm arker] on what t hey
t hink of t hem .
m n014 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e011 [ fh|s^ cs] : Um , t hen t he ot her quest ion I had is m aybe we
should get anot her wireless .
m e011 [ s^ e] : Anot her wireless set up .
m e011 [ s^ df] : I m ean it ’s expensive , but it does seem t o be [ pause]
bet t er t han t he wired .
m e013 [ qw] : So how m any channels do you get t o have in a wireless
set up ?
m e011 [ h|s] : Um , well , I ’m pret t y sure t hat you can daisy − chain
t hem t oget her
m e011 [ s] : so what we would do is replace t he wired m ikes wit h
wireless .
m e011 [ s] : So we current ly have one base st at ion wit h six wireless
m ike ,
m e011 [ s] : possibilit y of six wireless receivers ,
m e011 [ s] : and apparent ly you can chain t hose t oget her .
m e011 [ s] : And so we could replace our wired m ikes wit h wireless if we
bought anot her base st at ion and m ore wireless m ikes .
m e013 [ %−] : So , um .
m e011 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : So let ’s see we [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : So , y ou know it ’s st ill , it ’s fift een m inus six .
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e011 [ s] : So we could have up t o nine .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : And right now we can hav e up t o six .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : And we have five , we ’re get t ing one m ore .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : And it ’s um , about nine hundred dollars for t he base
st at ion ,
m e011 [ s] : and t hen eight hundred per channel .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So y eah so t he only [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu] : Beyond t he m ike [ disfm arker] t he cost of t he m ikes
t he only t hing is t he base st at ion t hat ’s nine hundred dollars .

m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ co] : Oh , we should do it .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ cc] : OK , so I ’ll look int o how you daisy − chain t hem and
[ disfm arker] and t hen just go ahead and order t hem .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : I don’t quit e underst and how t hat [ disfm arker] how t hat
works , .
m e018 [ %−−] : If [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu] : So we ’re not increasing t he num ber of channels .
m e011 [ s^ ar|s] : No , we ’re just replacing t he wired [ disfm arker] t he
t wo wired t hat are st ill working ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e011 [ s] : along wit h a couple of t he wired t hat aren’t working , one
of t he wired t hat ’s not working , wit h a wireless .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−] : Basically we found [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu] : Three wireds work ,
m e018 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e011 [ s^ na] : I [ disfm arker] I guess t hree wireds work , yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ t c] : But we ’ve had m ore problem s wit h t hat .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ s] : And t hat sort of by passes t he whole [ disfm arker] t he
whole Jim box t hing and all t hat .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : And so um , we [ disfm arker] we seem t o have uh , a
reliable way of get t ing t he dat a in , which is t hrough t he ra Sony radio
m ikes ,
m e013 [ s] : as long as we ’re conscious about t he bat t eries .
m e013 [ s] : That seem s t o be t he key issue .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ qy^ rt ] : Everyone ’s bat t ery OK ?
m e018 [ s] : I checked t hem t his m orning ,
m e018 [ s^ na] : t hey should be .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , [ v ocalsound] That ’s t he only t hing wit h t hem .
m e013 [ s] : But t he qualit y seem s really good
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ fh|s] : Um I heard from UW t hat t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re
uh v ery close t o get t ing t heir , uh set up purchased .
m e013 [ s] : They ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re buying
som et hing t hat y ou can just sort of buy off t he shelf .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : Well we should t alk t o t hem about it because I know
t hat SRI is also in t he process of looking at st uff ,
m e011 [ s] : and so , you know , what we should t ry t o keep everyone
[ disfm arker] on t he sam e page wit h t hat .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : SRI ,
m e018 [ qy^ bh^ rt ] : really ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : They got sa apparent
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Well , Maybe [ pause] t his needs t o be bleeped out ?
m e011 [ s^ no] : I have no clue .
m e013 [ h|s^ no] : Uh , I don’t know .
m e011 [ s^ no] : I don’t know how m uch of it ’s public .
m e013 [ s^ ng] : Probably we shouldn’t [ disfm arker] probably we
shouldn’t t alk about funding st uff .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ t c] : But anyway t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s [ disfm arker]
t here ’s uh , uh ot her act ivit ies t hat are going on t here and
[ disfm arker] and uh [ disfm arker] and NIST and UW .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um . But [ disfm arker] but yeah I t hin I t hink t hat at least
t he m essage we can t ell ot her people is t hat our experience is
[ disfm arker] is quit e posit ive wit h t he Sony ,
m e013 [ s] : uh , radio − m ikes .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ t c] : Now t he one t hing t hat you have said t hat act ually
concerns m e a lit t le is you ’re t alking about changing t he headset s
m e013 [ s] : m eaning changing t he connect or , which m eans som e
hand − soldering or som et hing ,
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d^ g] : right ?
m e011 [ h|s^ ar] : Uh , no ,
m e013 [ qy ^ bh^ m ^ rt ] : No ?
m e011 [ s] : we ’re having t he [ disfm arker] t hem do it .
m e011 [ s] : So it ’s so hand − soldering it , but I ’m not doing it .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ bu] : So , t hey [ disfm arker] t hey charge
m e013 [ s] : Not hing against you and y our hand − soldering
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right .
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]

m e011 [ s] : You ’ve never seen m y hand − soldering .
m e011 [ s] : But uh , a as I said t hey ’re com ing in .
m e013 [ fh|s^ bs^ t c.%−−] : Uh , OK , so t hat ’s being done professionally
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fh] : I m ean .
m e013 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aap] : As professionally as I guess you can get it done .
m e013 [ s^ arp.%−−] : Well , it could [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : if t hey do a lot of it , it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : I m ean i it ’s just t heir repair shop .
m e011 [ qy ^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e011 [ s] : Their m aint enance people .
m e013 [ s] : Well , we ’ll see what it [ disfm arker] it ’s like .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ s] : That [ disfm arker] t ha t hat can be quit e good .
m e013 [ %−−] : Th − t his [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , OK .
m e013 [ fg] : Good .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ co] : So let ’s go wit h t hat .
m e013 [ fg] : Uh ,
m e011 [ s] : And , I m ean we ’ll see , t om orrow , you know , what it looks
like .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So , um , uh , Dave isn’t here but he was going t o st art
working on som e t hings wit h t he digit s .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , so he ’ll be int erest ed in what ’s going on wit h t hat .
m e013 [ %−−] : I guess [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : Was [ disfm arker] t he decision last t im e was t hat
t he [ disfm arker] t he uh t ranscribers were going t o be doing st uff wit h
t he digit s as well ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qr.%−−] : Has t hat st art ed , or is t hat [ disfm arker] ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : Uh , it would be t o use his int erface and I was going t o m eet
wit h him t oday about t hat .
m e011 [ s^ bk|fg|s] : Right , so , t he decision was t hat Jane did not want
t he t ranscribers t o be doing any of t he paperwork .
m e011 [ s] : So I did t he [ disfm arker] all t hat last week .
m e011 [ s] : So all t he [ disfm arker] all t he form s are now [ pause] on
t he com put er .
m e011 [ s] : And uh , t hen I have a bunch of script s t hat we ’ll read
t hose and let t he uh [ pause] t ranscribers use different t ools .

m e011 [ s] : And I just want t o t alk t o Jane about how we t ransit ion t o
using t hose .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So he has a nice set up t hat t hey [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : it w it will be efficient for t hem t o do t hat .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ %−] : So anyway [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t t hink it ’ll t ake t oo long .
m e011 [ s^ e] : So , y ou know , just uh , a m at t er of a few days I
suspect .
m e013 [ s] : So anyway I t hink we [ disfm arker] we have at least one uh ,
user for t he digit s once t hey get done , which will be Dave .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : I ’ve already done fiv e or six [ pause] set s .
fe008 [ b.%] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : So if he want ed t o , you know , just have a few t o st art
wit h , he could .
m e013 [ s.%−] : Yeah , he m ight [ disfm arker] he m ight be asking
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : You know , and I also have a bunch of script s t hat will , like
, generat e P − files and run recognit ion on t hem also .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ fg|qy^ rt .%−] : Uh , is Dave [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ no] : I don’t know if Dav e is on t he list ,
m e013 [ s^ e.%−−] : if he ’s invit ed t o t hese m eet ings ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh
fe008 [ s] : I don’t t end t o get an invit at ion m yself for t hem even .
m e013 [ s^ e^ rt .%−−] : if he knows .
m n014 [ s^ ar.%] : No , no .
m e011 [ fg|s] : Uh , we don’t hav e a act ive one
m e011 [ s^ cc] : but I ’ll m ake sure he ’s on t he list .

m n014 [ fg|s.%−] : Yeah , he was in [ pause] s
fe008 [ s.%−−] : He wasn’t t here at cof

m e013 [ s] : Yeah , so t his m ight be a conflict for him .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ fg|%−−] : Uh , so .
m e011 [ qy ^ bu] : Yeah didn’t he say his signal − processing class was
like [ pause] Tuesday s and Thursdays ?
m n014 [ s^ na] : I t hink he has a class .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ na] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ am ] : He m ight have .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n009 [ qy^ bu^ rt ] : You t alking about Dav id Gelbart ?
m e011 [ s^ by] : Oh well , what ever .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n009 [ s] : Yeah , I t hink he ’s t aking t wo t went y − five A which is now .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n009 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : So , t hat ’s why we ’re not seeing him .
m e013 [ fh] : OK .
m e013 [ fh|s^ t ^ t c] : Uh , t ranscript ions , uh , beyond t he digit s , where
we are , and so on .
fe008 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ t ] : And t he [ disfm arker] and t he recordings also ,
fe008 [ fg] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : just where we are .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ h|qr.%−−] : Well , so um , should we [ disfm arker] we don’t wan
wanna do t he recording st at us first , or [ disfm arker] ?
m e011 [ fg|s] : Well , we have about t hirt y − t wo hours
m e011 [ h|s] : uh as of , I guess a week and a half ago ,
m e011 [ s] : so we probably now have about t hirt y − five hours .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And [ disfm arker] and t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s uh
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : How m uch of t hat is digit s ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : It ’s uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu] : t hat ’s including digit s ,
m e011 [ s^ m ^ na] : That ’s including digit s .

m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e013 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : I hav en’t separat ed it out so I have no clue how m uch of
t hat is digit s .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So any way t here ’s at least probably t hirt y hours ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : or som et hing of [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : There ’s got t o be m ore t han t hirt y hour [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−] : i it couldn’t [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy^ bu^ rt ] : Of [ disfm arker] of non − digit s ?
m e013 [ s^ m ^ na] : of [ disfm arker] Of non − digit s .
m n014 [ b] : Mm m .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , absolut ely .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah , yeah .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , t he digit s don’t t ake up t hat m uch t im e .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ fg|s.%−−] : OK , and t he t ranscribers h
fe008 [ s] : I , uh , don’t have t he ex act num bers ,
fe008 [ s.x ] : but I [ pause] t hink it would com e t o about eleven hours
t hat are finished uh , t ranscribing from t hem right now .
fe008 [ s.x ] : The nex t st ep is t o [ disfm arker] t hat I ’m working on is t o
insure t hat t he dat a are clean first , and t hen channelized .
fe008 [ s.x ] : What I m ean by clean is t hat t hey ’re spell − checked ,
fe008 [ s.x ] : t hat t he m ark − up is consist ent all t he way t hroughout ,
fe008 [ s.x ] : and also t hat we now incorporat e t hese addit ional
conv ent ions t hat uh , Liz request ed in t erm s of um , um [ pause] in
t erm s of having a s a syst em at ic handling of num bers , and acronym s
which I hadn’t been specific about .
fe008 [ h|s] : Um , for exam ple , i t hey ’ll say uh " ninet y − t wo " .
fe008 [ s.%−] : And y ou know , so how [ disfm arker] you could
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Nine t wo ,
fe008 [ s^ bk] : e Exact ly .
m e011 [ b] : right .
fe008 [ s] : So if you just say " nine t wo " , t he [ disfm arker] t here are
m any s ways t hat could have been expressed .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : An − and I just had t hem [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I m ean , a cert ain num ber of t hem did put t he
words down ,
fe008 [ s] : but now we have a convent ion which also involves having it
followed by , um , a gloss t h and t hings .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ g] : You know , Jane ?
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : Um , one suggest ion
m e018 [ s^ df] : and you m ay already be doing t his ,

m e018 [ s.%−−] : but I ’ve not iced in t he past t hat when I ’ve gone
t hrough t ranscript ions and you know in [ disfm arker] in order t o build
lex icons and t hings ,
m e018 [ s.%−] : if you um , just t ake all t he t ranscript ions and separat e
t hem int o words and t hen alphabet ize t hem , [ com m ent ] a lot of t im es
just scanning down t hat list you ’ll find a lot of [ pause] inconsist encies
and m is
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Misspelled .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : You ’re t alking about t he t ype t oken frequency list ings , and
I use t hose t oo .
fe008 [ s^ bu] : Y y ou m ean just uh [ pause] on each [ disfm arker] on
each line t here ’s a one word
fe008 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
fe008 [ s] : It ’s one t oken from t he [ disfm arker] from t he corpus .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : Yeah , t hose are e ext rem ely efficient
fe008 [ s^ ba] : and I and I [ disfm arker] I agree t hat ’s a very good use
of it .
m e018 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh so you already have t hat ,
m e018 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a way [ disfm arker] t hat
’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : You know , t he spell − check basically does t hat
fe008 [ s.%−−] : but [ disfm arker] but in addit ion [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : yes , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s exact ly t he st rat egy I wanna
do in t erm s of locat ing t hese t hings which are you know colloquial
spoken form s which aren’t in t he lexicon .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ b] : Ex act ly .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : Cuz a lot of t im es t hey ’ll appear next t o each ot her ,
and uh ,
fe008 [ s.%−] : And t hen you ca t hen you can do a s
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : i in alphabet ized list s , t hey ’ll appear next t o each ot her
and [ disfm arker] and so it m akes it easier .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Absolut ely .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : I agree .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s a very good [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a very good uh ,
suggest ion .
fe008 [ s] : And t hat was [ disfm arker] t hat ’s m y st rat egy for handling a
lot of t hese t hings , in t erm s of t hings t hat need t o be glossed .
fe008 [ s] : I didn’t get t o t hat point
fe008 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : So t here are num bers , t hen t here are acronym s ,

fe008 [ s] : and t hen um , t here ’s a [ disfm arker] he she want s t he uh ,
act ually a [ disfm arker] an explicit m arker of what t ype of com m ent t his
is ,
fe008 [ s] : so i curly b inside t he curly bracket s I ’m gonna put eit her "
VOC " for vocalized ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : like cough or like laugh or what ever ,
fe008 [ s] : " NONVOC " for door − slam ,
fe008 [ s] : and " GLOSS " for t hings t hat have t o do wit h [ disfm arker] if
t hey said a s a spoken form wit h t his [ disfm arker] m t his pronunciat ion
error .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : I already had t hat convent ion
fe008 [ s] : but I [ disfm arker] I hav en’t been asking t hese people t o do
it sy st em at ically
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Oh t hat ’s great .
fe008 [ s] : cuz I t hink it m ost [ disfm arker] ha m ost efficient ly handled
by uh [ disfm arker] by a [ disfm arker] a filt er .
fe008 [ s] : That was what I was always planing on .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So t hat , you know you get a whole long list [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : exact ly what you ’re saying ,
fe008 [ s] : you get a whole list of t hings t hat say " curly bracket laugh
curly bracket " ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : t hen y you know it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : You [ disfm arker] you risk less error if you handle it by a
filt er , t han if you hav e t his t ranscriber ch laboriously t yping in sort of a
VOC space ,
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : so m an So m any ways t hat error prone .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : So , um , [ vocalsound] um I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m going t o
conv ert t hat via a filt er , int o t hese t agged uh , subcat egorized
com m ent s ,
fe008 [ s] : and sam e t hing wit h you know , we see you get a subset
when y ou do what y ou ’re saying ,
fe008 [ s] : y ou end up wit h a s wit h uh , y ou ’re collapsing across a
frequency you just have t he t okens
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : and you can um , hav e a filt er which m ore efficient ly m akes
t hose changes .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : But t he num bers and acronym s have t o be handled by hand
,
fe008 [ s^ df.%−−] : because , you know I m ean , jus
m e011 [ s^ 2] : You don’t know what t hey could be .

fe008 [ fg|s] : Yeah now TIMIT ’s clear um [ pause] and PLP is clear
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : but uh t here are t hings t hat are not so well known , in
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : or [ disfm arker] or have variant [ disfm arker] u u uses like
t he num bers y ou can say " nine t wo " or you can say " ninet y − t wo " ,
fe008 [ fh] : and uh
m e011 [ qw.%−−] : So how are y ou doing t he [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I ’d handle t he num bers individually .
m e011 [ qw] : How are you doing t he uh , acronym s so if I say PZM what
would it appear on t he t ranscript ?
fe008 [ s] : It would be separat e [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ e] : The let t ers would be separat ed in space
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : and pot ent ially t hey ’ll have a curly bracket t hing aft erwards
fe008 [ %−−] : e
fe008 [ s^ no] : but I ’m not sure if t hat ’s necessary , clarifying what it
is ,
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : so gloss of [ pause] what ever .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ no^ r] : I don’t know if t hat ’s really necessary t o do t hat .
fe008 [ s] : Maybe it ’s a nice t hing t o do because of it t hen indicat ing
t his is uh , a st ep away from i indicat ing t hat it really is int ent ional t hat
t hose spaces are t here ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : and indicat ing why t hey ’re t here t o indicat e t hat it ’s uh
[ v ocalsound] t he y ou know , [ com m ent ] uh enum erat ed , or i
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : it ’s not a good way of saying [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : but it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s t he [ vocalsound] specific uh way of
st at ing t hese [ disfm arker] t hese let t ers .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : So it sounds good .
fe008 [ s] : And so anyway , t he clean [ disfm arker] t hose are t hose
t hings
fe008 [ s] : and t hen channelized is t o t hen um , get it int o t his
m ult ichannel form at .
fe008 [ s] : And at t hat point t hen it ’s ready for use by Liz and Don .
fe008 [ s] : But t hat ’s been m y t op priorit y [ disfm arker] beyond get t ing
it t anel channelized ,
fe008 [ s] : t he next st ep is t o work on t ight ening up t he boundaries of
t he t im e bins .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Right .

fe008 [ s] : And uh , Thilo had a [ disfm arker] e e a breakt hrough wit h
t his [ disfm arker] t his last week in t erm s of get t ing t he channel − based
um uh s s speech − nonspeech segm ent at ion um , up and running
fe008 [ s] : and I haven’t [ disfm arker] I hav en’t been able t o use t hat
y et
fe008 [ s^ df.%−−] : cuz I ’m working
fe008 [ %−−] : s re
fe008 [ s] : t his is m y t op priorit y [ disfm arker] get t he dat a clean , and
channelized .
m n014 [ s.%−] : I act ually gave
m e011 [ qy^ rt ] : Have you also been doing spot checks , Jane ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Oh yes .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Okay , good .
fe008 [ s] : Well you see t hat ’s part of t he cleaning process .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I spent um
fe008 [ s] : act ually um I have a segm ent of t en m inut es t hat was
t ranscribed by t wo of our t ranscribers ,
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Oh good .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Good .
fe008 [ s] : and I went t hrough it last night , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
alm ost spooky how sim ilar t hese are , word for word .
fe008 [ s] : And t here are som e differences in com m as cuz com m as I
[ disfm arker] I left t hem discret ion at com m as .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ fh|s.%−−] : Uh [ disfm arker] and so
fe008 [ s] : because it ’s not part of our st of our ne needed
conv ent ions .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ fh] : And um ,
fe008 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] so t hey ’ll be a difference in com m as ,
fe008 [ s] : but it ’s word − by − word t he sam e , in [ disfm arker] in huge
pat ches of t he dat a .
fe008 [ s] : And I hav e t t en m inut e st ret ch where I can [ disfm arker]
where I can show t hat .
fe008 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and som et im es it t urns out t hat one of
t hese t ranscribers has a bet t er ear for t echnical jargon ,
fe008 [ s] : and t he ot her one has a bet t er ear for colloquial speech .
fe008 [ s] : So um , t he one i i t he colloquial speech person picked up "
gobbledy − gook " .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s] : And t he ot her one didn’t .
fe008 [ s] : And on t his side , t his one ’s picking up t hings like " neural

t he uh colloquial didn’t .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ %−−] : When [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ qw] : for t he person who m issed " gobbledy − gook " what did
t hey put ?
fe008 [ s] : It was an int erest ing approxim at ion , put in parent heses ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : cuz I have t his convent ion t hat , i if t hey ’re not sure what
it was , t hey put it in parent heses .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So t hey t ried t o approxim at e it , but it was [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ ba^ rt ] : Oh good .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : it was spelled GABBL [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Sort of how it sounds .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : More of an at t em pt t o [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : I m ean apparent ly it was very clear t o her t hat t hese
[ disfm arker] t he a t his [ disfm arker] t his was a sound [ disfm arker]
t hese are t he sounds ,
m e011 [ s] : It was a t echnical t erm t hat she didn’t recognize ,
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ fg] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : But she knew t hat she didn’t know it .
fe008 [ s^ na.%−−] : Maybe it was a t echnical t er
fe008 [ s^ aa] : exact ly .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : But she [ disfm arker] even t hough her t echnical
percept ion is just really [ disfm arker] uh you
fe008 [ s] : know I ’v e [ disfm arker] I ’m t em pt ed t o ask her if she ’s
t aken any courses in t his area or if she ’s t aken cognit ive science
courses
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : t hen cuz " neural net s " and [ disfm arker] oh she has som e
t hings t hat are [ disfm arker] oh " downsam pled " , she got t hat right .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s] : And som e of t hese are rat her [ pause] uh unexpect ed .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Obscure ,
m e011 [ b] : y eah .
fe008 [ s] : But ch t en solid uh [ disfm arker] m ch s chunk of t en solid
m inut es where t hey bot h coded t he sam e dat a .
fe008 [ %−] : And um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : And [ disfm arker] and again t he m ain t rack t hat
y ou ’re working wit h is elev eleven hours ?
m e013 [ qy ^ g] : Is t hat right ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes exact ly .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , OK .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And t hat ’s part of t his [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : Elev en hours .

m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t hat [ disfm arker] is t hat [ disfm arker] t hat including
digit s ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes it is .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So let ’s say roughly [ pause] t en hours or so of
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean it ’s probably m ore t han t hat but [ disfm arker] but
wit h [ disfm arker] of [ disfm arker] of non − digit s .
fe008 [ s^ na] : It ’d be m ore t han t hat
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ df] : because I [ disfm arker] m y recollect ion is t he m inut es
[ disfm arker] t hat da digit s don’t t ake m ore t han half a m inut e . Per

m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
fe008 [ s] : But um [ pause] t he [ disfm arker] t he t ot al set t hat I gave
t hem is t welve hours of t ape ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see .
fe008 [ s] : But t hey haven’t got t en t o t he end of t hat yet .
fe008 [ s] : So t hey ’re st ill working [ disfm arker] som e of t hem are
[ disfm arker] Two of t hem are st ill working on com plet ing t hat .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Boy , t hey ’re m oving right along .
fe008 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . They are .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa|s^ ba^ na] : Mm − hm m . They ’re very efficient .
fe008 [ s] : There ’re som e who hav e m ore hours t hat t hey devot e t o it
t han ot hers .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qw^ t c.%−−] : So what [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker] what ’s
t he deal wit h [ disfm arker] wit h your [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : The channel u t hing ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s] : Oh , it ’s just uh , I ran t he recognizer [ disfm arker] uh , t he
[ pause] [ com m ent ] speech − nonspeech det ect or on different

m n014 [ s] : and , it ’s just in uh [ disfm arker] in t his new m ult i − channel
form at and out put ,
m n014 [ s] : and I just gave one [ disfm arker] one m eet ing t o
[ disfm arker] t o Liz who want ed t o [ disfm arker] t o t ry it for [ disfm arker]
for t he recognizer
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see .

m n014 [ s] : as uh , apparent ly t he recognizer had problem s wit h t hose
long chunks of speech , which t ook t oo m uch m em ory or what ever ,
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s] : and so [ pause] she [ disfm arker] she will t ry t hat I t hink
m n014 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m working on it .
m n014 [ s.%−−] : So , I hope [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t his anyt hing different t han t he HMM syst em you

m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ s] : The basic t hing is t his HMM base .
m e011 [ s^ bu] : So t here ’s st ill no [ disfm arker] no knowledge using
different channels at t he sam e t im e .
m e011 [ qy ^ f] : You know what I m ean ?
m n014 [ s] : There is som e , uh as t he energy is norm alized across
channels
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Across all of t hem .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n014 [ fh] : So .
m n014 [ s] : But basically t hat ’s one of t he m ain changes .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qw] : What are som e of t he ot her feat ures ? Besides t he
energy ?
m e013 [ s] : You said you ’re t rying som e different feat ures , or
som et hing .
m n014 [ s] : Oh I just uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] Mm m , I just use um
our loudness − based t hings
m n014 [ s.%−] : now as t hey [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s.%−] : before t here were [ disfm arker] t hey were som e in
[ disfm arker] in t he log dom ain and I [ disfm arker] I changed t his t o t he
[ disfm arker] t o t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ 2^ bu^ rt ] : Cu − Cube root ?
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s.%−−] : To [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ aa^ bsc|s.%−−] : No , I changed t his t o t he [ disfm arker] t o
t he [ disfm arker] t o t he loudness t hingy wit h t he [ disfm arker] wit h t he
m e011 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Ah .
m n014 [ qw^ rt ] : how do you call it ?

m n014 [ s^ no] : I ’m not sure .
m n014 [ s.%−−] : Wit h t he , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Flet cher Munson ?
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n014 [ s^ no] : I ’m not sure about t he t erm .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n014 [ s^ cc] : Uh , I ’ll look it up .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , alright .
m n014 [ s] : And say it t o you .
m n014 [ fh] : Uh , OK , and [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s basically t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t he t hing .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m n014 [ fg|s] : Yeah , and I [ disfm arker] and I t ried t t o norm alize uh
[ disfm arker] uh t he feat ures , t here ’s loudness and m odified loudness
, um , wit hin one channel ,
m n014 [ s] : because t hey ’re , [ vocalsound] yeah t o [ disfm arker] t o be
able t o dist inguish bet ween foreground and background speech .
m n014 [ s] : And it works quit e well .
m n014 [ s] : But , not always .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n014 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m e011 [ b] : Good .
m e013 [ fh] : Um , let ’s see .
m e013 [ %−−] : I t hink t he uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qr^ t c.%−] : Were [ disfm arker] were you basically done wit h
m e013 [ s^ t ^ t c] : t he t ranscript ion part ? So I guess t he next t hing is
t his uh [ disfm arker] bleep edit ing .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : So t he [ disfm arker] The idea is t hat we need t o have
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : We need t o provide t he t ranscript s t o every part icipant of
ev ery m eet ing t o give t hem an opport unit y t o bleep out sect ions t hey
don’t want .
m e011 [ s] : So I ’ve writ t en a bunch of t ools t hat will generat e web
pages , uh wit h t he t ranscript ion in it so t hat t hey can click on t hem
and piece [ disfm arker] pieces and t hey can scroll t hrough and read
t hem ,
m e011 [ s] : and t hen t hey can check on each one if t hey want it
ex cluded .
m e011 [ s] : And t hen , it ’s a form , HTML form , so t hey can subm it it
and it will end up sending m e em ail wit h t he t im es t hat t hey want
ex cluded .

m e011 [ s] : And so , uh , som e of t he quest ions on t his is what do we
do about t he priv acy issue .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : And so I t hought about t his a lit t le bit and I t hink t he best
way t o do it is ev ery part icipant will have a password ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : a single password .
m e011 [ s] : Each person will have a single password , user nam e and
password .
m e011 [ s] : And t hen each m eet ing , we ’ll only allow t he part icipant s
who were at t hat m eet ing t o look at it .
m e011 [ s] : And t hat way each person only has t o rem em ber one
password .
m e013 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I can’t help but wonder if t his is m aybe a lit t le
m ore elaborat e t han is needed .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean if people have [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , for m e I would act ually want t o have som e pieces
of paper t hat had t he t ranscript ion and I would sort of flip t hrough it .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen [ pause] um [ pause] if I t hought it was OK , I ’d
say " it ’s OK " .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And , I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh [ disfm arker] I m ean it depends how t his really ends
up working out ,
m e013 [ s] : but I guess m y t hought was t hat t he occasion of
som ebody wondering whet her som et hing was OK or not and needing
t o list en t o it was gonna be ext rem ely rare .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ df] : Right , I m ean so t h t h t h t he fact t hat you could
list en t o it over t he web is a m inor t hing t hat I had already done for
[ pause] ot her reasons .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : And so t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a m inor part of it ,
m e011 [ s] : I just want ed som e web int erface so t hat people
[ disfm arker] you didn’t act ually have t o send everyone t he t ext .
m e011 [ s] : So m what m y int ent ion t o do is t hat as t he t ranscript s
becom e ready , um [ pause] I would t ake t hem , and generat e t he web
pages
m e011 [ s] : and send em ail t o every part icipant or cont act t hem using
t he cont act m et hod t hey want ed ,
m e011 [ s] : and just uh , t ell t hem , " here ’s t he web page " ,
m e011 [ s] : um , " you need a password " .
m e011 [ qw] : So t h t h quest ion num ber one is how do we dist ribut e
t he passwords ,
m e011 [ qw] : and quest ion num ber t wo is how else do we wanna
prov ide t his inform at ion if t hey want it .
m e013 [ %−−] : That ’s [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s.%−−] : I t hink what I was sort of saying is t hat if you just say
[ v ocalsound] " here is a [ disfm arker] here is [ disfm arker] "
m e013 [ s:qy ] : I m ean t his m aybe it sounds paleolit hic but [ disfm arker]
but I just t hought if you handed t hem som e sheet s of paper , t hat said
, uh , " here ’s what was said in t his t ranscript ion is it OK wit h you ?
m e013 [ s] : and if it is , here ’s t his ot her sheet of paper t hat you sign
t hat says t hat it ’s OK " .
m e011 [ s] : I t hink t hat um t here are a subset of people who will want
print out s t hat we can cert ainly provide .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen t hey ’d hand it back t o you .
m e011 [ s] : But cert ainly I wouldn’t want a print out .
m e011 [ s] : These are big ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : and I would m uch rat her be [ pause] ha be able t o just
sit and leaf t hrough it .
m e013 [ qy.%−−] : You find it easier t o go t hrough a large [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw] : I m ean how do y ou read books ?
m e011 [ s] : Well I cert ainly read books by hand .
m e011 [ s] : But for som et hing like t his , I t hink it ’s easier t o do it on
t he web .
m e013 [ qy^ bh^ rt ] : Really ?
m e013 [ s.%−] : I m ean , it [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Cuz you ’re gonna get , you know , if I [ disfm arker] I ’m
[ disfm arker] I ’m in a bunch of m eet ings and I don’t wanna get a st ack
of t hese .
m e011 [ s] : I wanna just be able t o go t o [ disfm arker] go t o t he web
sit e [ com m ent ] and v isit it as I want .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Going t o a web sit e is easy ,
m e013 [ s^ nd] : but flipping t hrough a hundred pounds [ disfm arker] a
hundred pages of st uff is not easy on t he web .
m e011 [ s^ df^ ng] : Well , I don’t t hink it ’s t hat m uch harder t han ,
paper .
fe008 [ s] : I hav e one quest ion .
m e013 [ qy^ bh^ rt ] : Really ?
m e011 [ fh] : So .
fe008 [ qy^ rt ] : So are you t hinking t hat um t he person would have a
t ranscript and go st rict ly from t he t ranscript ?
fe008 [ s^ df.%−] : Because I [ disfm arker] I do t hink t hat t here ’s a
benefit t o being able t o hear t he t one of voice and t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So here ’s t he way I was im agining it , and m aybe I ’m
wrong ,
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : but t he way I im agined it was t hat um , t he largest set of
people is gonna go " oh yeah , I didn’t say anyt hing funny in t hat
m eet ing
m e013 [ s^ co] : just go ahead ,
m e013 [ qw] : where ’s t he [ disfm arker] where ’s t he release ? "

m e013 [ s] : And t hen t here ’ll be a subset of people ,
m e013 [ qy ^ f^ rt ] : right ? [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : OK t here ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ co] : I m ean t hink of who it is we ’ve been recording m ost ly .
m e013 [ s] : OK t here ’ll be a subset of people , who um , will say uh "
well , y eah , I really would like t o see t hat . "
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And for t hem , t he easiest way t o flip t hrough , if it ’s a
really large docum ent ,
m e013 [ s] : I m ean unless you ’re searching .
m e013 [ s] : Searching , of course , should be elect ronic ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but if you ’re not [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : so if you provide som e search m echanism you go t o every
place t hey said som et hing or som et hing like t hat ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : but see t hen we ’re get t ing m ore elaborat e wit h t his t hing
.
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um if [ disfm arker] if uh you don’t have search
m echanism s you just sort of hav e t his really , really long docum ent ,
m e013 [ s] : I m ean whenever I ’ve had a really , really long docum ent
t hat it was sit t ing on t he web , I ’v e alway s ended up print ing it out .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , so it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , you [ disfm arker] you ’re [ disfm arker] you ’re not
necessarily gonna be sit t ing at t he desk all t he t im e ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : you wanna figure you have a t rain ride , and t here ’s all
t hese sit uat ions where [ disfm arker] where I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , t his is how I was im agining it , anyway .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen I figured , t hat out of t hat group , t here would be
a subset who would go " hm m y ou know I ’m really not sure about t his
sect ion here , "
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and t hen t hat group would need it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : S It seem s like i
m e013 [ s] : if I ’m right in t hat , it seem s like you ’re set t ing it up for
t he m ost infrequent case , rat her t han for t he m ost frequent case .
m e013 [ s] : So t hat uh , now we have t o worry about privacy ,
m e011 [ s^ nd.%−] : Well , no fre for t he m ost [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : we have t o worry about all t hese passwords , for different
people
m e011 [ s^ nd] : For t he m ost frequent case t hey just say [ pause] " it ’s
OK "
m e011 [ s] : and t hen t hey ’re done .
m e011 [ s] : And I t hink [ pause] alm ost ev eryone would rat her do t hat
by em ail t han any ot her m et hod .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ %−] : The ot her t hing t oo is it seem s like [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ h|s^ aa] : Um , yeah , t hat ’s t rue .

fe008 [ s^ co] : Go ahead .
m e011 [ s^ df] : I m ean , cuz you don’t have t o visit t he web page if you
don’t want t o .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : I guess [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ am ] : Yeah , I guess we don’t need t heir signat ure .
m e013 [ s] : I guess an em ail OK is alright .
m e011 [ s] : Oh t hat was anot her t hing
m e011 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I had assum ed t hat we didn’t need t heir
signat ure , t hat it [ disfm arker] t hat an em ail approval was sufficient .
m e011 [ s^ no] : But [ pause] I don’t act ually know .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Are [ disfm arker] are people going t o be allowed t o
bleep out sect ions of a m eet ing where t hey weren’t speaking ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe008 [ %−] : I also [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : If som eone feels st rongly enough about it , t hen I
[ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hey should be allowed t o do t hat .
fe008 [ b] : m m − hm m .
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ rt ] : So t hat m eans ot her people are edit ing what you
say ?
m e013 [ s^ nd^ no] : Uh [ pause] I don’t know about t hat .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ no] : I don’t know if I like t hat .
m e011 [ s^ df] : Well , t he only ot her choice is t hat t he person would
say " no , don’t dist ribut e t his m eet ing at all " ,
m e011 [ s] : and I would rat her t hey were able t o edit out ot her people
t hen just say " don’t dist ribut e it at all " .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : But t h what t hey signed in t he consent form , was
som et hing t hat said you can use m y voice .
m e011 [ s] : Well , but if [ disfm arker] if som eone is having a
conv ersat ion , and y ou only bleep out one side of it , t hat ’s not
sufficient .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ ng] : Yeah , but t hat ’s our decision t hen .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e011 [ h|s^ nd] : Um , I don’t t hink so .
m e013 [ s^ nd] : I t hink it is .
m e011 [ s.%−] : I m ean , because if I object t o t he conversat ion .
m e011 [ s] : If I say " we were having a conversat ion , and I consider
t hat conversat ion privat e , " and I consider t hat your side of it is
enough for ot her people t o infer , I wanna be able t o bleep out your
side .
fe008 [ %−−] : The [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I agree t hat t he consent form s were [ disfm arker] uh , I
cons

fe008 [ s] : agree wit h what Adam ’s saying , t hat [ vocalsound] um , t he
consent form did leav e open t his possibilit y t hat t hey could edit t hings
which t hey found offensive whe whet her t hey said t hem or didn’t say
t hem .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ s] : OK , well , if t hat ’s what it said .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And t he ot her t hing is from t he st andpoint of t he l of t he
l
fe008 [ s] : I ’m not a law lawyer ,
fe008 [ s] : but it st rikes m e t hat [ vocalsound] uh , we wouldn’t want
som eone t o say " oh yes , I was a lit t le concerned about it
fe008 [ s] : but [ v ocalsound] it was t oo hard t o access " .
fe008 [ s] : So I t hink it ’s kind of nice t o have t his facilit y t o list en t o it .
fe008 [ s] : Now [ disfm arker] in t erm s of like edit ing it by hand , I m ean I
t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] i som e people would find t hat easier t o specify
t he bleep part by having a docum ent t hey edit ed .
fe008 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but it seem s t o m e t hat som et im es um ,
y ou know i if a person had a bad day , and t hey had a t one in t heir
v oice t hat t hey didn’t really like , you know it ’s nice [ disfm arker] it ’s
nice t o be able t o list en t o it and be sure t hat t hat was OK .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : I m ean I can cert ainly provide a print able version if
people want it .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Um [ pause] I m ean it ’s also a m ixt ure of people ,
m e011 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean som e people are r do t heir work prim arily by sit t ing
at t he com put er , flipping around t he web ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : and ot hers do not .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Ot hers would consider it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : t his uh [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a set of skills t hat t hey
would have t o gain .
m e013 [ qy^ f] : You know ?
m e011 [ s] : Well I t hink m ost of t he people in t he m eet ings are t he

m e013 [ s] : It depends on what m eet ings .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : That ’s t rue .
m e018 [ s^ aap] : So far .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s^ aap] : In t he m eet ings so far , yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e013 [ s] : But we ’re t rying t o expand t his ,
m e013 [ qy ^ f] : right ?
m e011 [ s^ aa^ m ] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : So I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I act ually t hink t hat paper is
t he m ore universal t hing .
m e011 [ %−] : And t hat [ disfm arker]

fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ ng] : Well , but if t hey want t o print it out t hat ’s alright .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : I t hink everyone in t he m eet ing can access t he web .
m e013 [ s^ nd] : No , I t hink we have t o be able t o print it out .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s not just if t hey want t o print it out .
m e011 [ s^ bk|qy ^ rt ] : OK , so does t hat m ean t hat I can’t use em ail ?
m e013 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qrr] : Or what ?
fe008 [ s] : Cuz you could send it t hrough em ail you ’re t hinking .
m e013 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker] I t h
m e013 [ %−] : well [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.%−] : Well , I don’t t hink I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−] : t here was t his [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : well I don’t t hink we can send t he t ext t hrough em ail

fe008 [ s^ aa] : Good .
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No .
fe008 [ qy ^ 2^ bu] : For securit y ?
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , OK good .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Good point .
m e011 [ fh|qy^ bu] : Um . So giving t hem , you t hink a web sit e t o say , "
if y ou wanna print it out here it is " , is not sufficient ?
fe008 [ b.%] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ %−] : I
m e013 [ s^ arp] : Cert ainly for everybody who ’s been in t he m eet ings
so far it would be sufficient .
m e013 [ s.%−] : I ’m just wondering about [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah , I ’m just t hinking for people t hat t hat ’s not
sufficient for , what [ disfm arker] t he only sufficient t hing would be for
m e t o walk up t o t hem and hand it t o t hem .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : You could m ail it t o t hem .
fe008 [ s^ cs^ e] : Get an a m ailing address .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ ng] : Equivalent .
fe008 [ s] : But I t hink it ’s easier t o drop in t he box .
m n014 [ fg] : But [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ cs] : Just put t he but t on on [ disfm arker] on t he web page
which say " please send m e t he [ disfm arker] t he script s " .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Oh t hat ’s int erest ing .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right .
m n014 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qw.%−−] : What um [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ qw] : When y ou display it on t he web page , what are

m e011 [ s^ e] : Whole ut t erances only .

m e011 [ s.%−−] : And t hat was just convenience for m y sake , t hat it ’s
uh , uh
m e011 [ s] : it would end up being fairly difficult t o edit t he t ranscript s if
we would do it at t he sub − ut t erance level .
m e011 [ s] : Because t his way I can just delet e an ent ire line out of a

m e013 [ s^ t c] : There ’s anot her aspect t o t his which m aybe
[ disfm arker] is part of why t his is bot hering m e .

[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ fe] : Really .
m e013 [ s^ df] : You ’re gonna end up wit h all t hese lit t le pat chy t hings
, whereas really what we want t o do is have t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t he bias t owards let t ing it go .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Because nob you
m e013 [ s.%−−] : know it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : There was a [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : one or t wi once or t wice , in t he re in t he m eet ings we ’ve
heard , where som ebody said som et hing t hat t hey m ight be
em barrassed by ,
m e013 [ s] : but overall people are t alking about t echnical t opics .
m e013 [ s] : Nobody ’s gonna get hurt .
m e013 [ s] : Nobody ’s being l libeled .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : You know , t his is [ disfm arker] t his [ disfm arker] we ’re
[ disfm arker] we ’re covering [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : We ’re playing t he lawy er ’s gam e , and we ’re playing we
’re [ disfm arker] we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re looking for t he ext rem e case
.

m e013 [ s] : If we really orient it t owards t hat ext rem e case , m ake it
really easy , we ’re gonna end up encouraging a headache .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : That [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I ’m sort of psyching m yself out here ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] I ’m t rying t o [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : but I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ng] : I guess I don’t see hav ing a few phrases here and
t here in a m eet ing being t hat m u m uch of a headache , bleeped out .
m e013 [ s^ nd.%−] : Well , it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ %−] : but i
m e018 [ s^ bs] : I t hink what Morgan ’s say ing is t he easier it is , t he
m ore is gonna be bleeped .
m e013 [ s^ df] : And [ disfm arker] and it really depends on what kind of
research y ou ’re doing .
m e013 [ s^ df] : I t hink som e researchers who are gonna be working
wit h t his corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing t he fact
t hat t here ’s a bunch of st uff in t here [ com m ent ] t hat ’s m issing from
t he dialogue .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ r] : You know , it depends on t he kind of research t hey ’re
doing ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : but it m ight be , uh [ pause] it m ight be really a
[ disfm arker] a pain .
m e013 [ s] : And , y ou know where it ’s really gonna hurt som ebody , in
som e way [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : t he one who said it or som eone who is being spoken
about , [ com m ent ] we definit ely want t o allow t he opt ion of it being
bleeped out .
m e013 [ s] : But I really t hink we wanna m ake it t he rare incidence .
m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and uh , I am just a lit t le worried about
m aking it so easy for people t o do ,
m e013 [ s] : and so m uch fun ! [ v ocalsound] t hat t hey ’re gonna go
t hrough and bleep out st uff .
fe008 [ s^ m ] : So m uch fun .
m e013 [ s] : and t hey can bleep out st uff t hey don’t like t oo ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right
m e013 [ s] : from som ebody else , as y ou say ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : y ou know , so " well I didn’t like what he said . "
m e011 [ s^ nd] : Well I don’t see any way of avoiding t hat .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , we have t o provi we have prom ised t hat we would
prov ide t hem t he t ranscript and t hat t hey can rem ove part s t hat t hey
don’t like .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s.%−] : So t hat t he [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s^ bsc.%−] : No , no , I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I don’t
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.%−] : The only quest ion is [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : You − y ou ’ve t alked m e int o t hat ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : but I [ disfm arker] I just t hink t hat we should m ake it
harder t o do .
m e011 [ s^ df^ ng] : The problem is if it ’s harder for t hem it ’s also
harder for m e .
m e011 [ s] : Whereas t his web int erface , I just get em ail ,
m e011 [ s] : it ’s all form at t ed ,
m e011 [ s] : it ’s all ready t o go and I can just insert it .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : So m aybe you don’t give t hem access t o t he web
int erface unless t hey really need it .
fe008 [ s.%−] : Well I guess [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker] so [ disfm arker] so
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ fa] : I ’m sorry [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : so [ disfm arker] so [ disfm arker] So m aybe t his is a s a way
out of it .
fe008 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s] : You ’v e provided som et hing t hat ’s useful for you t o do
[ disfm arker] handle ,
m e013 [ s] : and useful for som eone else if t hey need it .
m e013 [ s] : But I t hink t he issue of privacy and ease and so fort h
should be t hat uh , t hey get access t o t his if t hey really need it .
m e011 [ %−] : Well [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu] : So y ou ’re saying t he [ disfm arker] t he sequence would
be m ore like first Adam goes t o t he cont act list s , cont act s t hem via
what ev er t heir preferred m et hod is , t o see if t hey want t o review t he
m eet ing .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e018 [ s] : And t hen if t hey don’t , you ’re done .
m e018 [ s] : If t hey do , t hen he provides t hem access t o t he
[ disfm arker] t he web sit e .
m e013 [ %−] : W w
m e011 [ s] : Well , t o som e ext ent I have t o do t hat anyway because as
I said we have t o dist ribut e passwords .
m e018 [ s] : Or [ disfm arker] a print ed − out form .
m e013 [ %−] : There ’s [ disfm arker] t here [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−] : y
m e011 [ fh] : So ,
m e013 [ s^ nd] : but you don’t necessarily have t o dist ribut e passwords
is what I ’m say ing .
m e013 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ %−] : Well , but [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ e] : Only if t hey want it .

m e011 [ s] : what I ’m saying is t hat I can’t just em ail t hem t he
password because t hat ’s not secure .
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No , no , no .
m e013 [ s.%−] : But y ou aren’t necessarily giving t hem [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : So t hey have t o call m e and ask .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] we don’t even necessarily need t o end up
dist ribut ing passwords at all .
m n014 [ b.%] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e011 [ s^ na] : Well , we do because of privacy .
m e011 [ s^ e] : We can’t just m ake it openly available on t he web .
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No , no .
m e013 [ s] : You ’re m issing t he point .
fe008 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : We ’re [ disfm arker] We ’re t rying i We ’re t rying t o m ake it
less of an obvious just l l l l uh fall off a log , t o do t his .
fe008 [ s^ bs] : Not everyone get s a password , unless t hey ask for it .
m e013 [ qy ^ f^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : So t h so what I would see , is t hat first you cont act
t hem and ask t hem if t hey would like t o review it for t o check for t he
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : not just for fun ,
m e013 [ qy ^ f] : OK ?
m e013 [ s] : but t o [ disfm arker] t o check t his for uh t hings t hat t hey ’re
worried about hav ing said or if t hey ’re willing t o just send an approval
of it , at [ disfm arker] from t heir m em ory .
m e013 [ fh|s^ cs] : Um [ disfm arker] and , uh , and we should t hink
carefully act ually we should rev iew [ disfm arker] go t hrough how t hat ’s
worded ,
m e013 [ qy^ f^ rt ] : OK ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Then , if som eone uh [ disfm arker] want s t o review it ,
uh ,
m e013 [ s^ df|s^ cs] : and I know you don’t like t his , but I ’m offering
t his as a suggest ion , is t hat [ disfm arker] is t hat we t hen give t hem a
print out .
m e013 [ s.%−] : And t hen if t hey say t hat " I have a pot ent ial problem
wit h t hese t hings , " t hen , you [ disfm arker] you say " OK well you m ight
wanna hear t his in cont ext t o s t hink if you need t hat , " you issue
t hem a password , i in t he [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ng] : But t he [ disfm arker] t he problem wit h what you ’re
suggest ing is it ’s not just inconvenient for t hem , it ’s inconvenient for
me .
m e011 [ s^ df] : Because t hat m eans m ult iple cont act s every t im e
[ disfm arker] for ev ery single m eet ing every t im e anyone want s anyt hing
.

m e011 [ s^ cs^ df] : I would m uch prefer t o have all be aut om at ic , t hey
v isit t he web sit e if t hey want t o .
m e011 [ s] : Obviously t hey don’t have t o .
m e013 [ s^ aap|s^ arp.%−] : I know y ou ’d prefer it , but t he proble
m e013 [ %−] : we hav e [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : t here ’s a problem wit h it .
m e011 [ s] : So I t hink you ’re t hinking people are going t o arbit rarily
st art bleeping and I just don’t t hink t hat ’s gonna happen .
fe008 [ s] : I ’m also concerned about t he spirit of t he [ disfm arker] of
t he inform ed consent t hing .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Cuz I t hink if t hey feel t hat uh , it ’s [ disfm arker] I t h I t h
fe008 [ s] : You know , if it t urns out t hat som et hing get s published in
t his corpus t hat som eone really should have elim inat ed and didn’t
det ect , t hen it could have been because of t heir own negligence t hat
t hey didn’t pursue t hat next level and get t he password and do t hat ,
fe008 [ fh|s] : um , but [ disfm arker] but t hey m ight be able t o argue "
oh well it was cum bersom e , and I was busy and it was gonna t ake m e
t oo m uch t im e t o t race it down " .
fe008 [ s^ df] : So it could t hat t he burden would com e back ont o us .
fe008 [ s] : So I ’m a lit t le bit worried about uh , m aking it harder for
t hem , from t he legal st andpoint .
m e013 [ s^ ng] : Well you can go t oo far in t hat direct ion , and you
need t o find som ewhere bet ween I t hink ,
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−] : because [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : It seem s t o m e t hat sending t hem em ail , saying " if you
have an O − OK reply t o t his em ail and say OK ,
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e011 [ s] : If you have a problem wit h it cont act m e and I ’ll give you a
password " ,
m e011 [ s] : seem s like is a perfect ly , reasonable com prom ise .
m e011 [ s] : And if t hey want a print out t hey can print it out t hem selves
.
fe008 [ s^ cs] : Or we could print it up for t hem ,
fe008 [ s^ cs] : I m ean we could offer t hat [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] but t here ’s uh , anot her aspect t o t hat
and t hat is t hat in t he inform ed consent form , um , m y im pression is
t hat t hey [ disfm arker] t hat we offered t hem at t he very least t hat t hey
definit ely would hav e access t o t he t ranscript .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And [ disfm arker] and I ha
fe008 [ s^ no] : I don’t know t hat t here ’s a chance of really skipping
t hat st age .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .

fe008 [ s.%−−] : I m ean I [ disfm arker] I t hought t hat you were
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−] : May be I m isint erpret ed what you said but it ’s
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Hav ing access t o it doesn’t necessarily m ean , t hat
[ disfm arker] hav ing it
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Having it .
fe008 [ s^ 2] : Giv ing it t o t hem .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : It just m eans t hey have t he right t o have it .
m e011 [ %−−] : Well t he in [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Alright .
m e011 [ s] : t he consent form is right in t here if anyone want s t o look
at it ,
fe008 [ b] : Fine .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Fair enough .
m e011 [ fh] : so .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ %−−] : Sh − sh
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : D y ou want m e t o grab one ?
fe008 [ %−−] : well I could [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ng] : I ’m closer .
fe008 [ %−] : I could [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ arp] : Yeah , but y ou ’re wired
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : aren’t you ?
fe008 [ b.%] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : That is t rue .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Um . [ vocalsound] Yeah , I m ean I don’t wanna fool t hem
,
fe008 [ s^ no.%−] : I don’t know [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I just m eant t hat e every [ disfm arker] ev any t im e you say
anyt hing t o anyone t here is in fact a [ disfm arker] a bias t hat is

fe008 [ s^ aa] : Oh y eah yeah [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : oh I know .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah t hat ’s t rue .
m e013 [ %−] : of [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : " If y ou agree t o part icipat e y ou ’ll have t he opport unit y t o

fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .

m e011 [ s] : " Once a t ranscript is available we will ask your perm ission

m e011 [ s] : and t hey will m be rem oved bot h from t he t ranscript and
t he recording . "
fe008 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Well t hat ’s m ore open t han I realized .
m e011 [ %−−] : Well , I m ean it [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : The one quest ion is definit ely clear wit h anyt hing as

m e013 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−] : Yeah , uh no t hat [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] t ha
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Tha − t hat ’s t rue .
fe008 [ s] : That ’s m ore severe , but t he next one says t he t ranscript
will be around .
m e013 [ b] : t hat ’s right .
fe008 [ s] : And it doesn’t [ com m ent ] really say we ’ll send it t o you ,
fe008 [ s] : or wi it ’ll be available for you on t he web , or anyt hing .
m e018 [ s^ na] : I t hink it probably leav es it open how we get it t o t hem
.
m e013 [ %−] : I I [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : At least it m ore oft en .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : It m eans also we don’t have t o g To give it t o t hem .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I m ean like [ disfm arker] like Morgan was saying t hey
[ disfm arker] t hey [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : They just have t o m ake sure t hat it is available t o t hem .
fe008 [ s^ bk^ m ] : It ’s available t o t hem if t hey ask for it .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , OK ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : so . wh um [ disfm arker] I t hink I have an idea t hat m ay
be sat m ay sat isfy bot h you and m e in t his which is , um ,
m e013 [ s] : it ’s a [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] we just go over carefully
how t hese not es t o people are worded .
m e013 [ s^ e] : So I [ disfm arker] I just want it t o be worded in such a
way where it giv es t he st rong im pre it giv es very , I m ean not hing
hidden , v very st rongly t he bias t hat we would really like t o use all of
t hese dat a .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ e] : That [ disfm arker] t hat we really would rat her it wasn’t a
pat chwork of t hings t ossed out ,
fe008 [ b] : Good .
m e013 [ s^ e] : t hat it would be bet t er for , um , our , uh , field if t hat is
t he case .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But if you really t hink som et hing is gonna [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s] : And I don’t t hink t here ’s anyt hing in t he legal aspect s t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat is hurt by our expressing t hat bias .
fe008 [ b] : Great .
fe008 [ b] : Great , great .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t hen [ disfm arker] t hen m y concern about
[ disfm arker] which [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : I agree .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : y ou know you m ight be right , it m ay be it was just
paranoia on m y part , uh but people just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : See I ’m @ @ worried about t his int erface so m uch fun
[ v ocalsound] t hat people st art bleeping st uff out [ com m ent ]
[ v ocalsound] just as [ disfm arker] just because t hey can .
m e011 [ s^ ng] : It ’s just a check box next t o t he t ext , it ’s not any fun
at all .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ no] : Well I don’t know .
m e013 [ s^ nd] : I kind of had fun when you played m e som et hing t hat
was bleeped out .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g] : You know .
m e013 [ %−−] : I
m e011 [ s] : Well , but t hey won’t get t hat feedback .
m e011 [ %−] : All [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy^ bh] : Oh t hey won’t ?
m e011 [ s^ ar|s^ df] : no because it doesn’t aut om at ically bleep it at
t he t im e .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Oh good .
m e011 [ s.%−] : It just sends m e [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So you haven’t m ade it so m uch fun .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Oh good .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e011 [ s] : It just sends m e t he t im e int ervals .
m e011 [ s] : And t hen at som e point I ’ll incorporat e t hem all and put
bleeps .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean I don’t wanna have t ha do t hat yet unt il we act ually
release t he dat a
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : because um , t hen we have t o have t wo copies of every
m eet ing
m e011 [ s] : and we ’re already short on disk space .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So I [ disfm arker] I wanna [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] just
keep t he t im es unt il we act ually wanna release t he dat a and
m e011 [ s] : t hen we bleep it .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : Alright , so I t hink [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Yeah so if we have if [ disfm arker] i
m e013 [ s] : Again let ’s you know , sort of circulat e t he [ disfm arker]
t he wording on each of t hese t hings and get it right ,
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Well since you seem t o feel heart uh , st rongest about
it , would you like t o do t he first pass ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , fair enough .
m e013 [ s] : Turn about is fair play ,
fe008 [ s] : Al − Also it t her t here is t his ot her quest ion , t he legal

need a concret e signat ure , or em ail c i suffices or what ever
m e013 [ s^ fa.x] : Sorry .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ no] : and I don’t know how t hat works .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : i There ’s som et hing down t here about " if you agree t o
[ disfm arker] "
m e013 [ s] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m [ disfm arker] I
t hought [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I t hought about it wit h one of m y
background processes
m e011 [ s^ nd] : I don’t t hink so .
m e013 [ s] : and I [ disfm arker] uh it ’s [ disfm arker] uh it ’s uh , it ’s fine
t o do t he em ail .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Ah .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Fine .
fe008 [ b] : Good .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah because t hi t h t hey ’re signing here t hat t hey ’re
agreeing t o t he paragraph which say s " you ’ll be given an opport unit y
."
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : And so I don’t t hink t hey need anot her signat ure .
m e013 [ s^ e.%−−] : Well and furt herm ore I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : it ’s now fairly rout ine in a lot of arrangem ent s t hat I do
wit h people on cont ract s and so fort h
m e013 [ s] : t hat [ disfm arker] t hat uh if it ’s [ disfm arker] if it ’s t hat sort
of t hing where y ou ’re you ’re say ing uh " OK I agree , we want eight y
hours of t his person at such − and − such am ount , and I agree t hat ’s
OK , "
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh if it ’s a follow up t o som e ot her agreem ent where
t here was a signat ure it ’s oft en done in em ail now
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : so it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s OK .

fe008 [ b] : Great .
m e013 [ %−] : Um .
m e011 [ s] : So I guess I probably should at t he m inim um , t hink about
