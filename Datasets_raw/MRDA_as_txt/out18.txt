m e011 [ z] : and t here was one hypot hesis t hat perhaps t hat
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] t he act of recording t he VU m et er was one
of t he t hings t hat cont ribut ed t o t he errors .
fe008 [ z] : Oh .
fe008 [ z] : Oh , I see .
m e028 [ z] : Yeah , but Eric , uh , you didn’t t hink t hat was a reasonable

m e028 [ z] : Oh , I ’m sorry y

m e011 [ z] : I t hought t hat was [ disfm arker]

m e011 [ z] : Well , t he only reason t hat could be is if t he driver has a
bug .
m e011 [ z] : Right ?
m e011 [ z] : Because t he m achine just isn’t very heavily loaded .
m e028 [ z] : No chance of t hat .
m e011 [ z] : No chance of t hat .
m e011 [ z] : Just because it ’s bet a .
m e025 [ z] : Yeah , t here [ disfm arker] t here [ disfm arker] t here was
[ disfm arker] t here was a [ disfm arker] t here was a bug .
m e011 [ z] : Look OK ?
m e025 [ z] : There was a glit ch last t im e we ran .
m e028 [ z] : Are − are yo are you recording where t he t able m ikes are by
t he way ?
m e028 [ z] : Do you know which channels [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ z] : No .
m e011 [ z] : Yeah , we usually do t hat .
m e025 [ z] : No , we don’t .
m e011 [ z] : Yeah .
m e028 [ z] : Why not ?
m e025 [ z] : But we [ disfm arker] we ought t o st we ought t o st andardize
.
m e025 [ z] : I t hink , [ vocalsound] uh , I s I spoke t o som ebody , Morgan
, [ com m ent ] about t hat .
m e028 [ z] : Why don’t you just do t his ?
m e025 [ z] : I t hink [ disfm arker] I t hink we should put m ar Well , no , w
we can do t hat .
m e011 [ z] : I m ean , t hat ’s what we ’ve done before .
m e025 [ z] : I know what t hey [ disfm arker] t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re
four , t hree , t wo , one .
m e025 [ z] : In order now .
m e028 [ z] : Four .
m e025 [ z] : Three ,
m e028 [ z] : Three .
m e025 [ z] : t wo , [ v ocalsound] and one .
m e025 [ z] : But I t hink [ disfm arker] I t hink we should put t hem in
st andard posit ions .
m e025 [ z] : I t hink we should m ake lit t le m arks on t he t able t op .
fe008 [ z] : Oh , OK .
m e011 [ z] : Which m eans we need t o m ove t his t hing , and sort a
decide how we ’re act ually going t o do t hings .
m e025 [ z] : So t hat we can put t hem [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ z] : I guess t hat ’s t he point .
m e011 [ z] : So .

m e025 [ z] : It ’ll be a lot easier if we hav e a [ disfm arker] if we have
t hem perm anent ly in place or som et hing like t hat .
m e011 [ z] : Right .
fe008 [ z] : I do wish t here were big boom s com ing down from t he

m e028 [ z] : Wait t ill t he project or get s inst alled .
m e011 [ z] : That ’ll work .
fe008 [ z] : Oh , t hat ’ll be good .
m e011 [ z] : That ’ll work .
fe008 [ z] : OK .
m e025 [ z] : Oh , gosh .
m e028 [ z] : Cuz it ’s gonna hang down , m ake noise .
m e025 [ z] : When ’s it gonna be inst alled ?
fe008 [ z] : OK .
m e028 [ z] : Well , [ vocalsound] it depends on
m e025 [ z] : I see .
m e028 [ z] : Is t his b is t his being recorded ?
m e011 [ z] : That ’s right .
m e028 [ z] : Uh , I t hink Lila act ually is alm ost get t ing r pret t y close t o

m e028 [ z] : I handed it off t o her about a m ont h ago .
m e025 [ z] : I see .
m e011 [ fg] : OK ,
m e011 [ fg] : so ,
m e011 [ s^ rt ^ t ] : t opic of t his m eet ing is I wanna t alk a lit t le bit about
t ranscript ion .
m e011 [ fh|s] : Um , I ’ve looked a lit t le bit int o com m ercial t ranscript ion
serv ices
m e011 [ s] : and Jane has been working on doing t ranscript ion .
m e011 [ fh|s^ t ] : Uh , and so we wan wanna decide what we ’re gonna
do wit h t hat
m e011 [ s^ t ] : and t hen get an updat e on t he elect ronics ,
m e011 [ s^ cs^ t ] : and t hen , uh , m ay be also t alk a lit t le bit about
som e infrast ruct ure and t ools , and so on .
m e011 [ fh|s^ df] : Um , you know , event ually we ’re probably gonna
wanna dist ribut e t his t hing

m e011 [ s^ cs] : and we should decide how we ’re gonna [ disfm arker]
how we ’re gonna handle som e of t hese fact ors .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e025 [ qw^ d] : Dist ribut e what ?
m e011 [ qw^ br^ rt ] : Hm m ?
m e025 [ s] : The dat a ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ aa^ r] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , so we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re collect ing a corpus
m e011 [ s] : and I t hink it ’s gonna be generally useful .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , it seem s like it ’s not a corpus which is
[ disfm arker] uh , has been done before .
m e025 [ b] : Oh .
m e011 [ s] : And so I t hink people will be int erest ed in hav ing
[ disfm arker] hav ing it ,
m e028 [ qy^ d] : u Using , like , audio D V Ds or som et hing like t hat ?
m e011 [ s.%−] : and so we will [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ b] : Yes .
m e011 [ qw^ br] : Excuse m e ?
m e028 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : Audio D V
m e011 [ h|s^ aap] : Well , or som et hing .
m e011 [ s^ na] : Yeah , audio D V
m e011 [ s] : C Ds ,
m e028 [ %] : Or t
m e011 [ fh] : you know .
m e028 [ b] : Yeah .
m e028 [ s] : t apes .
m e011 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and so how we do we dist ribut e t he
t ranscript s ,
m e011 [ s] : how do we dist ribut e t he audio files ,
m e011 [ s] : how do we [ disfm arker] how do we just do all t hat
infrast ruct ure ?
m e022 [ h|s] : Well , I t hink [ disfm arker] I m ean , for t hat part icular
issue t her t here are known sources where people go t o [ disfm arker] t o
find t hese kind of t hings like t he LDC for inst ance .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
fe008 [ s^ aa] : t hat ’s right .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right ,
m e011 [ qy] : but [ disfm arker] but so should we do it in t he sam e
form at as LDC
m e011 [ qw] : and what does t hat m ean t o what we ’ve done already ?
m e025 [ b] : Right .
m e025 [ %−] : The [ disfm arker]

m e022 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ fh] : So , uh ,
m e011 [ s] : as it is , it ’s sort of a [ pause] ad − hoc com binat ion of st uff

m e011 [ s^ e] : which we m ay wanna m ake a lit t le m ore form al .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e025 [ s] : And t he ot her t hing is t hat , um , Universit y of Washingt on
m ay want t o st art recording m eet ings as well ,
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e025 [ s] : in which case w w we ’ll have t o decide what we ’ve act ually

m e028 [ s] : A field t rip .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : That ’s right .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : I was act ually t hinking I wouldn’t m ind spending t he

m e011 [ s^ ba] : That would be kind of fun .
m e025 [ qy^ bh] : Oh , really ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s] : Different for you .
m e011 [ s^ df.%−−] : Visit m y friends and spend som e t im e [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ b] : Yes .
m e011 [ s] : Well , and t hen also I have a bunch of st uff for doing t his
digit s .
m e011 [ s^ df] : So I have a bunch of script s wit h X Waves , and som e
Perl script s , and ot her t hings t hat m ake it really easy t o ext ract out
[ v ocalsound] and align where t he digit s are .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : And if U d UW ’s going t o do t he sam e t hing I t hink it ’s
wort h while for t hem t o do t hese digit s t asks as well .
m e028 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ df] : And what I ’ve done is pret t y ad − hoc ,

t hat we have so far .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : That ’s t rue .

m e022 [ s^ nd] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s not great .
m e028 [ %] : Tr
fe008 [ s^ df.%−] : well but what I m ean is t hat , um [ disfm arker]

respect ed in t he linguist ics d side t oo and t he discourse area ,
fe008 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e022 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : So t his is a very good corpus .
m e022 [ s^ df.%−−] : But , it uh it would also m aybe help be helpful for Liz

looking at som e of t his dat a and t hen ,
m e022 [ fh] : y ou know [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e022 [ s^ cs] : So when she get s here m aybe t hat m ight be a good

issues relat ed t o discourse t hat she needs t o get m arked .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .

[ disfm arker] uh , Liz and Andreas seem t o be around m ore oft en .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e022 [ s^ cs] : So m aybe we should find a day when t hey ’re gonna be
here and [ disfm arker] and Morgan ’s gonna be here ,
m e022 [ s^ cs] : and we can m eet ,
m e022 [ s^ e] : at least t his subgroup .
m e022 [ s^ df] : I m ean , not necessarily have t he U − dub people down .
m e011 [ s^ cs.%−] : Well , I was even t hinking t hat m aybe we need t o at

m e022 [ s] : We need [ disfm arker] we need t o t alk t o t hem som e m ore .
m e011 [ s:s] : y ou know , say " t his is what we ’re t hinking about for our
t ranscript ion " , if not hing else .
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e011 [ qy ^ rt ^ t ] : So , well w shall we m ove on and t alk a lit t le bit
about t ranscript ion t hen ?
m e022 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s^ na] : Let ’s .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e011 [ s] : so [ com m ent ] [ vocalsound] since t hat ’s what we ’re
t alking about .
m e011 [ s] : What we ’re using right now is a t ool , um , from t his
French group , called " Transcriber "
m e011 [ s] : t hat seem s t o work very well .
m e011 [ fh] : Um ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : so it has a , uh , nice useful Tcl − TK user int erface
m e011 [ fh] : and , uh ,
m e028 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : Thi − t his is t he process of convert ing audio t o t ext ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e028 [ qy^ d] : And t his requires hum ans just like t he [ disfm arker] t he
STP st uff .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yes ,
m e011 [ s^ aa] : yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right , right .
m e011 [ s] : So we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re at t his point only looking for
word level .
m e011 [ s] : So all [ disfm arker] all [ disfm arker] so what you have t o do
is just ident ify a segm ent of speech in t im e , and t hen writ e down what
was said wit hin it ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : and ident ify t he speaker .
m e011 [ s] : And so t he t hings we [ disfm arker] t hat we know
[ disfm arker] t hat I know I want are [ vocalsound] t he t ext , t he st art
and end , and t he speaker .
m e011 [ s] : But ot her people are int erest ed in for exam ple st ress
m arking .
m e011 [ s^ e] : And so Jane is doing prim ary st ress , [ vocalsound] um ,
st ress m arks as well .
m e011 [ s] : Um , and t hen t hings like repairs , and false st art s , and ,
[ v ocalsound] filled pauses , and all t hat ot her sort of st uff ,
[ v ocalsound] we have t o decide how m uch of t hat we wanna do .
fe008 [ s] : I did include a glo [ com m ent ] uh , a cert ain first pass .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : My [ disfm arker] m y view on it was when you have a
repair [ v ocalsound] t hen , uh [ disfm arker] it seem s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , we saw , t here was t his present at ion in t he
[ disfm arker] one of t he speech group m eet ings about how
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : and I t hink Liz has done som e st uff t oo on t hat , t hat it ,
uh [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] t hat you get it bracket ed in t erm s of like
[ disfm arker]

fe008 [ s] : well , if it ’s parent het ical , which I know t hat Liz has worked
on , t hen [ v ocalsound] uh [ disfm arker] y y you ’ll have different
prosodic aspect s .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e025 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s] : And t hen also [ vocalsound] if it ’s a r if it ’s a repair where
t hey ’re [ disfm arker] like what I just did , [ vocalsound] t hen it ’s nice t o
have sort of a sense of t he cont inuit y of t he ut t erance ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : t he st art t o be t o t he finish .
fe008 [ fh|s^ ba] : And , uh , it ’s a lit t le bit decept iv e if you include t he
repai t he pre − repair part [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ e] : and som et im es or of it ’s in t he m iddle .
fe008 [ fg|s] : Anyway , [ vocalsound] so what I was doing was
bracket ing t hem t o indicat e t hat t hey were repairs
fe008 [ s^ e] : which isn’t uh , very t im e − consum ing .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e028 [ qy ^ rt ] : I is t here already som e sort of plan in place for how
t his gonna be st affed or done ?
m e028 [ qrr] : Or is it real [ disfm arker] is t hat what we ’re t alking about
here ?
m e011 [ h] : Well ,
m e011 [ s^ aap] : t hat ’s part of t he t hing we ’re t alking about .
m e011 [ s^ df] : So what we want ed t o do was have Jane do basically
one m eet ing ’s wort h ,
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ e] : y ou know , fort y m inut es t o an hour ,
fe008 [ s] : As a pilot st udy .
m e011 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ qy ^ d] : Yourself ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
fe008 [ s^ df] : as a pilot st udy .
m e028 [ s^ bu] : It [ disfm arker] t his is [ disfm arker] t his is like five t im es
real t im e or t en t im es real t im e [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Ten t im es about ,
m e011 [ s] : is [ disfm arker] and so one of t he t hings was t o get an
est im at e of how long it would t ake ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : and t hen also what t ools we would use .
m e011 [ s] : And so t he next decision which has t o be m ade act ually
pret t y soon is how are we gonna do it ?
m e028 [ s] : And so y ou m ake Jane do t he first one
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e028 [ s:s] : so t hen she can decide , oh , we don’t need all t his st uff
,
m e028 [ s:s] : just t he words are fine .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right ,

fe008 [ s^ aa^ r] : t hat ’s right .
m e025 [ b] : That ’s right .
fe008 [ s.%−] : I wanna hear about t hese [ disfm arker] uh , we have a g
y ou were s cont inuing wit h t he t ranscript ion convent ions for s
m e011 [ s^ bk] : R right ,
m e011 [ s] : so [ disfm arker] so one [ disfm arker] one opt ion is t o get
linguist ics grad st udent s and undergrads t o do it .
m e011 [ s^ df] : And apparent ly t hat ’s happened in t he past .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : And I t hink t hat ’s probably t he right way t o do it .
m e011 [ fh|s] : Um , it will require a post pass ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : I m ean people will have t o look at it m ore t han once t o
m ake sure t hat it ’s been done correct ly ,
m e011 [ s] : but I just can’t im agine t hat we ’re gonna get anyt hing t hat
m uch bet t er from a com m ercial one .
m e011 [ s] : And t he com m ercial ones I ’m sure will be m uch m ore
ex pensiv e .
m e028 [ qy^ rt ] : Can’t we get Joy t o do it all ?
fe008 [ s^ ar|%−−] : No , [ vocalsound] t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ng] : Yeah right .
m e028 [ qy ^ df] : Is t ha wasn’t t hat what she was doing before ?
m e011 [ s^ j] : We will just get Joy and Jane t o do everyt hing .
m e028 [ s^ aa^ j] : Yeah ,
m e028 [ s^ aa^ j] : t hat ’s right .
m e011 [ s] : But , y ou know , t hat ’s what we ’re t alking about is get t ing
som e slav es who [ disfm arker] who need m oney
m e028 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ fh] : and , uh ,
m e011 [ %−] : duh , again o
fe008 [ s^ fe] : I object t o t hat charact erizat ion !
m e025 [ qy ^ bh] : Oh , really .
m e011 [ s^ j] : I m eant Joy .
m e011 [ s:qy ] : And so again , I have t o say " are we recording "
fe008 [ s^ ft ] : Oh , t hank you .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s:s] : and t hen say , uh , Morgan has [ disfm arker] has
consist ent ly resist ed t elling m e how m uch m oney we have .
m e028 [ b] : Right .
m e028 [ s] : Well , t he answer is zero .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e028 [ s^ j] : There ’s a reason why he ’s resist ed .
m e028 [ fh] : But .
m e011 [ s] : Well , if it ’s zero t hen we can’t do any t ranscript ion .
m e028 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ df.%−−] : I m ean , cuz we ’re [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s^ ba] : I have such a hard nam e .

m e011 [ s^ df] : I m ean , I [ disfm arker] I can’t im agine us doing it
ourselves .
m e028 [ s] : Well , we already [ disfm arker] we already [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] We already have a plan in place for t he first m eet ing .
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e028 [ qy^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : N right .
m e028 [ %] : That ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well t h t here is als
fe008 [ s^ na] : Yeah , really .
fe008 [ s] : There is also t he o ot her possibilit y which is if you can
prov ide not m oney but inst ruct ional ex perience or som e ot her perks ,
[ v ocalsound] you can [ disfm arker] you could get people t o [ disfm arker]
t o um , t o do it in ex change .
m e028 [ s^ ng|s] : Well , i b but seriously , I [ disfm arker] I m ean ,
Morgan ’s obv iously in a bind over t his
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e028 [ s^ cs] : and t hing t o do is just t he field of dream s t heory ,
m e028 [ s^ df] : which is we we go ahead as t hough t here will be m oney
at t he t im e t hat we need t he m oney .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e028 [ s^ ba] : And t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he best we can do .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e028 [ s^ ba] : i b To not do anyt hing unt il we get m oney is
[ disfm arker] is ridiculous .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e025 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e028 [ s^ df] : We ’re not gonna do any [ disfm arker] get anyt hing
done if we do t hat .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fg|s^ rt ] : So at any rat e , Jane was looking int o t he possibilit y
of get t ing st udent s ,
m e011 [ qy ^ g^ rt ] : at [ disfm arker] is t hat right ?
m e011 [ qy ^ d] : Talking t o people about t hat ?
fe008 [ s^ ng] : I ’m afraid I haven’t m ade any progress in t hat front yet
.
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : I should ’ve sent em ail and I haven’t yet .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , right .
m e011 [ fg] : So , uh [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ s.%−] : I d do [ disfm arker] So unt il you act ually [ vocalsound]
have a lit t le ex perience wit h what t his [ disfm arker] t his French t hing
does we don’t even have [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−] : And I do have [ disfm arker]

m e011 [ s^ nd] : She ’s already done quit e a bit .
fe008 [ s^ nd] : I hav e [ disfm arker] a bunch of hours ,
m e028 [ s^ bk] : Oh , we have .
m e028 [ s^ fa] : I ’m sorry .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
m e028 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : So t hat ’s where you cam e up wit h t he f t he t en X
num ber ?
m e028 [ qrr] : Or is t hat really just a guess ?
fe008 [ s] : Act ually t hat ’s t he [ disfm arker] t he one people usually use
, t en X .
fe008 [ s^ df.%−−] : And I haven’t really calculat ed [ disfm arker]
m e022 [ qw] : How fast are you ?
fe008 [ qw^ bk^ rt ] : How fast am I ?
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I haven’t done a
m e028 [ %−] : Yeah i
fe008 [ s.%−−] : s see , I ’ve been at t he sam e t im e doing kind of a boot
st rapping in deciding on t he t ranscript ion convent ions t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat are [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] you know , and
[ disfm arker] and st uff like , you know , how m uch [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ b] : Mm m .
m e022 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : There ’s som e int erest ing hum an fact ors problem s like ,
[ v ocalsound] yeah , what span of [ disfm arker] of t im e is it useful t o
segm ent t he t hing int o in order t o uh , t ranscribe it t he m ost quickly .
fe008 [ s^ e] : Cuz t hen , you know , y ou get like [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] if you get a span of five words , t hat ’s easy .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : But t hen you have t o t ake t he t im e t o m ark it .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : And t hen t here ’s t he issue of [ vocalsound] it ’s easier t o
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] hear it t h right t he first t im e if you ’ve
m arked it at a boundary inst ead of [ vocalsound] som ewhere in t he
m iddle ,
fe008 [ s^ df] : cuz t hen t he word ’s bisect ed or what ever
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ fh] : And
fe008 [ s] : so I m ean , I ’ve been sort of playing wit h , uh , different
way s of m ar cuz I ’m t hinking , you know , I m ean , if you could get
opt im al inst ruct ions you could cut back on t he num ber of hours it
would t ake .
m e028 [ qy.%−−] : D does uh [ disfm arker] t his t ool you ’re using is
st rict ly [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e028 [ s|qy^ d^ g] : it doesn’t do any speech recognit ion does it ?

m e011 [ s^ aa] : No .
fe008 [ s^ na] : No , it doesn’t
fe008 [ s^ ba] : but what a super t ool .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : It ’s a great env ironm ent .
m e028 [ qy] : But [ disfm arker] but is t here anyway t o [ disfm arker] t o
wire a speech recognizer up t o it
m e028 [ s^ e.%−] : and act ually run it t hrough [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s an int erest ing idea .
fe008 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Hey !
m e011 [ s] : We ’ve [ disfm arker] we ’ve t hought about doing t hat
m e011 [ s^ ng] : but t he recognit ion qualit y is gonna be horrendous .
m e028 [ s] : Well , a couple t hings .
m e028 [ s^ df] : First of all t he t im e m arking you ’d get [ disfm arker] you
could get by a t ool .
m e025 [ s^ ba.%] : Wow .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : That ’s t rue .
m e028 [ s.%−−] : And so if t he [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] if t he issue
really
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s int erest ing .
m e028 [ s^ df] : uh , I ’m t hink about t he close capt ion t hat you see
running by on [ disfm arker] on live news cast s .
m e028 [ %−] : You know , yo
m e011 [ s^ ng] : Most of t hose are done by a person .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e028 [ s^ na] : I know [ disfm arker] I know t hat .
fe008 [ %] : I
m e028 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : No , I underst and .
m e028 [ s^ df] : And [ disfm arker] in a lot of t hem you see t ypos and
t hings like t hat ,
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e028 [ s^ cs] : but it [ disfm arker] but it occurs t o m e t hat
[ v ocalsound] it m ay be a lot easier t o correct t hings t han it is t o do
t hings from scrat ch , no m at t er how wonderful t he t ool is .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fg|%−] : Yeah , we [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ s^ cs.%−−] : But if [ disfm arker] if t here was a way t o m erge t he
t wo [ disfm arker]
m e022 [ h|s^ cs^ ng.%−−] : Well , I m ean , but som et im es it ’s easier t o
t y pe out som et hing inst ead of going t hrough and figuring out which is
t he right [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’d be fun .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , we ’ve t alked about it
m e011 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m e022 [ s] : I m ean , it depends on t he error rat e ,
m e022 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?

m e028 [ s] : Well s but [ disfm arker] but again t he t im ing is for fr should
be for free .
m e028 [ s.%−] : The t im ing should be [ disfm arker]
m e022 [ s^ ng] : But we don’t care about t he t im ing of t he words .
m e028 [ s^ bu] : Well I t hought you just [ disfm arker] t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
said t hat was a crit ical issue .
fe008 [ s^ ar] : No ,
m e011 [ s^ nd] : We don’t care about t he t im ing of t he words , just of
t he ut t erances .
fe008 [ s] : uh t he [ disfm arker] t he boundary [ disfm arker]
m e022 [ s.%−] : We cut it s s
m e025 [ s^ no] : We don’t [ disfm arker] we don’t know , act ually .
fe008 [ s^ r] : boundary .
m e025 [ s^ df] : We haven’t decided which [ disfm arker] which t im e we
care about ,
m e025 [ s^ bs] : and t hat ’s kind of one of t he t hings t hat you ’re saying
, is like [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] you have t he opt ion t o put in m ore or
less t im ing dat a [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s] : and , uh , be in t he absence of m ore specific inst ruct ions ,
[ v ocalsound] we ’re t rying t o figure out what t he m ost convenient t hing
t o do is .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah ,
m e011 [ fg|s] : so [ disfm arker] so what [ disfm arker] what she ’s done
so far , is sort of [ disfm arker] m ore or less breat h g not breat h groups
, [ com m ent ] sort of phrases , cont inuous phrases .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fh|s] : And so , um , t hat ’s nice because you [ disfm arker] you
separat e when y ou do an ext ract , you get a lit t le silence on eit her end
.
m e011 [ s] : So t hat seem s t o work really well .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s ideal .
m e011 [ fh] : Um .
fe008 [ s] : Alt hough I was [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] you know , t he
alt ernat ive , which I was sort of experim ent ing wit h before I ran out of
t im e , [ v ocalsound] recent ly was , [ v ocalsound] um [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] t hat , you know , ev if it were like an arbit rary segm ent of
t im e [ disfm arker] i t pre − m arked
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ df] : cuz it does t ake t im e t o put t hose m arkings in .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : It ’s really t he i t he int erface is wonderful
fe008 [ s^ df] : because , you know , t he t im e it t akes is you list en t o it ,
[ v ocalsound] and t hen you press t he ret urn key .
fe008 [ s] : But t hen , you know , it ’s like , [ vocalsound] uh , you press
t he t ab key t o st op t he flow and [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] and , uh ,
t he ret urn key t o p t o put in a m arking of t he boundary .

fe008 [ s] : But , y ou know , obviously t here ’s a lag bet ween when you
hear it and when y ou can press t he ret urn key
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : so it ’s slight ly delayed ,
fe008 [ s] : so t hen y ou [ disfm arker] you list en t o it a second t im e and
m ov e it ov er t o here .
fe008 [ s] : So t hat t akes t im e .
m e028 [ %] : a
m e028 [ fg] : i a
fe008 [ s.%−] : Now if it could all be pre − m arked at som e , [ vocalsound]
l y ou know , good [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ fg] : ar but
m e028 [ qy] : Are [ disfm arker] are t hose d delays adjust able ?
m e011 [ b] : Hm m .
m e028 [ qy^ d^ r] : Those delays adjust able ?
m e028 [ s^ df] : See a lot of people who act ually build st uff wit h hum an
com put er int erfaces [ vocalsound] underst and t hat delay ,
m e028 [ s^ df.%−−] : and [ disfm arker] and so when you [ disfm arker] by
t he t im e y ou click it it ’ll be right on because it ’ll go back in t im e t o put
t he [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
fe008 [ s^ nd] : uh , not in t his case .
m e025 [ s^ na] : It could do t hat
m e025 [ qy ^ g] : couldn’t it .
m e011 [ s] : We could program t hat pret t y easily ,
fe008 [ s.%−] : It has ot her [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy^ g^ rt ] : couldn’t we Dan ?
m e011 [ s^ e^ j] : Yeah , m is Mist er TCL ?
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Oh , int erest ing point .
m e025 [ s^ na] : I would have t hought so ,
m e025 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
fe008 [ s^ ba^ r] : Ah ! [ com m ent ] Int erest ing point .
fe008 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , t hat would m ake a difference .
m e025 [ b] : Mm m .
m e011 [ fg] : But , um [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : I m ean , it ’s not bad
m e011 [ s] : But , if we t ried t o do aut om at ic speaker ID .
fe008 [ s] : but it does [ disfm arker] t ake t wice .
m e011 [ s^ df] : I m ean , cuz prim arily t he m arkings are at speaker
change .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah ,
m e025 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]

m e025 [ s^ ng] : But we ’ve got [ disfm arker] we ’ve got t he m ost
channel dat a .
m e011 [ s.%−] : But t hat would be [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s] : We ’d have t o do it from y our signal .
m e025 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ ba^ fe] : Oh , good point !
m e025 [ s^ df] : I m ean , we ’ve [ disfm arker] we ’ve got [ disfm arker] we
’v e got a lot of dat a .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Ah !
fe008 [ s^ na] : We ’v e got volum e .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , I guess t he quest ion is how m uch t im e will it
really sav e us v ersus t he t im e t o writ e all t he t ools t o do it .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e025 [ s.%−] : but t he chances are if we if we ’re t alking about
collect ing [ vocalsound] t en or a hundred hours , which is going t o t ake
a hundred or a t housand hours t o t ranscribe [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ %−] : If [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg] : But [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ s.%−] : if we can go from t en X t o five X we ’re doing a big
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ df^ ng] : We ’re gonna need [ disfm arker] we ’re gonna need
t en t o a hundred hours t o t rain t he t ools , and validat e t he t ools t he
do t he d t o [ disfm arker] t o do all t his anyway .
m e022 [ b] : Right .
m e022 [ %−] : So m aybe [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Wow .
fe008 [ fg|%−] : But [ disfm arker] but it op
m e025 [ s.%−] : If we ’re just doing silence det ect ion [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : I knew you were gonna do t hat .
m e011 [ s] : Just saw it com ing .
fe008 [ s^ fa] : I ’m sorry .
fe008 [ s] : I wish y ou had t old m e [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ r] : wish you ’d t old m e .
m e028 [ s^ cs] : Put [ disfm arker] put it on y our sweat er .
fe008 [ qw^ d] : At what part ?
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
fe008 [ s] : I ’m alright .
m e025 [ fg|s.%−−] : Um , i it seem s like [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ fh] : Well ,
m e025 [ s^ no] : uh , I don’t know .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s] : I m ean , it [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s m aybe like
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] a week ’s work t o get t o do som et hing like
t his .
m e025 [ s^ e] : So fort y or fift y hours .

fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : Could you get it so t hat wit h [ disfm arker] so it would
[ disfm arker] it would det ect volum e on a channel and insert a m arker ?
m e022 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : And t he [ disfm arker] t he form at ’s really t ransparent .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m e022 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ df.%−−] : It ’s just a m at t er of [ v ocalsound] a very c clear
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : it ’s XML , isn’t it ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : It ’s very [ disfm arker] I m ean , I looked at t he [ disfm arker]
t he file form at and it ’s just [ disfm arker] it has a t a t im e [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] a t im e indicat ion and t hen som et hing or ot her , and t hen
an end t im e or som et hing or ot her .
m e022 [ fg] : So
m e022 [ s^ cs] : m aybe [ disfm arker] m aybe we could t ry t he following
ex perim ent .
m e022 [ s^ cs^ df] : Take t he dat a t hat you ’ve already t ranscribed
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e022 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ qrr] : Is t his already in t he past or already in t he fut ure ?
m e022 [ s] : Already in t he past .
m e028 [ qy^ d] : You ’ve already [ disfm arker] you ’ve already done som e
?
m e022 [ s.%−] : She [ disfm arker] she ’s done one [ disfm arker] she ’s
one [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yes I have .
m e011 [ s^ na] : She ’s [ disfm arker] she ’s done about half a m eet ing .
m e028 [ s^ bk] : Oh − Oh , I see .
m e022 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e028 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e022 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e028 [ s^ ba] : good .
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : About half ?
m e022 [ s.%−] : I ’m go
fe008 [ s^ no] : S I ’m not sure if it ’s t hat ’s m uch
fe008 [ s] : but any way , enough t o work wit h .
m e022 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e025 [ s] : Sev eral m inut es .
m e022 [ fg] : Um ,
m e022 [ s^ cs] : and [ disfm arker] and t hrow out t he words ,
m e022 [ s^ cs] : but keep t he t im e m arkings .
m e022 [ s^ cs] : And t hen go t hrough [ disfm arker] I m ean , and go
t hrough and [ disfm arker] and t ry and re − t ranscribe it , given t hat we
had perfect boundary det ect ion .

fe008 [ s^ aa] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Good idea .
m e022 [ s^ cs] : And see if it [ disfm arker] see if it [ disfm arker] see if it
feels easier t o you .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e028 [ s^ cs.%−] : And forget t ing all t he words because you ’ve been
t hr
fe008 [ s^ bk|s^ na] : Yeah , t hat ’s what I was t hinking .
fe008 [ s] : I ’d [ disfm arker] I ’d be cheat ing a lit t le bit g wit h fam iliarit y
effect .
m e022 [ s^ bk|s^ df^ na] : Yeah , I m ean uh , t hat ’s part of t he problem
is , is t hat what we really need is som ebody else t o com e along .
m e025 [ s^ cs] : Well , no , you should do it [ disfm arker] you should do
it [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] Do it again from scrat ch
m e025 [ s^ cs] : and t hen do it again at t he boundaries .
m e025 [ s^ cs^ j] : So you do t he whole t hing t hree t im es
m e025 [ s.%−] : and t hen we get [ disfm arker]
m e022 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ar] : No .
fe008 [ s] : Now , t here ’s a plan .
m e028 [ s^ cs^ j] : And t hen [ disfm arker] t hen w since we need som e
st at ist ics do it t hree m ore .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e028 [ s^ df^ j] : And so you ’ll get [ disfm arker] you ’ll get down t o one
point t wo X by t he t im e you get done .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh , y eah .
fe008 [ s^ cc^ j] : I ’ll do t hat t om orrow .
fe008 [ s^ j] : I should have it finished by t he end of t he day .
m e028 [ fg|s] : No , but t he t hing is t he fact t hat she ’s [ disfm arker]
she ’s did it before just m ight giv e a lower bound .
m e028 [ s] : That ’s all .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Exact ly .
m e028 [ s^ e] : Uh , which is fine .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e022 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e028 [ %] : It ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e028 [ s^ df] : And if t he lower bound is nine X t hen w it ’s a wast e of
t im e .
m e022 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well , uh but t here ’s an ext ra problem which is t hat I
didn’t really keep accurat e [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ df] : uh , it wasn’t a pure t ask t he first t im e ,
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Oh !
fe008 [ s] : so [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] uh , it ’s gonna be an upper
bound in [ disfm arker] in t hat case .

m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : And it ’s not really st rict ly com parable .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : So I t hink t hough it ’s a good proposal t o be used on a
new [ disfm arker] a new bat ch of t ext t hat I haven’t yet done yet in t he
sam e m eet ing . Could use it on t he nex t segm ent of t he t ext .
m e025 [ qw] : The point we [ disfm arker] where do we get t he
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he oracle boundaries from ?
m e022 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e025 [ s^ e] : Or t he boundaries .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : Yeah , one person would have t o assign t he
boundaries and t he [ disfm arker] and t he ot her person would have t o
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ qy .%−] : Well , but couldn’t I do it for t he next [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s.%−] : We [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] we could get fake
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see what you m ean .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean t hat ’s easy enough .
m e011 [ s] : I could do t hat .
fe008 [ s|qy ^ g^ rt ] : Well , but t he oracle boundaries would com e from
v olum e on a part ic specific channel wouldn’t t hey ?
m e025 [ s] : That would be t he aut om at ic boundaries .
m e022 [ s^ ar] : No , no , no , no .
m e011 [ s^ ar] : No , no .
m e022 [ s.%−−] : You wanna know [ disfm arker] given [ disfm arker] Given
a perfect hum an segm ent at ion , I m ean , y ou wanna know how well
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e022 [ s] : I m ean , t he [ disfm arker] t he quest ion is , is it wort h giving
y ou t he segm ent at ion ?
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see what you m ean .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s easy enough .
m e022 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : I could generat e t he segm ent at ion and [ disfm arker] and
y ou could do t he words , and t im e yourself on it .
m e028 [ s] : A lit t le double − blind − ear kind of t hing .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : I see .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : So it [ disfm arker] t hat m ight be wort h doing .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s good .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : I like t hat .
m e011 [ s^ df] : That would at least t ell us whet her it ’s wort h spending
a week or t wo t ry ing t o get a t ool , t hat will com put e t he
segm ent at ions .

m e028 [ s] : And t he t hing t o keep in m ind t oo about t his t ool , guys is
t hat [ v ocalsound] sure , you can do t he com put at ion for what we ’re
gonna do in t he fut ure
m e022 [ b] : Right .
m e028 [ s] : but if [ disfm arker] if UW ’s t alking about doing t wo , or
t hree , or five t im es as m uch st uff and t hey can use t he sam e t ool ,
t hen obviously t here ’s a real m ult iplier t here .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : And t he ot her t hing t oo is wit h [ disfm arker] wit h speaker
ident ificat ion ,
fe008 [ s] : if [ disfm arker] if t hat could handle speaker ident ificat ion
t hat ’s a big deal .

m e022 [ s^ df] : Cuz it ’s easier .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right ,
m e011 [ s^ df^ na] : t hese are linguist ics grad st udent s .
m e028 [ s^ bk] : That ’s right .

m e011 [ b] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : More .
fe008 [ s^ m ^ na] : m ore .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Uh − huh .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fg|qy ^ d^ rt ] : Um , any m ore on t ranscript we wanna t alk about
?
m e025 [ s^ bu] : What s so what are y ou [ disfm arker] so you ’ve done
som e port ion of t he first m eet ing .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m e025 [ qw] : And what ’s your plan ?
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e025 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : To carry on doing it ?

fe008 [ s.%−−] : What [ disfm arker] Well , you know what I t hought was
right now we hav e p
fe008 [ s] : So I gave him t he proposal for t he t ranscript ion convent ions
.
fe008 [ s] : He m ade his , uh , suggest ion of im provem ent .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : The [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] It ’s a good
suggest ion .
fe008 [ s] : So as far as I ’m concerned t hose t ranscript ion convent ions
are fix ed right now .
fe008 [ s.%−] : And so m y next plan would be [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ qw^ rt ] : What [ disfm arker] what do t hey [ disfm arker] what do
t hey cov er ?
fe008 [ s] : They ’re v ery m inim al .
fe008 [ s] : So , [ v ocalsound] it would be good t o [ disfm arker] just t o
sum m arize t hat .
fe008 [ s^ df] : So , um , [ vocalsound] one of t hem is t he idea of how t o
indicat e speaker change ,
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ df] : and t his is a way which m eshes well wit h [ disfm arker]
wit h , uh , m aking it [ vocalsound] so t hat , uh , you know , on t he
[ disfm arker] At t he [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Boy , it ’s such a nice int erface .
fe008 [ s^ e.%−−] : When you [ disfm arker] when you get t he , um
[ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker] y ou get t he speech signal you also get
[ v ocalsound] down beneat h it , [ vocalsound] an indicat ion of ,
[ v ocalsound] uh ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : if you have t wo speakers ov erlapping in a s in a single
segm ent , you see t hem [ vocalsound] one [ disfm arker] displayed one
above each ot her .
fe008 [ s^ e] : And t hen at t he sam e t im e [ v ocalsound] t he t op s part of
t he screen is t he act ual verbat im t hing .
fe008 [ s^ e] : You can clip [ disfm arker] click on individual ut t erances
and it ’ll t ake you im m ediat ely t o t hat part of t he speech signal , and
play it for you .
fe008 [ s] : And y ou can , eh you can work pret t y well bet ween t hose
t wo [ disfm arker] t hese t wo t hings .
m e028 [ qy^ rt ] : Is t here a lim it t o t he num ber of speakers ?
m e011 [ h|s^ na] : Um , t he user int erface only allows t wo .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Hm m .
m e011 [ s^ df] : And so if [ disfm arker] if you ’re using t heir int erface t o
specify ov erlapping speakers you can only do t wo .
m e011 [ s] : But m y script can handle any .
m e011 [ s] : And t heir save form at can handle any .

m e011 [ fh|s] : And so , um , using t his [ disfm arker] t he convent ion t hat
Jane and I hav e discussed , you can hav e as m any overlapping
speakers as y ou want .
m e028 [ qy^ rt ] : Do y is t his a , uh , univ ersit y project ?
m e028 [ s|qy ^ d^ g] : Th − t his is t he French soft ware , right ?
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah ,
m e011 [ s^ na] : French .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s^ na] : t heir academ ic .
m e011 [ s] : And t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’ve been quit e responsive .
m e028 [ %] : eh
m e011 [ s^ df] : I ’ve been exchanging em ails on various issues .
m e025 [ qy ^ bh] : Oh , really ?
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e028 [ qy ^ rt ] : Uh , did you ask t hem t o change t he int erface for
m ore speakers ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yes ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : and t hey said t hat ’s on [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in
t he works for t he next version .
m e028 [ s^ ba] : Good .
m e028 [ s^ ba] : Good .
m e022 [ s] : Oh , so m ult i m ult ichannels .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : Mult ichannels was also [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Well , t hey said t hey want ed t o do it but t hat t he code is
really very organized around single channels .
m e022 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e011 [ s] : So I t hink t hat ’s n unlikely t o ha happen .
m e022 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e028 [ qy ^ rt ] : Do − do you know what t hey ’re using it for ?
m e028 [ qw^ rt ] : Why ’d t hey develop it ?
m e011 [ qy^ d] : For t his exact t ask ?
m e028 [ qy] : Are t hey linguist s ?
m e022 [ s] : For t ranscript ion .
m e022 [ %] : It ’s [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ qr] : But I m ean , are t hey [ disfm arker] are t hey linguist s or are
t hey speech recognit ion people ?
m e011 [ s] : I t hink t hey ’re linguist s .
fe008 [ %] : Ho
fe008 [ b] : Hm m .
m e025 [ s] : Linguist s .
m e022 [ s] : They ’re [ disfm arker] t hey hav e som e connect ion t o t he
LDC
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e022 [ s^ df] : cuz t he LDC has been advising t hem on t his process ,

m e022 [ s^ e] : t he Linguist ic Dat a Consort ium .
m e028 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e022 [ fh] : Um ,
m e022 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker]
m e022 [ s] : but a apart from t hat .
m e022 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : It ’s also [ disfm arker] All t he source is available .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e022 [ b] : Right .
m e028 [ s^ ba] : Great .
m e011 [ s^ e] : If you [ disfm arker] if you speak TCLTK .
m e028 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : And t hey have [ disfm arker] t hey ’ve act ually asked if we
are willing t o do any developm ent
m e011 [ s:s^ am ] : and I said , well , m aybe .
m e028 [ s^ ba] : Good .
m e022 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : So if we want [ disfm arker] if we did [ disfm arker] if we did
som et hing like program m ed in a delay , which act ually I t hink is a great
idea , um , I ’m sure t hey would want t hat incorporat ed back in .
fe008 [ s^ na] : Yeah , I do t oo .
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e028 [ s] : Their pre pre − lay .
m e025 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Pre − lay .
fe008 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Pre − lay .
m e011 [ s] : Way .
fe008 [ s] : Well , and t hey ’ve t hought about t hings .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : You know , I m ean , t hey [ disfm arker] t hey do have
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : So you hav e [ disfm arker] when you [ disfm arker] when you
play it back , um , it ’s [ disfm arker] it is useful t o have , uh , a
[ disfm arker] a break m ark t o [ disfm arker] se segm ent it .
fe008 [ s] : But it wouldn’t be st rict ly necessary
fe008 [ s^ df] : cuz y ou can use t he [ disfm arker] uh , t he t abbed key t o
t oggle [ vocalsound] t he sound on and off .
fe008 [ s^ df] : I m ean , it ’ll st op t he s speech you know if you if you
press a t ab .
fe008 [ fh] : And , um .
fe008 [ fh] : And so ,
fe008 [ fh|s^ ba] : uh , t hat ’s a nice feat ure .
fe008 [ s] : And t hen also once you ’ve put a break in t hen you have
t he opt ion of [ v ocalsound] cycling t hrough t he unit .
fe008 [ s] : You could do it like m ult iply
fe008 [ s^ e] : unt il you get [ com m ent ] crazy and decide t o st op cycling
t hrough t hat unit .

m e028 [ qy ^ cs^ d^ rt ] : Loop it ?
fe008 [ fh] : Or [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ s] : Yo − you n you know , t here ’s al also t he [ disfm arker] t he
user int erface t hat ’s m issing .
fe008 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ s^ df] : It ’s m issing from all of our offices ,
m e028 [ s^ df] : and t hat is som e sort of analog input for som et hing
like t his .
m e028 [ s] : It ’s what audio people act ually use of course .
m e028 [ s^ df] : It ’s som et hing t hat wh [ v ocalsound] when you m ove
y our hand furt her , t he sound goes fast er past it ,
m e028 [ s^ e] : like fast forward .
m e028 [ s^ e] : You know , like a joy st ick
m e028 [ fh|s^ e] : or a [ disfm arker] uh , y ou could wire a m ouse or
t rackball t o do som et hing like t hat .
fe008 [ %] : Why , t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ nd] : That ’s not som et hing I want ed t o have happen .
m e028 [ s^ bk|s] : No , but I ’m say ing if t his is what professionals who
act ually do t his kind of t hing for [ disfm arker] for [ disfm arker] for
[ disfm arker] m for v ideo or for audio [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] where
y ou [ disfm arker] you need t o do t his ,
fe008 [ s^ bk] : I see .
fe008 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e028 [ s] : and so y ou get very good at sort of jost ling back and fort h
, rat her t han hit t ing t ab , and backspace , and carriage ret urn , and
ent er , and t hings like t hat .
m e025 [ b] : Mm m .
m e025 [ b] : Mm m .
fe008 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e022 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : Yeah , we t alked about t hings like foot pedals and
ot her analog [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : So [ vocalsound] I m ean , t ho t hose are t hings we could do
m e011 [ fh] : but
m e011 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I just don’t know how m uch it ’s wort h
doing .
m e028 [ b] : Ye − Yeah .
m e011 [ s.%−] : I m ean we ’re just gonna have [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e028 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : I [ disfm arker] I agree .
m e022 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : They [ disfm arker] t hey have several opt ions .
fe008 [ s] : So , uh , you know , I m ent ioned t he looping opt ion .

fe008 [ s] : Anot her opt ion is it ’ll pause when it reaches t he end of t he
boundary .
fe008 [ s^ e] : And t hen t o get t o t he nex t boundary you just press t ab
fe008 [ s^ e] : and it goes on t o t he next unit .
m e011 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : I m ean , it ’s very nicely t hought out .
m e028 [ s^ ba] : Cool .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : They t hought about [ disfm arker]
m e022 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : and also it ’ll [ vocalsound] go around t he c t he , uh ,
fe008 [ s] : I wanna say cursor
fe008 [ s^ no] : but I ’m not sure if t hat ’s t he right t hing .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Point ,
m e011 [ s] : what ev er .
fe008 [ s] : Any way , you can [ disfm arker] so t hey t hought about
different way s of hav ing windows t hat you c uh work wit hin ,
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] But so in t erm s of t he con t he convent ions
, t hen , [ v ocalsound] uh , basically , [ v ocalsound] uh , it ’s st rict ly
ort hographic
fe008 [ s^ df] : which m eans wit h som e w provisions for , uh , w uh ,
[ v ocalsound] colloquial form s .
fe008 [ s^ e] : So if a person said , " cuz " inst ead of " because " t hen I
put a [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] an apost rophe at t he beginning of t he
word and t hen in [ disfm arker] in double ang angle bracket s what t he
full lex ical it em would be .
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : And t his could be [ vocalsound] som et hing t hat was handled
by a t able or som et hing
fe008 [ s] : but I t hink [ vocalsound] t o have a convent ion m arking it as
a non − st andard or wha I don’t m ean st andard [ disfm arker] but a
[ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a non [ vocalsound] uh , ort ho ort hographic
, uh , what ev er .
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e022 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Non − canonical .
fe008 [ s^ e] : " Gonna " or " wanna " ,
fe008 [ s] : y ou know , t he sam e t hing .
fe008 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and t here would be lim it s t o how m uch
refinem ent you want in indicat ing som et hing as non − st andard pres
pronunciat ion .
m e022 [ qw] : How are you handling backchannels ?
fe008 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Backchannels ?
fe008 [ fh] : Um ,
m e011 [ qy ^ d] : Com m ent s .
fe008 [ %−−] : y ou know [ disfm arker]

fe008 [ s^ bk] : oh , y es ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : t here was som e [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : in m y view , when i when you ’ve got it densely overlapping ,
um , I didn’t worry about [ disfm arker] I didn’t worry about s specific
st art t im es .
m e022 [ qw.%−] : What do you m ean by du
fe008 [ s] : I sort of t hought t hat t his is not gonna be [ com m ent ] easily
processed any way
fe008 [ s:s^ ar] : and [ vocalsound] m aybe I shouldn’t spend t oo m uch
t im e get t ing exact ly when t he person said [ vocalsound] " no " , or , you
know , uh , i " im m ediat e " .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : And inst ead just sort of rendered " wit hin t his t im e slot ,
[ v ocalsound] t here were t wo people speaking during part of it
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : and [ v ocalsound] if you want m ore det ail , figure it out for
y ourself " ,
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e022 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e011 [ s^ ng] : Well , I t hink what [ disfm arker] w what Eric was t alking
about was channels ot her t han t he direct speech ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : was sort of t he way I felt @ @ [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e022 [ s^ aa] : Well , yeah ,
m e022 [ s^ df.%−−] : what I m ean is wh I m ean , when som ebody says "
uh − huh " in t he m iddle of , uh , a @ @ [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
fe008 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe008 [ s] : That happened very seldom .
m e022 [ s^ df] : Oh , cuz I was [ disfm arker] I was list ening t o
[ disfm arker] Dan was agreeing a lot t o t hings t hat you were saying as

t he sam e t em t im e fram e
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , t here ’s an overlapping m ark .
m e022 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : but wouldn’t say ex act ly when it happened .
m e028 [ s] : I ’ll be right back .
m e025 [ s] : I t ranscribed a m inut e of t his st uff

m e022 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e025 [ s] : and t here was a lot of ov erlapping .
m e025 [ %−] : It was [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ na] : A lot of overlapping , yeah .
m e011 [ s^ na] : Well t here t here ’s a lot of overlapping at t he
beginning and end .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ e] : Huge am ount s .
m e025 [ s] : It was at t he beginning .
m e011 [ fh|s^ e] : Um , when [ disfm arker] when no one i when we ’re
not act ually in t he m eet ing , [ vocalsound] and we ’re all sort of
separat ed , and [ disfm arker] and doing t hings .
m e011 [ s] : But ev en during t he m eet ing t here ’s a lot of overlap
m e011 [ s] : but it [ disfm arker] it ’s m arked pret t y clearly .
m e011 [ s] : Um , som e of t he backchannel st uff Jane had som e
com m ent s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ df] : and [ disfm arker] but I t hink a lot of t hem were because
y ou were at t he m eet ing .
m e011 [ s] : And so I t hink t hat [ disfm arker] t hat oft en [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] oft en y ou can’t t ell .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
fe008 [ s^ na] : well t hat ’s t rue .
fe008 [ s] : That ’s anot her issue .
m e011 [ s^ e] : I m ean , Jane had [ disfm arker] had com m ent s like uh ,
t o [ disfm arker] who [ disfm arker] who t he person was speaking t o .
m e022 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ aap] : Only when it was ot herwise gonna be puzzling
fe008 [ s^ df] : because he was in t he ot her room t alking .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ ng] : Yeah , but som eone who , uh , [ vocalsound] was
just t he t ranscriber wouldn’t have known t hat .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : That ’s t rue .
m e022 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ df:s] : Or when Dan said , " I wa I wasn’t t alking t o you " .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : I know .
m e028 [ qy ^ d^ j.%−] : So you t ake a bat hroom break in t he m iddle and
[ disfm arker] and keep your head m ount
m e011 [ s] : You have t o t urn off y our m ike .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e028 [ qy ^ bh^ d] : Oh , you do ?
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well he was
m e025 [ s^ nd] : You don’t have t o .

fe008 [ s] : so [ disfm arker] so he was checking t he m et er levels
fe008 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and we were handling t hings while he was
labeling t he [ disfm arker] t he what ever it was ,
fe008 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : t he PDA ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Uh − huh .
fe008 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and so he was [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker]
sort of [ disfm arker] you were sort of t alking [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ fh] : y ou know ,
fe008 [ s:s^ cc] : so I was saying , like [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] " and I
could label t his one left .
fe008 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ? "
fe008 [ s:s] : And he [ disfm arker] and he said , " I don’t see anyt hing " .
fe008 [ s:s] : And he said [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] he said ,
[ v ocalsound] " I wasn’t t alking t o you " .
fe008 [ s^ df] : Or [ disfm arker] it wasn’t [ disfm arker] it didn’t sound
quit e t hat rude .
m e011 [ fg] : But [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−] : But really , no , uh [ disfm arker] w you know in t he
cont ext if y ou know he can’t hear what he ’s saying [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.%−] : but when you w when you list en t o it [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ %−] : he he
m e028 [ s] : It was a lot funnier if you were t here t hough .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Uh , y eah ,
fe008 [ s^ bk] : I know .
fe008 [ s] : Well , y ou ’ll see .
m e011 [ s] : Well what [ disfm arker] what it [ disfm arker] what happens
is if y ou ’re a t ranscriber list ening t o it it sounds like Dan is just being a
t ot al [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t ot ally im polit e .
fe008 [ s] : You can list en t o it .
fe008 [ s] : Oh , I t hought it was you who was .
fe008 [ fg|s^ df] : No , well , but you were [ disfm arker] you were asking
off t he wall quest ions .
m e011 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but if y ou knew t hat [ disfm arker] t hat I
wasn’t act ually in t he room , and t hat Dan wasn’t t alking t o m e , it
[ disfm arker] it becam e OK .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e028 [ %] : So t h
m e011 [ fh] : So .
fe008 [ s] : And t hat ’s w t hat ’s where I added com m ent s .
m e022 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s] : The rest of t he t im e I didn’t bot her wit h who was t alking t o
who

fe008 [ s^ df] : but [ disfm arker] but t his was unusual circum
circum st ance .
m e028 [ s^ bu^ j|qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : So t his is [ disfm arker] t his is gonna go
on t he m eet ing m eet ing t ranscriber bloopers t ape , right ?
m e011 [ s^ aa^ j] : Yes .
m e011 [ s^ aa^ j] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : Well and part of it was funny , uh [ disfm arker] reason was
because it was a m ix ed signal
fe008 [ s^ df] : so y ou couldn’t get any clues from volum e [ vocalsound]
t hat , you know , he was really far away from t his conversat ion .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : St ereo .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : You couldn’t do t hat sym m et rically in any case .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : No .
m e011 [ fg] : Oh .
m e011 [ s] : I should rewrit e t he m ix t ool t o put half t he people in one
channel and half in t he ot her .
m e011 [ s^ df] : I have a [ pause] aut o − gain − m ixer t ool t hat m ixes all
t he head m ount ed m icrophones int o one signal
fe008 [ s^ ba^ na] : That ’s a good idea .
m e028 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ df] : and t hat seem s t o work really well for t he uh [ pause]
t ranscribers .
m e028 [ s^ ba] : Great .
fe008 [ s] : But I t hought it would be [ disfm arker] you know , I
[ disfm arker] I didn’t wanna add m ore cont ext ual com m ent s t han were
needed
fe008 [ s^ df] : but t hat , it seem ed t o m e , clarified t hat t he con what
was going on .
fe008 [ fh] : And , uh [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
fe008 [ s] : so norm alizat ion [ disfm arker]
m e022 [ fg] : So , s
m e022 [ s] : I was just gonna ask , uh , so I just want ed t o c sort of
finish off t he quest ion I had about backchannels ,
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e022 [ s^ e] : if t hat ’s OK ,
m e025 [ b] : Mm m .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e022 [ s^ e] : which [ disfm arker] which was , so say som ebody ’s
t alking for a while
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e022 [ s:b] : and som ebody goes " m m − hm m " in t he m iddle of it ,
and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and what not ,

m e022 [ qy ^ rt ] : does t he conversat ion com e out from t he [ disfm arker]
or t he person who ’s speaking for t he long t im e as one segm ent and
t hen t here ’s t his lit t le t iny segm ent [ v ocalsound] of t his ot her speaker
m e022 [ qrr] : or does it [ disfm arker] does t he fact t hat t here ’s a
backchannel split t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] it
in t wo .
fe008 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , m y [ disfm arker] m y focus was t o t ry and m aint ain
cont en con cont ent cont inuit y and , uh , t o keep it wit hin what he was
say ing .
fe008 [ s^ e] : Like [ vocalsound] I wouldn’t say breat h groups but
prosodic or int onat ional groups as m uch as possible .
fe008 [ s^ df:b] : So [ vocalsound] if som eone said " m m − hm m " in t he
m iddle of a [ disfm arker] of som eone ’s , [ vocalsound] uh , uh ,
int onat ional cont our , [ vocalsound] I [ disfm arker] I indicat ed it as , like
what y ou just did .
m e022 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ df] : t hen I indicat ed it as a segm ent which cont ained
[ v ocalsound] @ @ [ com m ent ] t his ut t erance plus an overlap .
m e022 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e025 [ s] : But t hat ’s [ disfm arker] but t here ’s only one [ disfm arker]
t here ’s only one t im e boundary for bot h speakers ,
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
fe008 [ s^ aa] : t hat ’s right .
m e025 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe008 [ s] : And y ou know , it could be m ade m ore precise t han t hat
fe008 [ s.%−] : but I just t hought [ disfm arker]
m e022 [ s^ bk] : I see ,
m e022 [ s^ bk^ r] : I see ,
m e022 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e022 [ b] : Right .
m e028 [ s^ cs^ j] : I t hink whenev er we use t hese speech words we
should alway s [ v ocalsound] do t he t hing like you ’re t alking about ,
accent ,
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see what you m ean .
fe008 [ s^ j] : And t hen [ pause] " hesit at ion " .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ fg] : OK ,
fe008 [ s:fh] : and so t hen , uh , in t erm s of like words like " uh " and "
um " I just wrot e t hem
fe008 [ s^ df] : because I figured t here ’s a lim it ed num ber ,
fe008 [ s] : and I keep t hem t o a [ disfm arker] uh , lim it ed set
fe008 [ s^ df:fh] : because it didn’t m at t er if it was " m m m " or " um " ,
[ com m ent ] [ v ocalsound] you know , versus " um " .
fe008 [ s] : So I just always wrot e it as U M .

fe008 [ s:b] : And " uh − huh " , y ou know , " UHUH . " I m ean , like a s
set of like fiv e .
m e025 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : But in any case [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] I didn’t m ark
t hose .
m e022 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e025 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e025 [ s^ df^ nd] : " Uh − huh " is " U H H U H . "
m e025 [ s^ df^ nd] : H U H . "
fe008 [ s] : I ’d be happy wit h t hat .
fe008 [ s^ na] : That ’d be fine .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : It ’d be good t o have t hat in t he [ disfm arker] in t he
conv ent ions , what ’s t o be used .
m e022 [ s^ ar^ j] : Huh − uh .
m e011 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I did not ice t hat t here were som e segm ent s
t hat had pauses on t he beginning and end .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : We should probably m ark areas t hat have no speakers
as no speaker .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
fe008 [ s^ ba^ na] : t hat ’s a fine idea .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : Then , so quest ion m ark colon is fine for t hat .
fe008 [ s^ ba^ na] : That ’s a fine idea .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
fe008 [ s^ aa] : OK .
m e028 [ qw] : Well , what ’s t hat m ean ?
m e011 [ s^ e] : Just say silence .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e028 [ qy ^ d.%−] : You m ean re
m e011 [ s] : No one ’s t alking .
m e028 [ s^ bk] : y e s Oh .
m e028 [ s^ bu] : Silence all around .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e028 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
fe008 [ s.%−] : So I had [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : We have t o m ark t hose ?
fe008 [ %−] : I d
m e025 [ qy ^ rt ] : Don’t t hey [ disfm arker] d can’t we just leave t hem
unm arked ?
fe008 [ s^ na] : Well , you see , t hat ’s possible t oo .
m e011 [ h|s.%−−] : Well , I wanna leav e t he m arked [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ng] : I don’t want t hem t o be part of anot her ut t erance .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ df] : So you just [ disfm arker] you need t o have t he
boundary at t he st art and t he end .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Sure .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

fe008 [ s] : Now t hat ’s refinem ent t hat , uh , m aybe it could be handled
by part of t he [ disfm arker] part of t he script or som et hing m ore
[ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Uh , yeah ,
m e025 [ s.%−−] : it seem s like [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s] : it seem s like t he , uh , t ran t he t ranscript ion problem
would be very different if we had t hese [ v ocalsound] aut om at ic
speaker det ect ion t urn placing t hings .
m e025 [ s^ df.%−−] : Because suddenly [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ fh] : I m ean , I don’t know ,
m e025 [ s] : act ually it sounds like t here m ight be a problem
[ v ocalsound] put t ing it int o t he soft ware if t he soft ware only handles
t wo parallel channels .
m e025 [ s] : But assum ing we can get around t hat som ehow .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well y ou were say ing , I t hink it can read [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : It can read and writ e as m any as you want ,
m e011 [ s.%−] : it ’s just t hat it
fe008 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e025 [ qw^ rt ] : But what if you wanna edit it ?
m e025 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e025 [ s^ df] : I m ean , t he point is we ’re gonna generat e
[ v ocalsound] t his t ranscript wit h five [ disfm arker] five t racks in it , but
wit h no words .
m e025 [ s] : Som eone ’s gonna hav e t o go in and t ype in t he words .
m e025 [ fh] : Um ,
m e025 [ s.%−] : and if t here are five [ disfm arker] five people speaking
at once ,
m e011 [ s^ bk|%−−] : Right , i it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : I didn’t explain it well .
m e011 [ s] : If we use t he [ disfm arker] t he lit t le [ disfm arker] t he
conv ent ions t hat Jane has est ablished , I have a script t hat will conv ert
from t hat conv ent ion t o t heir saved convent ion .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Oh , yeah .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Yes .
fe008 [ s] : Which allows five .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ bu] : And it can be m edit ed aft er t he fact ,
fe008 [ qy ^ g] : can’t it also ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe008 [ s^ bu] : But t heir [ disfm arker] but t heir form at , if you want ed t o
in indicat e t he speakers right t here inst ead of doing it t hrough t his
indirect rout e , [ vocalsound] t hen i t hey [ disfm arker] a c window com es
up and it only allows you t o ent er t wo speakers .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Right .

m e028 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : But you ’re say ing t hat by t he t im e you call it
back in t o [ disfm arker] from t heir saved form at it opens up a window
wit h window wit h fiv e speakers ?
fe008 [ fh] : So .
fe008 [ fh] : But .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e028 [ s^ bk] : Oh !
m e028 [ s.%−−] : That is sort of [ pause] f
m e028 [ s.%−] : They didn’t quit e go t he whole [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : It ’s just user int erface .
m e011 [ %−] : So i it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , t hey didn’t go t he whole rout e ,
m e028 [ qy ^ g] : did t hey ?
m e011 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he whole saved form t he
sav ed form at and t he int ernal form at , all t hat st uff , handles m ult iple
speakers .
m e028 [ s.%−] : They just [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ df] : It ’s just t here ’s no user int erface for specifying
m ult iple [ disfm arker] any m ore t han t wo .
m e028 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e028 [ s^ bu] : So your [ disfm arker] your script solv es [ disfm arker]
Doesn’t it solv e all our problem s ,
fe008 [ s.%−] : And t hat [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e028 [ s^ df] : cuz we ’re always gonna wanna go t hrough t his
preprocessing [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e028 [ s^ e] : uh , assum ing it works .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
fe008 [ s] : And t hat works nicely cuz t his so quick t o ent er .
fe008 [ s] : So I wouldn’t wanna do it t hrough t he int erface anyway
adding which [ disfm arker] worry who t he speaker was .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m e028 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e028 [ b] : Right .
m e028 [ s^ ba] : Good .
fe008 [ s] : And t hen , uh , let ’s see what else .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh , yes ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] I want ed t o have [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So som et im es a pers I [ disfm arker] uh
fe008 [ s] : in t erm s of like t he cont inuit y of t hought [ vocalsound] for
t ranscript ions , it ’s [ disfm arker] i it isn’t just words com ing out ,
fe008 [ s] : it ’s like t here ’s som e purpose for an ut t erance .
fe008 [ s] : And [ v ocalsound] som et im es som eone will [ vocalsound] do
a backchannel in t he m iddle of it
fe008 [ s] : but y ou wanna show t hat it ’s cont inued at a lat er point .

fe008 [ s] : So I hav e [ disfm arker] I have a convent ion of put t ing like a
dash [ v ocalsound] arrow just t o indicat e t hat t his person ’s ut t erance
cont inues .
fe008 [ s] : And t hen when it uh , cat ches back up again t hen t here ’s
an arrow dash ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : and t hen you have t he opposit e direct ion [ vocalsound]
t o indicat e cont inuat ion of ones own ut t erance versus ,
fe008 [ fh] : um ,
fe008 [ s] : som et im es [ vocalsound] we had t he sit uat ion which is
[ disfm arker] you know , which you [ disfm arker] which you get in
conv ersat ions , [ com m ent ] of som eone cont inuing som eone else ’s
ut t erance ,
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Mm m .
fe008 [ s] : and in t hat case I did a t ilde arrow versus a arrow t ilde ,
[ v ocalsound] t o indicat e t hat it was cont inuat ion
fe008 [ s.%−−] : but it wasn’t [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh , I guess I did [ v ocalsound] equal arrow for t he
[ disfm arker] for t he own [ disfm arker] for y ourself t hings
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ df] : cuz it ’s [ disfm arker] t he speakers t he sam e .
fe008 [ s] : And t hen t ilde arrow if it was a different [ disfm arker] if a
different speaker , uh , con cont inuat ion .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Mm m .
m e011 [ b] : Oh .
fe008 [ s] : But just , you know , t he arrows showing cont inuat ion of a
t hought .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And t hen you could t rack whet her it was t he sam e
speaker or not by knowing [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : you know , at t he end of t his unit you ’d know what
happened lat er .
fe008 [ s^ df] : And t hat was like t his person cont inued
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ df] : and y ou ’d be able t o [ v ocalsound] look for t he
cont inuat ion .
m e025 [ s] : But t he only t im e t hat becom es am biguous is if you have
t wo speakers .
m e011 [ fg] : So
m e025 [ s^ df] : Like , if you [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] If you only have
one person , if you only have one t hought t hat ’s cont inuing across a
part icular t im e boundary , you just need [ vocalsound] one arrow at
each end ,
m e025 [ s^ df] : and if it ’s picked up by a different speaker , it ’s picked
up by a different speaker .
m e025 [ s^ df] : The t im e it becom es am biguous if you have m ore t han
one speaker and t hat [ disfm arker] and t hey sort of swap .

m e025 [ s] : I guess if you have m ore t han one t hread going , t hen you
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] t hen you need t o know whet her t hey were
swapped or not .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e022 [ qw] : How oft en does t hat happen do you t hink ?
m e025 [ s] : Hopefully not very m uch .
fe008 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , I didn’t use it v ery oft en .
m e011 [ s] : Especially for m eet ings .
m e028 [ %] : It l ou
m e011 [ s^ df] : I m ean , if i if you were just recording som eone ’s day ,
it would be im possible . You know ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : if you were t rying t o do a rem em brance agent .
m e011 [ s] : But I t hink for m eet ings it ’s probably alright .
m e022 [ b] : Hm m .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : But , a lot of t hese issues , I t hink t hat for [ disfm arker]
uh , from m y point of view , where I just wanna do speech recognit ion
and inform at ion ret rieval , it doesn’t really m at t er .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Sure .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : I know .
m e011 [ s] : But ot her people have ot her int erest s .
m e025 [ s] : But it [ disfm arker] it does feel [ disfm arker] it does feel like
it ’s really in t here .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e025 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] you know I did t his [ disfm arker] I did t his
t ranscript ion
m e025 [ s] : and I m arked t hat , I m arked it wit h ellipsis
m e025 [ s^ df] : because it seem ed like t here was a difference .
m e025 [ s^ df] : It ’s som et hing you want ed t o indicat e t hat it
[ disfm arker] t hat I [ disfm arker] t his was t he end of t he phrase ,
m e025 [ s^ df] : t his was t he end of [ v ocalsound] t hat part icular
t ranscript ,
m e025 [ s^ df] : but it was cont inued lat er .
m e025 [ s] : And I picked up wit h an ellipsis .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Excellent .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s] : I didn’t have t he equal , not equal t hing .
fe008 [ s^ na] : Well t hat ’s [ disfm arker] you know , I m ean [ disfm arker] I
[ disfm arker] t hat ’s why I didn’t [ com m ent ] I didn’t do it
fe008 [ s.%−−] : n [ vocalsound] I m ean , t hat ’s why I t hought about it ,
and [ disfm arker] and re − ev
m e025 [ b] : Yeah , y eah .

fe008 [ s] : and it didn’t do [ disfm arker] I didn’t do it in t en t im es t he
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] t he t im e .
fe008 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fg|qy ^ t c] : Well , so any way , are we int erest ed t hen in writ ing
t ools t o t ry t o generat e any of t his st uff aut om at ically ?
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t hat som et hing you want t o do , Dan ?
m e025 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e025 [ s] : But it ’s som et hing @ @ t hat I feel we definit ely ought t o
do .
m e011 [ s^ bk^ m ] : No .
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : I also want ed t o ask you if you have a t im e est im at e on
t he part t hat y ou t ranscribed .
fe008 [ qy .%−] : Do you have a sense of how long [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , it t ook m e half an hour t o t ranscribe a m inut e
,
m e025 [ s.%−−] : but I didn’t have any [ disfm arker] I didn’t even have a
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e025 [ s] : I was t rying t o get Transcriber t o run but I couldn’t .
m e025 [ s^ df] : So I was doing it by t yp t yping int o a t ext file and t rying
t o fit [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e025 [ s^ ba] : It was horrible .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e028 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So t hirt y t o one ’s what you got ?
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e028 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So t hat ’s a new upper lim it ?
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−] : Well , I m ean , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s because you
didn’t have t he segm ent at ion help and all t he ot her [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ qy .%−] : Is it [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : But I t hink for a first t ry t hat ’s about right .
m e022 [ s.%−] : So [ disfm arker] so if we hired a who if we hired a whole

m e028 [ s^ cc^ j] : I won’t com e t o y our next m eet ing .
m e028 [ fg] : And [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ s.%−] : and y ou So t his is t he box ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ co^ fe^ j] : Get your paper off m y PDA !
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ co^ j] : let [ disfm arker] let t he record show t hat t his is exhibit
t wo B .
m e028 [ s^ bk] : That ’s right .
m e028 [ s^ j] : " Or not t o be " .
m e028 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e028 [ fg|s] : Uh , t he box , uh [ disfm arker] t here ’s a half inch lip
here .
m e028 [ s] : The box is an inch t hick
m e028 [ s] : so it hangs down a half an inch .

m e028 [ s] : And so t he [ disfm arker] t he t wo [ vocalsound] head set
jacks would be in t he front
m e028 [ s] : and t hen t he lit t le LED t o indicat e t hat t hat box is live .
m e028 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he im port ant issue about t he LED is t he
fact t hat we ’re t alking about eight of t hese t ot al , which would be
six t een channels .
m e028 [ fh|s] : And , uh , even t hough we have sixt een channels back
at t he capt ure , t hey ’re not all gonna be used for t his .
m e025 [ b] : Hm m .
m e028 [ s^ df] : So t here ’d be a subset of t hem used for [ disfm arker]
obviously j just use t he ones at t his end for [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
for t his m any .
m e028 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ s^ fa] : Ex cuse m e .
m e028 [ s] : y ou ’d like a [ disfm arker] a way t o t ell whet her your box is
liv e , so t he LED wouldn’t be on .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e025 [ s] : All t he light s .
m e028 [ s^ e] : So if you ’re plugged in it doesn’t work and t he LED is off
t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a t ip off .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s good .
m e028 [ s] : And t hen t he , uh [ disfm arker] would wire t he [ disfm arker]
all of t he cables in a [ disfm arker] in a bundle com e t hrough here and o
obviously collect t hese cables at t he sam e t im e .
m e028 [ fh|s] : Uh , so t his [ disfm arker] t his not ion of put t ing down t he
P Z Ms [ vocalsound] and t aking t hem away would som ehow have t o be
t urned int o leav ing t hem on t he t able
m e028 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ na] : Well , we wanna do t hat definit ely .
m e028 [ b] : Right .
m e028 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e028 [ s] : And so t he [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker] we just epox y
t hem down or som et hing .
m e028 [ s^ e^ j] : Big screw int o t he t able .
m e025 [ s^ cs] : Velcro .
m e028 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e028 [ s] : and even t hough t here ’s eight cables t hey ’re not really
v ery big around
m e028 [ s.%−−] : so m y m odel is t o get a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a p
piece of [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Sleeve .
m e028 [ s^ bk|s] : yeah , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat st uff t hat people put
wit h t he lit t le [ disfm arker] you slip t he wires int o t hat ’s [ vocalsound]
sort of shaped like t hat cross sect ion .

m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e028 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e011 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : OK , not just sleeve t hem all ?
m e028 [ s] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m r a I ’m going up and t hen I ’m going
down .
m e025 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e011 [ qy^ d] : And leave t hem loose ?
fe008 [ s] : That looks like a sem i − circle .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s] : It ’s like a [ disfm arker] it ’s a sleeping policem an .
fe008 [ s^ bk^ m .%−] : Sleeping pol

m e025 [ s^ j] : Speed bum p .
m e011 [ s^ bk.%−] : Speed
m e028 [ s^ aa|s^ na.%−] : Yeah , it ’s like a speed bum [ vocalsound] An
fe008 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Speed bum p .
m e011 [ s] : A " sleeping policem an " !
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s good .
fe008 [ s] : There we go
fe008 [ %] : s
m e028 [ s] : And t hey ’re ac t hey ’re act ually ext ext ruded from plast ic .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Cool .
m e022 [ qw.%−] : What is [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ s] : They sort a look like t his .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e022 [ qw^ rt ] : What does t hat m ean ?
m e025 [ s] : That ’s t he s t hat ’s Brit ish for speed bum p ,
m e022 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is it a speed bum p ?
m e028 [ s] : So t hat t he wires go t hrough here .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
fe008 [ qy ^ bh^ rt ] : Oh , is t hat right ?
m e022 [ s^ ba^ fe] : Wow .
fe008 [ s] : I never heard t hat .

m e011 [ s^ ba] : That ’s really cruel .
m e011 [ fg] : OK ,
m e028 [ %] : s
m e011 [ s.%−] : so t hat [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ s] : So it would c basically go on t he diagonal here .
m e022 [ s] : It could go eit her way .
m e011 [ qw^ rt ] : So why do we have sixt een channels inst ead of like
som e fewer num ber ?
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .

m e022 [ s] : I guess .
m e028 [ h|s.%−] : Uh , because t he [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ qh] : How else are you gonna dist ribut e t hem around t he

m e028 [ s] : Because t hey ’re t here .
m e011 [ h|s^ bk] : Well , OK ,
m e011 [ s^ co] : let m e rephrase t hat .
m e011 [ qw] : Why t wo each ?
m e025 [ s] : Oh , because t hen you don’t have t o just have one each .
m e025 [ s^ df] : So t hat if t if you hav e t wo people sit t ing next t o each
ot her t hey can act ually go int o t he sam e box .
m e028 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e028 [ s] : And t o [ disfm arker] See , t hi t his is really t he way people

m e028 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ b] : OK .
m e028 [ s^ cs] : And cert ainly you could do a t hing where all sixt een
were plugged in .
m e028 [ s^ e] : Uh if [ disfm arker] if you ha if you had not hing else .
m e011 [ s] : But t hen none of t hese .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : N none of t hese and no P Z Ms t hen .
m e028 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e028 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e028 [ s^ aa^ r] : Right .
m e028 [ s^ aa] : I agree .
m e025 [ s.%−−] : Only if you had [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s|qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Well it depends on t his box , right ?
m e028 [ s^ na] : Oh , t rue enough .
m e028 [ s] : And act ually , at t he m m y plan is t o only bring eight wires
out of t his box .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Exact ly .

m e028 [ s.%−] : This [ disfm arker] t his box [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh , I didn’t underst and [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : That being t he wiring box .
m e028 [ s] : Thi − t hi t hi t his box is a one off deal .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see ,
m e011 [ s^ bk^ r] : I see .
m e028 [ fh] : Uh .
m e028 [ fh|s^ df] : And , uh , it ’s funct ion is t o s t o , uh , essent ially a
wire convert er t o go from t hese lit t le blue wires t o t hese black wires ,
m e028 [ s^ e] : plus supply power t o t he m icrophones
m e028 [ s^ df] : cuz t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] he t he , uh ,
cheap head m ount eds all require low v olt age .
m e011 [ fg|qy ^ d] : So [ disfm arker] so you ’d im agine som e sort of
[ disfm arker] in som e sort of pat ch panel on t op t o figure out what t he
m apping was bet ween each d of t hese t wo and each of t hose one or
what ?
m e028 [ %−−] : Well I w I I
m e025 [ b] : Hm m !
m e028 [ s] : t he sim plest t hing I could im agine , i which is really , really
sim ple is t o [ disfm arker] quit e lit erally t hat t hese t hings plug in .
m e028 [ s] : And t here ’s a [ disfm arker] t here ’s a plug on t he end of
each of t hese [ disfm arker] t hese , uh , ei eight cables .
fe008 [ %−] : What [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ 2] : Each of t he blue wires ?
m e025 [ s] : But t here are only four .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e028 [ s^ na] : An − and t here ’s only [ disfm arker] t here ’s only four
slot s t hat are [ disfm arker] you know , in [ disfm arker] in t he first version
or t he v ersion we ’re planning t o [ disfm arker] t o build .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e028 [ s] : So [ vocalsound] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat was t he whole issue
wit h t he LED ,
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e028 [ s^ df] : t hat you plug it in , t he LED com es on , and
[ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and y ou ’re live .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh , t hen it com es on .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : I see , I see .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e011 [ s^ ba] : good .
m e028 [ s] : Now t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t he
subt le issue here is t hat [ disfm arker] t ha I [ disfm arker] I haven’t really
figured out a solut ion for t his .
m e028 [ s] : So , we it ’ll have t o be convent ion .

m e028 [ qw] : What happens if som ebody unplugs t his because t hey
plug in m ore of som et hing else ?
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e028 [ fh|s] : Well t he [ disfm arker] t here ’s no clever way t o let t he up
st ream guy s know t hat you ’re really not being powered .
m e028 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ s] : t h t here will be a cert ain am ount of looking at cables has
t o be done if people , uh , rewire t hings .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e028 [ fh] : But .
m e025 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , I m ean , we [ disfm arker] I had t hat last t im e .
m e025 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : But uh t here are act ually [ disfm arker] t hat you
know , t here ’s an ext ra [ disfm arker] t here ’s a m ix out on t he radio
receiv er ?
m e028 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e025 [ s] : So t here are act ually six [ vocalsound] XLR out s on t he
back of t he radio receiver
m e025 [ s] : and only five cables going in ,
m e025 [ s] : I had t he wrong five ,
m e025 [ s] : so I ended up [ vocalsound] not recording one of t he
channels and recording t he m ix .
m e028 [ s^ ba] : How int erest ing .
m e028 [ qy ^ rt ] : D did you do any recognit ion on t he m ix [ disfm arker]
m ix out ?
fe008 [ b] : Hm m .
m e025 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e028 [ s.%−] : Wonder whet her it works any [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s] : But I subt ract ed t he four t hat I did have from t he m ix and
got a pret t y good approxim at ion of t he @ @ .
m e028 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Got t he fift h ?
m e011 [ %−] : You g
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Oh , how great .
m e028 [ s^ ba^ fe] : Cool .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : And did it work ?
m e028 [ %−] : Is it [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Did it sound good ?
m e025 [ s^ na] : It ’s not bad .
m e025 [ s^ na^ r] : It ’s not bad ,
m e025 [ s^ bk] : yeah .
m e028 [ qh^ ba^ rt ] : Ain’t science wonderful ?
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Wow .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s am azing .
m e025 [ b] : Yeah .
m e028 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qw^ rt ] : So what ’s t he schedule on t hese t hings ?

fe008 [ s^ ba] : Wow .
m e025 [ s.%−] : But , you always [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ h] : Uh ,
m e028 [ s] : well I was wrest ling wit h t h wit h lit erally t he w num ber of
connect ors in t he cable and t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t he , uh ,
[ v ocalsound] powering syst em .
m e028 [ s] : And I [ disfm arker] I was gonna do t his very clever phant om
power
m e028 [ s] : and I decided a couple days ago not t o do it .
m e025 [ b] : Hm m !
m e028 [ s] : So I ’m ready t o build it .
m e028 [ s^ df] : Which is t o say , uh , t he neighborhood of a week t o
get t he circuit board done .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : So I t hink t he ot her t hing I ’d like t o do is , do
som et hing about t he set up
m e025 [ %−] : See
m e011 [ s^ df] : so t hat it ’s a lit t le m ore present able and organized .
m e028 [ s^ aa] : I agree .
m e011 [ s^ no] : And I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m just not sure what t hat is .
m e011 [ s^ e] : I m ean , som e sort of cabinet .
m e028 [ s] : Well I can build a cabinet .
m e028 [ s^ df] : The [ disfm arker] t he difficult y for t his kind of project is
t he int ellect ual capit al t o design t he cabinet .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e028 [ s^ df] : In ot her words , t o figure out ex exact ly what t he right
t hing is .
m e028 [ s] : That cabinet can [ disfm arker] can go away .
m e028 [ s^ cs^ j] : We can use t hat for [ disfm arker] for uh kindling or
som et hing .
m e028 [ s.%−−] : But if you can im agine what t he right form fact or is .
m e028 [ s] : Dan − Dan and I have sort of gone around on t his , and we
were t hinking about som et hing t hat opened up in t he t op [ vocalsound]
t o allow access t o t he m ixer for exam ple .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e028 [ s] : But t here ’s t hese t hings st icking out of t he m ixer which
are kind of a pain ,
m e028 [ s.%−−] : so you end up wit h t his t hing t hat [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ s^ e] : if if you st uck t he m ixer up here and t he t op opened , it
’d be [ disfm arker] it ’d be fine .
m e028 [ s.%−−] : You wouldn’t necessarily [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ fh] : Well ,
m e028 [ qy^ d.%−−] : you s underst and what I ’m [ disfm arker]

m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , I underst and .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e028 [ s^ cc] : and I can cert ainly build it out of oak
m e028 [ s^ df] : no problem ,

m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e025 [ s.%−−] : I t hink what [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s] : I t hink you [ disfm arker] I t hink it just plug plugs in a PC

m e025 [ s] : so you could probably m ake it run wit h t hat ,
m e025 [ fh] : but .
m e011 [ s] : The quest ion is , is t here an Apple driver ?

m e011 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m e028 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ ng] : But t hat does m ean [ disfm arker] so we can use t hat

m e028 [ fg|s^ cs] : Well , uh , t he [ disfm arker] cert ainly , u you should
giv e it a shot first See whet her you you can get com pat ible st uff .
m e025 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e028 [ s^ cs] : Uh , ask t hem what it cost s .

m e025 [ s^ bs] : However , seven and a half t housand of t hat was t he
wireless m ikes .
m e028 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e025 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e025 [ s.%−] : using [ disfm arker] using t hese [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ s^ j] : And it [ disfm arker] and t he f t he five t housand for t he
wires ,
m e028 [ s.%−−] : so if I ’m gonna do [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ %] : No .
m e028 [ s^ df] : It ’s a joke .
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e028 [ s.%−] : I hav e t o do [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s^ aa] : t hat ’s t rue
m e025 [ s|qy ^ d^ g] : but we hav en’t spent t hat , right ?
m e025 [ s|qy ^ d^ g] : But once we [ disfm arker] once we ’ve done t he
int ellect ual part of t hese , uh , we can just knock t hem out , right ?
m e011 [ s] : Cheap .
m e025 [ s^ cs] : We can st art [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] we [ disfm arker]
y ou can m ake a hundred of t hem or som et hing .

m e028 [ s^ bk|qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Oh , of t he [ disfm arker] of t he boards ?
m e028 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah ,
m e028 [ s^ aa] : sure ,
m e028 [ s^ aa] : right .
m e025 [ s^ cs.%−−] : And t hen we could [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s] : Washingt on could hav e a syst em t hat didn’t have any
wireless but would had [ disfm arker] what ’s based on t hese
m e028 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e025 [ s.%−−] : and it would cost [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ s^ 2] : Peanut s .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : A PC and a peanut s .
m e025 [ s^ e] : PC and t wo t housand dollars for t he A − t o − D st uff .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e025 [ s^ df.%−−] : And t hat ’s about [ disfm arker] cuz you wouldn’t
ev en need t he m ix er if you didn’t hav e t he [ disfm arker]
m e028 [ b] : Right .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Oh t h [ vocalsound] t he P Z
m e025 [ s] : P Z Ms cost a lot .
m e025 [ s] : But any way you ’d save , on t he seven [ disfm arker] seven
or eight t housand for t he [ disfm arker] for t he wireless syst em .
m e025 [ s] : So act ually t hat m ight be at t ract ive .
m e028 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Good .
m e025 [ s] : I can m ov e m y t hum b now .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s a great idea .
m e028 [ qw] : What ?
fe008 [ s^ ba] : It ’s nice [ disfm arker] it ’s nice t o be t hinking t oward
t hat .
m e028 [ s] : Oh , I t hought like if we t alked soft er t he disk last s longer .
m e011 [ s^ nd.%−−] : Well , act ually short en [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : There ’s a speech com pression program t hat works great
on t hings like t his ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : cuz if t he dynam ic range is low it encodes it wit h fewer
bit s .
m e011 [ s^ e] : And so m ost of t he t im e no one ’s t alking
m e011 [ s^ e] : so it short ens it dram at ically .
m e011 [ s^ e] : But [ vocalsound] if you t alk quiet er , t he dynam ic range
is lower and it will com press bet t er .
m e025 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Hm m .
m e028 [ s^ j] : It also helps if you t alk in a m onot one .
m e011 [ s^ am ] : Probably .

m e028 [ s^ e^ j] : Const ant volum e all t he t im e .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Oh , int erest ing .
fe008 [ s] : And short er words .
m e011 [ s^ m ^ na] : Short er words .
m e022 [ s^ bu] : Now , short er words wouldn’t [ disfm arker] would
induce m ore dynam ics ,
m e022 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e022 [ s.%−] : You want t o have [ disfm arker]
m e025 [ s^ aa|s^ df] : Yeah , but if t he words are m ore predict able .
m e011 [ qw:fh] : How about if you just go " uh " ?
m e022 [ b] : Huh .
m e028 [ s^ m ] : Uh .
fe008 [ s] : That ’s a long word !
m e011 [ qw] : How do you spell t hat ?

m e028 [ b] : Sure .
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Do we have m ore t o t alk about ?

m e028 [ fg|s] : But [ disfm arker] y ou [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker] you
[ disfm arker] t here ’s a problem [ disfm arker] a st ruct ural problem wit h
t his t hough .
m e028 [ s^ cs] : You really need an incent ive at t he end if you ’re gonna

m e028 [ s^ cs^ e^ j] : Like , you know , candy bars or som et hing ,
