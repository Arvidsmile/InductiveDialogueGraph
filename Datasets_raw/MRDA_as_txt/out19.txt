m e013 [ z] : OK . Doesn’t look like it crashed .
m e013 [ z] : That ’s great .
m e011 [ z] : So I t hink m aybe what ’s causing it t o crash is I keep
st art ing it and t hen st opping it t o see if it ’s working .
m e011 [ z] : And so I t hink st art ing it and t hen st opping it and st art ing
it again causes it t o crash .
m e011 [ z] : So , I won’t do t hat any m ore .
fe008 [ z] : And it looks like you ’ve found a way of uh m apping t he
locat ion t o t he [ disfm arker] wit hout hav ing people have t o give t heir
nam es each t im e ?
m e018 [ z] : Sounds like an init ializat ion t hing .
fe008 [ z] : I m ean it ’s like you have t he [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ z] : No .
fe008 [ z] : So y ou know t hat [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ z] : I m ean , are you going t o writ e down [ pause] t hat I sat here
?
m e011 [ z] : I ’m gonna collect t he digit form s and writ e it down .
fe008 [ z] : OK .
fe016 [ z] : Oh , OK .
m e011 [ z] : So [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ z] : So t hey should be right
m e011 [ z] : wit h what ’s on t he digit form s .
m e011 [ z] : OK , so I ’ll go ahead and st art wit h digit s .
m e011 [ z] : u
m e011 [ z] : And I should say t hat uh , you just pau you just read each
line an and t hen pause briefly .
m e013 [ z] : And st art by giving t he t ranscript num ber .
m n005 [ z] : Transcript [ disfm arker] Uh . OK , OK .
m e018 [ z] : Tran
m e018 [ z] : Oh sorry , go ahead .
m e013 [ s^ j] : So uh , you see , Don , t he unbridled excit em ent of t he
work t hat we have on t his project .
m e001 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : It ’s just uh [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ b] : Um h .
m e013 [ h|s^ na] : Uh , you know , it doesn’t seem like a bad idea t o
have [ com m ent ] t hat inform at ion .
m e011 [ s] : And I ’m surprised I sort of [ disfm arker] I ’m surprised I
forgot t hat ,
m e011 [ fh|s] : but uh I t hink t hat would be a good t hing t o add .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s.%−] : Yeah , I [ disfm arker] I ’d [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s
som e
m e011 [ s^ e] : Aft er I just print ed out a zillion of t hem .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Yeah , well , t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ t ] : Um , so I [ disfm arker] I do have a [ disfm arker] a an
agenda suggest ion .

m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , we [ disfm arker] I t hink t he t hings t hat we t alk about
in t his m eet ing uh t end t o be a m ixt ure of uh procedural uh m undane
t hings and uh research point s
m e013 [ fh|s] : and um I was t hinking I t hink it was a m eet ing a couple
of weeks ago t hat we [ disfm arker] we spent m uch of t he t im e t alking
about t he m undane st uff cuz t hat ’s easier t o get out of t he way
m e013 [ s] : and t hen we sort of drift ed int o t he research and m aybe
five m inut es int o t hat Andreas had t o leave .
m e013 [ fh|s^ cs] : So [ vocalsound] uh I ’m suggest ing we t urn it
around
m e013 [ s^ co] : and [ disfm arker] and uh sort of we have [ disfm arker]
anybody has som e m undane point s t hat we could send an em ail lat er ,
uh hold t hem for a bit , and let ’s t alk about t he [ disfm arker] t he
research − y kind of t hings .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , so um t he one t h one t hing I know t hat we have on
t hat is uh we had t alked a [ disfm arker] a couple weeks before um uh
about t he uh [ disfm arker] t he st uff you were doing wit h [ disfm arker]
wit h uh um uh l l at t em pt ing t o locat e event s ,
m e013 [ s:s] : we had a lit t le go around t ry ing t o figure out what you
m eant by " event s "
m e013 [ s:s] : but I t hink , you know , what we had m eant by " ev ent s " I
guess was uh point s of overlap bet ween speakers .
m e013 [ s] : But I t h I gat her from our discussion a lit t le earlier t oday
t hat y ou also m ean uh int errupt ions wit h som et hing else
m e013 [ s^ e] : like som e ot her noise .
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Yes ?
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Uh − huh . Yeah .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : You m ean t hat as an event also .
m e013 [ s] : So at any rat e you were [ disfm arker] you ’ve [ disfm arker]
y ou ’v e done som e work on t hat
m n005 [ %−−] : To
m n005 [ s^ aa] : right .
m e013 [ fh|s^ cs^ t ] : and um t hen t he ot her t hing would be it m ight be
nice t o hav e a prelim inary discussion of som e of t he ot her uh research
uh areas t hat uh we ’re t hinking about doing .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , I t hink especially since you [ disfm arker] you hav en’t
been in [ disfm arker] in t hese m eet ings for a lit t le bit ,
m e013 [ s^ t ] : m ay be you have som e discussion of som e of t he p t he
plausible t hings t o look at now t hat we ’re st art ing t o get dat a ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh and one of t he t hings I know t hat also cam e up uh is
som e discussions t hat [ disfm arker] t hat uh [ disfm arker] t hat uh Jane
had wit h Lokendra
m e013 [ s^ e.%−−] : uh about som e [ disfm arker] som e [ disfm arker]
som e um uh work about

m e013 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I d I [ disfm arker] I don’t want t o
t ry t o say cuz I [ disfm arker] I ’ll say it wrong ,
m e013 [ s] : but any way som e [ disfm arker] som e pot ent ial
collaborat ion t here about [ disfm arker] about t he [ disfm arker] about
t he [ disfm arker] working wit h t hese dat a .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m e013 [ fh] : So , uh .
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : You wanna just go around ?
m e013 [ h|s^ nd] : Uh . [ pause] Well , I don’t know if we [ disfm arker] if
t his is sort of like ev erybody has som et hing t o cont ribut e sort of t hing ,
m e013 [ s^ df^ e] : I t hink t here ’s just just a couple [ disfm arker] a
couple people prim arily
m e013 [ fh] : um but um
m e013 [ fh|qh^ cs.%−−] : Uh , wh why don’t [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Act ually I t hink t hat [ disfm arker] t hat last one I just said we
could do fairly quickly
m e013 [ qh^ cs] : so why don’t y ou [ disfm arker] you st art wit h t hat .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ qy^ rt ^ t ] : Shall I [ disfm arker] shall I just st art ?
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ co] : Yeah , just ex plain what it was .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ fh|s] : Um , so , uh , he was int erest ed in t he quest ion of
[ disfm arker] you know , relat ing t o his [ disfm arker] t o t he research he
present ed recent ly , um of inference st ruct ures ,
fe008 [ fh|s^ e] : and uh , t he need t o build in , um , t his [ disfm arker]
t his sort of uh m echanism for underst anding of language .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And he gave t he exam ple in his t alk about how [ pause]
um ,
fe008 [ s] : e a I ’m rem em bering it just off t he t op of m y head right now
,
fe008 [ s] : but it ’s som et hing about how um , i " Joe slipped " you know
, " John had washed t he floor " or som et hing like t hat .
fe008 [ s^ bd] : And I don’t have it quit e right ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : but t hat kind of t hing ,
fe008 [ s^ rt :s] : where you hav e t o draw t he inference t hat , OK , t here
’s t his t im e sequence ,
fe008 [ s] : but also t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he causal
aspect s of t he uh floor and [ disfm arker] and how it m ight have been
t he cause of t he fall
fe008 [ s] : and t hat um it was t he ot her person who fell t han t he one
who cleaned it
fe008 [ s^ e] : and it [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] These sort s of t hings .

fe008 [ fh|s] : So , I looked t hrough t he t ranscript t hat we have so far ,
[ com m ent ] and um , fou ident ified a couple different t ypes of t hings of
t hat t y pe
fe008 [ fh|s] : and um , one of t hem was som et hing like uh , during t he
course of t he t ranscript , um um , w we had gone t hrough t he part
where ev ery one said which channel t hey were on and which device
t hey were on ,
fe008 [ fh|s:qy ] : and um , t he quest ion was raised " Well , should we
rest art t he recording at t his point ? "
fe008 [ fh|s:s] : And [ disfm arker] and Dan Ellis said , " Well , we ’re just
so far ahead of t he gam e right now [ pause] we really don’t need t o " .
fe008 [ qh] : Now , how would y ou int erpret t hat wit hout a lot of
inference ?
fe008 [ fh|s:s] : So , t he inferences t hat are involved are t hings like , OK
, so , how do y ou int erpret " ahead of t he gam e " ?
fe008 [ fh|s^ co^ rt ] : You know . So it ’s t he [ disfm arker] it ’s [ pause] i
What y ou [ disfm arker] what you int what you draw [ disfm arker] you
know , t he conclusions t hat you need t o draw are t hat space is
inv olv ed in recording ,
m e011 [ fg|s] : Hm m , m et aphorically .
fe008 [ s^ e] : t hat um , i t hat [ pause] i we have enough space ,
fe008 [ s:s] : and he cont inues , like " we ’re so ahead of t he gam e cuz
now we hav e built − in downsam pling " .
fe008 [ s^ co:s] : So you have t o sort of get t he idea t hat um , " ahead
of t he gam e " is sp speaking wit h respect t o space lim it at ions ,
fe008 [ s] : t hat um t hat in fact downsam pling is gaining us enough
space ,
fe008 [ s] : and t hat t herefore we can keep t he recording we ’ve done
so far .
fe008 [ s] : But t here are a lot of different t hings like t hat .
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : So , do you t hink his int erest is in using t his as
[ pause] a dat a source ,
m e011 [ qrr^ rt ] : or [ pause] t raining m at erial ,
m e011 [ qrr] : or what ?
m e013 [ fg|s^ df] : Well , I [ disfm arker] I should m aybe int erject t o say
t his st art ed off wit h a discussion t hat I had wit h him ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : so um we were t rying t o t hink of ways t hat his int erest s
could int eract wit h ours
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s^ cs.x ] : and um uh I t hought t hat if we were going t o
project int o t he fut ure when we had a lot of dat a , uh and um such
t hings m ight be useful for t hat in or before we invest ed t oo m uch uh
effort int o t hat he should uh , wit h Jane ’s help , look int o som e of t he
dat a t hat we ’re [ disfm arker] already have
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ e:qy] : and see , is t here anyt hing t o t his at all ?

m e013 [ s:qy ] : Is t here any point which you t hink t hat , you know , you
could gain som e adv ant age and som e pot ent ial use for it .
m e013 [ s^ df.%−−:s] : Cuz it could be t hat you ’d look t hrough it and you
say " well , t his is just t he wrong [ pause] t ask for [ disfm arker] for him
t o pursue his [ disfm arker] "
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Wrong ,
m e011 [ b] : yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : And [ disfm arker] and uh I got t he im pression from your
m ail t hat in fact t here was enough t hings like t his just in t he lit t le
sam ple t hat [ disfm arker] t hat you looked at t hat [ disfm arker] t hat it ’s
plausible at least .
fe008 [ s^ am ] : It ’s possible .
fe008 [ s^ df] : Uh , he was [ disfm arker] he [ disfm arker] he [ disfm arker]
y ou know [ disfm arker] We m et and he was gonna go and uh you know ,
y look t hrough t hem m ore syst em at ically
m e013 [ b.%] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ e] : and t hen uh m eet again .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−] : So it ’s , you know , not a m at t er of a [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe008 [ fh|s] : But , yeah , I t hink [ disfm arker] I t hink it was opt im ist ic .
m e013 [ fg|s] : So anyway , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s e a quit e
different t hing from anyt hing we ’ve t alked about t hat , you know ,
m ight [ disfm arker] m ight [ disfm arker] m ight com e out from som e of
t his .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : But he can use t ext , basically .
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , he ’s t alking about just using t ext
fe008 [ s.%−] : That ’s his m ajor [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I m ent ioned several t hat w had t o do wit h im plicat ions
drawn from int onat ional cont ours
fe016 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : pret t y m uch ,
fe016 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
fe008 [ s] : and [ pause] t hat wasn’t as direct ly relevant t o what he ’s
doing .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ e] : He ’s int erest ed in t hese [ disfm arker] t hese knowledge
st ruct ures ,
m n005 [ s^ ba] : Yeah , int erest ing .
fe008 [ s^ e] : inferences t hat you draw [ pause] i from [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s^ cs.x] : I m ean , he cert ainly could use t ext ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : but we were in fact looking t o see if t here [ disfm arker]
is t here [ disfm arker] is t here som et hing in com m on bet ween our
int erest in m eet ings and his int erest in [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in
t his st uff .
m e013 [ fh] : So .

m e011 [ s] : And I im agine t hat t ranscript s of speech [ disfm arker] I
m ean t ex t t hat is speech [ disfm arker] probably has m ore of t hose t han
sort of prepared writ ing .
m e011 [ s^ no.x ] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know whet her it would or not ,
but it seem s like it would .
m e013 [ s^ no] : I don’t know ,
m e013 [ s] : probably de probably depends on what t he prepared
writ ing was .
m e013 [ fh] : But .
fe008 [ s^ bk|s^ nd] : Yeah , I don’t t hink I would m ake t hat leap ,
fe008 [ s^ df] : because i in narrat ives , you know [ disfm arker] I m ean ,
if y ou spell out ev ery t hing in a narrat ive , it can be really t edious ,
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ fh] : so .
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , I ’m just t hinking , you know , when you ’re
[ disfm arker] when you ’re face t o face , you have a lot of backchannel
m e011 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker] And [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ fe] : Oh .
fe008 [ s^ bu] : That aspect .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : And so I t hink it ’s just easier t o do t hat sort of broad
inference jum ping if it ’s face t o face .
m e011 [ s^ rt :s] : I m ean , so , if I just read t hat Dan was saying " we ’re
ahead of t he gam e " [ com m ent ] in t hat [ disfm arker] in t hat cont ext ,
fe008 [ %] : Well [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s.x ] : I m ight not realize t hat he was t alking about disk space
as opposed t o any t hing else .
fe008 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] you know , I [ disfm arker] I had several t hat
had t o do wit h backchannels and t his wasn’t one of t hem .
m e011 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : This [ disfm arker] t his one really does um m m ake you
leap from [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s:s] : So he said , you know , " we ’re ahead of t he gam e , w we
have built − in downsam pling " .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−] : And t he inference , i if you had it writ t en down , would be
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ 2] : I guess it would be t he sam e .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Uh − huh .
fe008 [ s^ arp] : But t here are ot hers t hat have backchannelling ,
fe008 [ s] : it ’s just he was less int erest ed in t hose .
m n017 [ qy .%−] : Can I [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ fa] : Sorry t o int errupt .

m n017 [ fh|s.x ] : Um , I f f f I ’ve [ disfm arker] @ @ [ com m ent ] d A m inut e
[ disfm arker] uh , sev eral m inut es ago , I , like , briefly was [ disfm arker]
was not list ening
m n017 [ qw^ rt .x :s] : and [ disfm arker] So who is " he " in t his cont ext ?
fe016 [ fg|s^ j.%−] : Yeah , t here ’s a lot of pronoun [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fg] : OK .
m n017 [ s:s] : So I was just realizing we ’ve [ disfm arker] You guys have
been t alking about " he " um for at least uh , I don’t know , t hree
[ disfm arker] t hree four m inut es wit hout ev er m ent ioning t he person ’s
nam e again .
fe016 [ %] : I believe it .
fe016 [ fg|s:s] : Yeah . Act ually t o m ake it worse , [ com m ent ] uh ,
Morgan uses " y ou " and " you "
m n017 [ s^ ba] : So t his is [ disfm arker] t his is [ disfm arker] t his is
[ disfm arker] gonna be a big , big problem if you want t o lat er do uh ,
y ou know , index ing , or speech underst anding of any sort .
m e011 [ s^ ng^ rt ] : It ’s in m y not es .
fe016 [ s^ e] : wit h gaze and no ident ificat ion ,
fe016 [ %−−] : or [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.x ] : I just wrot e t his down .
m n017 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt .x] : You just wrot e t his ?
fe016 [ s^ aa|s^ df.x:s] : Yeah , act ually . Cuz Morgan will say well , " you
had som e ideas "
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−] : and he never said Li − He looked [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ df] : Well , I t hink he ’s doing t hat int ent ionally ,
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right ,
m e011 [ qy^ g^ rt ] : aren’t you ?
fe016 [ s^ ba^ rt ] : so it ’s great .
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : So t his is really great
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ df] : because t he t hing is , because he ’s looking at t he per
ev en for addressees in t he conversat ion ,
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : I bet y ou could pick t hat up in t he acoust ics .
fe016 [ s^ df^ rt ] : Just because y our gaze is also correlat ed wit h t he
direct ionalit y of your voice .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s^ am ] : Could be .
m e013 [ s^ aa.%−] : Yeah . That would be t ou
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Oh , t hat would be int erest ing .
fe008 [ qy .%−] : Can we
m n005 [ b.%] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s.%−] : Yeah , so t hat , I m ean , t o even know um when
[ disfm arker]

fe016 [ s] : Yeah , if y ou have t he P Z Ms y ou should be able t o pick up
what a person is looking at from t heir v oice .
m e011 [ s] : Well , especially wit h Morgan , wit h t he way we have t he
m icrophones arranged . I ’m sort of right on axis
m e011 [ s] : and it would be very hard t o t ell .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e011 [ fh] : Uh .
fe008 [ s^ arp.%−] : Oh , but you ’d have t he [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ co] : Put Morgan alway s like t his
fe016 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−] : You ’d have faint er [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−] : Well , t hese [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : Wouldn’t you get faint er recept ion out here ?
m e011 [ s^ aap^ rt .%−−] : Sure , but I t hink if I ’m t alking like t his ?
m e011 [ s] : Right now I ’m looking at Jane and t alking ,
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : now I ’m looking at Chuck and t alking ,
m e011 [ s] : I don’t t hink t he m icrophones would pick up t hat difference
.
fe016 [ s^ ng] : But you don’t have t his [ disfm arker] t his problem .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : I see .
fe016 [ s^ j] : Morgan is t he one who does t his m ost .
m e011 [ s] : So if I ’m t alking at you , or I ’m t alking at you .
m e013 [ s^ df.x] : I probably been affect No , I t h I t hink I ’ve been

som ebody going t o say som et hing bad ? " and so on .
m e011 [ s^ 2^ rt ] : Lawyers .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : And so I [ disfm arker] so I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m t ending
t o st ay away from people ’s nam es even t hough uh [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ na] : I am t oo .
fe016 [ s] : Ev en t hough you could pick up lat er on , just from t he

m n005 [ s^ rt ] : i and y ou use t he eh speech file collect ed by t he eh fet

[ pause] wit h t he [ disfm arker] t he syst em ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m n005 [ s] : it s possible t o evaluat e eh , eh [ disfm arker] or t o consider

m e011 [ fg] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ df] : The [ disfm arker] t he reason t hat I generat ed t he m ixed

t ranscript ion .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s^ ba] : Yeah . Oh , it ’s a good idea .
m n005 [ s^ ba^ r] : It ’s a good idea I t hink .
m e011 [ s] : So I agree t hat if som eone want s t o do speech event
t ranscript ion , t hat t he m ixed signals here [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , if I ’m t apping on t he t able , you it ’s not gonna

t he PZM .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s^ cs] : So and I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] I say
eh t hat eh , eh , or t his eh only because eh I c I [ disfm arker] I
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] in m y opinion , it ’s necessary t o eh
[ disfm arker] t o eh [ disfm arker] t o put t he t ranscript ion on t he speech

m e013 [ s^ 2] : The [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he far − field ,
m e013 [ b] : yeah .
m n005 [ s^ co] : y ou have t o [ disfm arker] t o analyze [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s^ co] : you have t o [ disfm arker] t o process .
m n005 [ s^ df] : Because I [ disfm arker] I found a difference .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah , well , just [ disfm arker] I m ean , just in t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat one s t en second , or what ever it was , exam ple t hat
Adam had t hat [ disfm arker] t hat we [ disfm arker] we passed on t o

m e013 [ fh|s] : and [ disfm arker] and uh , in t he close − t alking m ikes
y ou couldn’t hear t he overlap , and in t he dist ant m ike you could .
m e013 [ fh|s^ cs] : So yeah , it ’s clear t hat if you wanna st udy
[ disfm arker] if y ou wanna find all t he places where t here were overlap ,
it ’s probably bet t er t o use a dist ant m ike .
m n017 [ s^ ba] : That ’s good .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : On t he ot her hand , t here ’s ot her phenom ena t hat
are going on at t he sam e t im e for which it m ight be useful t o look at
t he close − t alking m ikes ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−] : so it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ qw] : But why can’t you use t he com binat ion of t he close −
t alking m ikes , t im e aligned ?
m e011 [ s^ df] : If you use t he com binat ion of t he close − t alking m ikes ,
y ou would hear Jane int errupt ing m e ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : but you wouldn’t hear t he paper rust ling .
m e011 [ s.%−] : And so if you ’re int erest ed in [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I m ean if you ’re int erest ed in speakers

t hat ’s not a problem ,
m e013 [ s^ ng] : Som e [ com m ent ] of it ’s m asking [ disfm arker] m asked

weren’t here for an earlier conv ersat ion .
fe016 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe016 [ s^ fa] : I ’m sorry .
m e013 [ s^ bs] : So t he idea was t hat what he was going t o be doing
was ex perim ent ing wit h different m easures
m e013 [ s^ e.%−−] : such as t he increase in energy , such as t he energy
in t he LPC residuals , such as [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean t here ’s a bunch of t hings [ disfm arker] I m ean ,
increased energy is − is sort of an obvious one .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ bu] : In t he far − field m ike .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Um , and uh , it ’s not obvious ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : I m ean , you could [ disfm arker] you could do t he
dum best t hing and get [ disfm arker] get it ninet y percent of t he t im e .
m e013 [ s] : But when you st art going past t hat and t rying t o do bet t er
, it ’s not obv ious what com binat ion of feat ures is gonna give you t he
[ disfm arker] you know , t he right det ect or .
m e013 [ s] : So t he idea is t o have som e ground t rut h first .
m e013 [ s] : And so t he i t he idea of t he m anual m arking was t o say "
OK t his , i you know , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s really here " .
m e018 [ s^ bu:qw^ cs] : But I t hink Liz is saying why not get it out of t he
t ranscript s ?
fe016 [ s^ df] : What I m ean is [ pause] get it from t he close − t alking
m ikes .
m e013 [ h|s^ no^ rt ] : Uh , yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : A or ge get a first pass from t hose ,

m e013 [ s^ aa] : We t we t w we t we t alked about t hat .
fe016 [ s^ e.%−−] : and t hen go t hrough sort of [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−] : It ’d be a lot fast er probably t o [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−] : And you can [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.%−] : Yeah , t hat ’s his , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa^ r] : We [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] we t alked about
t hat .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : s But so it ’s a boot st rapping t hing and t he t hing is ,
fe016 [ s^ bk|%−] : Yeah , I just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bs^ rt ] : t he idea was , i we i i we t hought it would be useful
for him t o look at t he dat a any way ,
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and t hen what ever he could m ark would
be helpful ,
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and we could [ disfm arker] Uh
m e013 [ s] : it ’s a quest ion of what y ou boot st rap from .
m e013 [ qy ] : You know , do you boot st rap from a sim ple m easurem ent
which is right m ost of t he t im e and t hen you g do bet t er ,
m e013 [ qrr] : or do you boot st rap from som e hum an being looking at it
and t hen [ disfm arker] t hen do your sim ple m easurem ent s , uh from
t he close − t alking m ike .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , even wit h t he close − t alking m ike you ’re not
gonna get it right all t he t im e .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : Well , t hat ’s what I wonder , because um [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : or how bad it is ,
m e013 [ fg] : Well
m e011 [ s.%−] : I ’m working on a program t o do t hat , and [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fg|s^ ba] : be um , because t hat would be int erest ing
fe016 [ s] : especially because t he bot t leneck is t he t ranscript ion .
fe016 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , we ’ve got a lot m ore dat a t han we have
t ranscript ions for .
fe016 [ s^ e] : We have t he audio dat a ,
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ e] : we hav e t he close − t alking m ike ,
fe016 [ s.%−−] : so I m ean it seem s like one kind of project
fe016 [ s.%−−] : t hat ’s not perfect , but [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fh|s.%−−] : um , t hat you can get t he t raining dat a for pret t y
quickly is , y ou know ,
fe016 [ s] : if you infer form t he close − t alking m ikes where t he on − off
point s are of speech ,
m e013 [ s^ aa|s] : Right , we discussed t hat .
fe016 [ fh|qw] : you know , how can we det ect t hat from a far − field ?
m e011 [ fg] : And [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Oh .
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : I ’ve [ disfm arker] I ’v e writ t en a program t o do t hat ,

fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e011 [ s.%−] : and it , uh [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ fa.%−] : I ’m sorry I m issed t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bd] : It ’s OK .
m e011 [ fh|s] : and [ disfm arker] so [ disfm arker] but it ’s [ disfm arker] it
’s doing som et hing v ery , very sim ple .
m e011 [ s^ e] : It just t akes a t hreshold , based on [ disfm arker] on t he
v olum e ,
fe016 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n017 [ s^ cs] : Or y ou can set t he t hreshold low and t hen weed out
t he false alarm s by hand .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right ,
fe016 [ s^ aa^ m ] : by hand . Yeah .
m n017 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fg|s^ e] : um , and t hen it does a m edian filt er , and t hen it
looks for runs .
m e011 [ s] : And , it seem s t o work ,
m e011 [ s] : I ’v e [ disfm arker] I ’m sort of fiddling wit h t he param et ers ,
t o get it t o act ually generat e som et hing ,
m e011 [ s.%−−] : and I haven’t [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : I don’t [ disfm arker] what I ’m working on [ disfm arker] was
working on [ disfm arker] was get t ing it t o a form where we can im port it
int o t he user int erface t hat we have , [ pause] int o Transcriber .
m e011 [ fh|s^ cc] : And so [ disfm arker] I t old [ disfm arker] I said it would
t ake about a day .
m e011 [ s] : I ’v e worked on it for about half a day ,
m e001 [ s] : I have t o go .
m e011 [ fh|s^ cc] : so give m e anot her half day and I we ’ll have
som et hing we can play wit h .
fe016 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ co] : See , t his is where we really need t he Meet ing
Recorder query st uff t o be working ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : because we ’ve had t hese m eet ings and we ’ve had
t his discussion about t his , and I ’m sort of rem em bering a lit t le bit
about what we decided ,
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ fe] : I ’m sorry .
fe016 [ %−] : I just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : but I couldn’t rem em ber all of it .
fe016 [ %−] : It
m e013 [ fh|s] : So , I t hink it was part ly t hat , you know , give som ebody
a chance t o act ually look at t he dat a and see what t hese are like ,
part ly t hat we have e som e ground t rut h t o com pare against , you
know , when [ disfm arker] when he [ disfm arker] he get s his t hing going
,
m e011 [ fg] : But [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ fh|%−] : uh , and [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ ba] : Well , it ’s definit ely good t o have som ebody look at it .
fe016 [ s^ df.%−] : I was just t hinking as a way t o speed up you know ,
t he am ount of [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : That was [ disfm arker] t hat was exact ly t he not ion t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat we discussed .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ ft ^ t 3.%] : Thanks .
fe008 [ s^ t .%−] : Anot her t hing we discussed was um t hat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : So .
fe016 [ s^ ba^ t 3] : It looks good .
fe016 [ s^ cc^ t 3] : I ’ll be in t ouch .
fe016 [ s^ ft ^ t 3] : Thanks .
m e013 [ s^ t 3] : S See ya .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bu] : Was t hat um t here m [ pause] t here was t his already a
script I believ e uh t hat Dan had writ t en , [ com m ent ] t hat uh handle
bleedt hrough ,
fe008 [ fh|s^ df] : I m ean cuz you have t his [ disfm arker] t his close
[ disfm arker] you hav e cont am inat ion from ot her people who speak
loudly .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e011 [ s] : and I haven’t t ried using t hat .
m e011 [ s] : It would probably help t he program t hat I ’m doing t o first
feed it t hrough t hat .
m e011 [ s^ e] : It ’s a cross − correlat ion filt er .
m e011 [ s] : So I [ disfm arker] I haven’t t ried t hat , but t hat [ disfm arker]
If [ disfm arker] It [ disfm arker] it m ight be som et hing [ disfm arker] it
m ight be a good way of cleaning it up a lit t le .
fe008 [ s.%−] : So , som e t hought of m aybe having [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : Yeah , having t hat be a preprocessor and t hen run it
t hrough y ours .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Ex act ly . Yep .
m e013 [ s^ aap] : But [ disfm arker] but t hat ’s a refinem ent
fe008 [ s^ t ] : That ’s what we were discussing .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and I t hink we wanna see [ disfm arker] t ry t he sim ple
t hing first ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : cuz y ou add t his com plex t hing up uh aft erwards t hat
does som et hing good y y yo you sort of wanna see what t he sim ple
t hing does first .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ s] : But uh , having [ disfm arker] having som ebody have som e
ex perience , again , wit h [ disfm arker] wit h uh [ disfm arker] wit h m arking
it from a hum an st andpoint ,

m e013 [ s] : we ’re [ disfm arker] I m ean , I don’t expect Jose t o
[ disfm arker] t o do it for uh f fift y hours of [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] of
speech ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : but I m ean we [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] if uh
[ disfm arker] if he could speed up what he was doing by just get t ing
t he speaker ov erlaps so t hat we had it , say , for fort y − five m inut es ,
t hen at least we ’d have t hree hundred exam ples of it .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah . Sure .
m n005 [ b] : Sure .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : And when [ disfm arker] when uh Adam was doing his
aut om at ic t hing he could t hen com pare t o t hat and see what it was
different .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Oh y eah , definit ely .
m e018 [ s] : You know , I did [ disfm arker] I did uh som et hing alm ost
ident ical t o t his at one of m y prev ious jobs , and it works pret t y well .
m e018 [ s] : I m ean , i alm ost exact ly what you described , an energy
det ect or wit h a m edian filt er , you look for runs .
m e018 [ fh] : And uh ,
m e018 [ s.%−] : y ou know , you can [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : It seem ed like t he right t hing t o do .
m e018 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah . I m ean , y ou [ disfm arker] you can get y I m ean
, you get t hem pret t y close .
m e011 [ s] : That was wit h zero lit erat ure search .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : And so I t hink doing t hat t o generat e t hese
possibilit ies and t hen going t hrough and saying yes or no on t hem
would be a quick way t o [ disfm arker] t o do it .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : That ’s good validat ion .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t his propriet ary ?
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Yeah , do you have a pat ent on it ?
m e018 [ h|s^ ar] : Uh . [ com m ent ] No . No .
m e018 [ s] : It was when I was working for t he governm ent .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh , t hen everybody owns it .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s t he people .
fe008 [ qy ] : Well , I m ean , is t his som et hing t hat we could just co − opt
,
fe008 [ qrr.%−−] : or is it [ disfm arker] ?
fe008 [ s^ bk^ m ] : No .
m e018 [ s^ ar] : Nah .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s.%−] : Well , i i i he ’s pret t y close , anyway . I t hink
[ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , he ’s [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it doesn’t t ake
a long t im e .
fe008 [ b] : Right .

fe008 [ s] : I just t hought if it was t ried and t rue , t hen [ disfm arker]
[ com m ent ] and he ’s gone t hrough addit ional levels of [ disfm arker] of
developm ent .
m e011 [ s] : Just out put .
m e011 [ qw] : Alt hough if you [ disfm arker] if you have som e param et ers
like what ’s a good window size for t he m edian filt er [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ h|s^ no] : Oh ! [ com m ent ] I have t o rem em ber .
m e018 [ s^ cc] : I ’ll t hink about it ,
m e018 [ s^ cc^ e] : and t ry t o rem em ber .
m n017 [ s] : And it m ight be different for governm ent people .
m e011 [ s^ ba.%] : That ’s alright .
m e013 [ s^ j.x] : Yeah , good enough for governm ent work , as t hey say
.
fe016 [ %−] : They [ disfm arker] t hey [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : Di − dif different [ disfm arker] different bandwidt h .
m n017 [ %−] : They
m e011 [ s] : I was doing pret t y short , you know , t ent h of a second ,
[ com m ent ] sort s of num bers .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ fg|s^ no.%−−] : Uh , I don’t know , it [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] if
we want t o uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s^ t c] : So , uh , m aybe we should m ove on t o ot her
[ disfm arker] ot her t hings in lim it ed t im e .
fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : Can I ask one quest ion about his st at ist ics ?
fe008 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so in t he t w t welve m inut es , um , if we t ook
t hree hundred and divided it by four , which is about t he lengt h of
t welve m inut es , i Um , I ’d expect like t here should be sevent y − five
ov erlaps .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ qr.%−] : Did you find uh m ore t han sevent y − five overlaps in t hat
period , or [ disfm arker] ?
m n005 [ qy ^ rt ] : More t han ?
fe008 [ s^ m .%−−] : More t han [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ qw] : How m any overlaps in your t welve m inut es ?
m n005 [ qw^ m ] : How m any ?
m n005 [ %−−] : Eh , not @ @ I
m n005 [ s.%−−] : Onl − only I [ disfm arker] I t ranscribe eh only t welve
m inut es from t he
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ fg|s] : but eh I [ disfm arker] I don’t co eh [ disfm arker] I don’t
count eh t he [ disfm arker] t he overlap .
fe008 [ s^ 2] : The overlaps .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n005 [ s] : I consider I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] The [ disfm arker] t he
nnn [ disfm arker] The [ disfm arker] t he t hree hundred is eh considered
only y ou [ disfm arker] your t ranscript ion .

m n005 [ s] : I have t o [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t o finish t ranscribing .
m n005 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ s] : I b I bet t hey ’re m ore , because t he beginning of t he
m eet ing had a lot m ore overlaps t han [ disfm arker] t han sort of t he
m iddle .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ bsc] : Middle or end .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : Because i we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re dealing wit h t he
[ disfm arker] Uh , in t he early m eet ings ,
fe008 [ s^ no] : I ’m not sure .
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : we ’re recording while we ’re saying who ’s t alking on
what m icrophone , [ com m ent ] and t hings like t hat ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : and t hat seem s t o be a lot of overlap .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : I t hink it ’s an em pirical quest ion .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : I t hink we could find t hat out .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
fe008 [ s^ no] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m not sure t hat t he beginning had
m ore .
m e013 [ s^ t ] : So [ disfm arker] so I was gonna ask , I guess about any
[ disfm arker] any ot her t hings t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
eit her of you want ed t o t alk about ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : especially since Andreas is leaving in five m inut es ,
m e013 [ s] : t hat [ disfm arker] t hat you wanna go wit h .
fe016 [ qy ^ rt ] : Can I just ask about t he dat a ,
fe016 [ qw^ rt ] : like very st raight forward quest ion is where we are on
t he am ount of dat a and t he am ount of t ranscribed dat a ,
fe016 [ s^ df.%−−] : just cuz I ’m [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : I want ed t o get a feel for t hat
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : t o sort of be able t o know what [ disfm arker] what can be
done first
fe016 [ qw] : and like how m any m eet ings are we recording
m e013 [ fg|s] : Right so t here ’s t his [ disfm arker] t his [ disfm arker]
There ’s t his fort y − five m inut e piece t hat Jane t ranscribed .
fe016 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : That piece was t hen uh sent t o IBM so t hey could
t ranscribe so we have som e com parison point .
m e013 [ s.x ] : Then t here ’s s a larger piece t hat ’s been recorded and
uh put on CD − ROM and sent uh t o IBM .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s^ no] : And t hen we don’t know .
fe016 [ qw^ rt ] : How m any m eet ings is t hat ?
m e011 [ qw^ bu^ rt ] : What ’s t hat ?

fe016 [ qw^ r.%−] : Like [ disfm arker] how m any [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : That was about t en hours , and t here was about
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ qo^ bu^ d^ rt ] : t t en [ disfm arker] It ’s like t en m eet ings or
som et hing ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , som et hing like t hat .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m e011 [ %−] : And t hen [ disfm arker] t hen we
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Ten m eet ings t hat have been sent t o IBM ?
fe016 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ng] : Well , I haven’t sent t hem yet because I was having
t his problem wit h t he [ pause] m issing files .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh , t hat ’s right , t hat had [ disfm arker] t hose have
not been sent .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : H how m any t ot al have we recorded now , alt oget her ?
m e013 [ s] : We ’re saying about [ pause] t welve hours .
m e011 [ s] : About t welve [ pause] by now . Twelve or t hirt een .
fe016 [ s] : Uh − huh . And we ’re recording only t his m eet ing , like
cont inuously
fe016 [ qr^ bu^ d.%−] : we ’re only recording t his one now ? or
[ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e011 [ s^ ar] : Nope .
m e013 [ s^ ar|s^ rt ] : No , so t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t hat ’s
t he [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he biggest one [ disfm arker] uh , chunk so far ,
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ ng] : It was t he m orning one .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : but t here ’s at least one m eet ing recorded of uh t he uh
uh nat ural language guys .
m e011 [ s] : Jerry .
fe016 [ qy ^ rt ] : Do t hey m eet every week ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : And t hen t here [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ h|s^ aa^ rt ] : Uh , t hey do .
fe016 [ qrr.%−] : or every [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : w w And we t alked t o t hem about recording som e m ore
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and we ’re going t o ,
m e013 [ fh|s^ rt ] : uh , we ’ve st art ed having a m orning m eet ing , t oday
uh i st art ing a w a week or t wo ago , on t he uh front − end issues ,
m e013 [ s] : and we ’re recording t hose ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh t here ’s a net work services and applicat ions group
here who ’s agreed t o have t heir m eet ings recorded ,
fe016 [ s^ ba] : Great .
m e013 [ s] : and we ’re gonna st art recording t hem .

m e013 [ s] : They ’re [ disfm arker] They m eet on Tuesdays . We ’re
gonna st art recording t hem nex t week .
m e013 [ s] : So act ually , we ’re gonna h st art having a [ disfm arker] a
pret t y significant chunk
m e013 [ fh] : and
m e013 [ fh|s] : so , y ou know , [ vocalsound] Adam ’s sort of st ruggling
wit h t ry ing t o get t hings t o be less buggy , and com e up quicker when
t hey do crash and st uff [ disfm arker] t hings like t hat ,
m e013 [ s] : now t hat uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t he t hings are
st art ing t o happen .
m e013 [ s] : So right now , yeah , I t h I ’d say t he dat a is predom inant ly
m eet ing m eet ings ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : but t here are scat t ered ot her m eet ings in it and t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat am ount is gonna grow
m e013 [ s.%−−] : uh so t hat t he m eet ing m eet ings will probably
ult im at ely [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : i if we ’re [ disfm arker] if we collect fift y or sixt y hours , t he
m eet ing m eet ings it will probably be , you know , t went y or t hirt y
percent of it ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : not [ disfm arker] not [ disfm arker] not eight y or ninet y .
m e013 [ fh] : But .
fe016 [ s^ bs] : So t here ’s probably [ disfm arker] t here ’s t hree t o four
a week ,
m e011 [ s^ na] : That ’s what we ’re aim ing for .
fe016 [ s^ bk^ m ] : t hat we ’re aim ing for .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ bu] : And t hey ’re each about an hour or som et hing .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
m e011 [ %−−] : Alt hough [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : We ’ll find out t om orrow whet her we can really do t his or
not .
fe016 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ no.%−−] : Yeah and t h t he [ disfm arker] t he ot her t hing is I ’m
not pos
fe016 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ no.%−−] : I ’m sort of t hinking as we ’ve been t hrough t his a
few t im es , t hat I really don’t know [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : m aybe you wanna do it once for t he novelt y ,
m e013 [ s^ no] : but I don’t know if in general we wanna have m eet ings
t hat we record from out side t his group do t he digit s .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ df] : Because it ’s just an added bunch of weird st uff .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : And , you know , we [ disfm arker] we h we ’re highly
m ot ivat ed .

m e013 [ s] : Uh in fact , t he m orning group is really m ot ivat ed
m e013 [ s^ df] : cuz t hey ’re working on connect ed digit s ,
m e013 [ %−] : so it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Act ually t hat ’s som et hing I want ed t o ask ,
m e011 [ s] : is I have a bunch of script s t o help wit h t he t ranscript ion of
t he digit s .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : We don’t have t o hand − t ranscribe t he digit s because we
’re reading t hem and I have t hose .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : And so I have som e script s t hat let you very quickly ext ract
t he sect ions of each ut t erance .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : But I haven’t been ru I haven’t been doing t hat .
m e011 [ fh|qy ^ rt ] : Um , if I did t hat , is som eone gonna be working on
it ?
m e013 [ h|s^ aa] : Uh , yeah , I [ disfm arker] I t hink
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : I m ean , is it som et hing of int erest ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : definit ely s so Absolut ely .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Yeah , whoever we have working on t he acoust ics for
t he Meet ing Recorder are gonna st art wit h t hat .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , I I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m int erest ed in it ,
m e011 [ s] : I just don’t have t im e t o do it now .
m n017 [ s] : I was [ disfm arker] t hese m eet ings [ disfm arker] I ’m sure
som eone t hought of t his , but t hese [ disfm arker] t his uh reading of
t he num bers would be ext rem ely helpful t o do um adapt at ion .
m e011 [ fh] : So
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep . Yep .
m n017 [ fh] : Um .
fe016 [ s.%−] : Act ually I have o
m e011 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I would really like som eone t o do adapt at ion
.
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : So if we got som eone int erest ed in t hat , I t hink it
would be great for Meet ing Recorder .
m e013 [ fg] : Well [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ cs] : I m ean , one of t he t hings I want ed t o do , uh , t hat I I
t alked t o [ disfm arker] t o Don about , is one of t he possible t hings he
could do or m also , we could have som eone else do it , is t o do block
echo cancellat ion ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : Since it ’s t he sam e people over and over .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ df] : t o t ry t o get rid of som e of t he effect s of t he
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he far − field effect s .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , I m ean we have [ disfm arker] t he part y line has
been t hat echo cancellat ion is not t he right way t o handle t he
sit uat ion
m e013 [ s^ df] : because people m ov e around ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : and uh , if [ disfm arker] if it ’s [ disfm arker] if it ’s uh not a
sim ple echo , like a cross − t alk kind of echo , but it ’s act ually room
acoust ics , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] you can’t
really do inv ersion ,
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : and even echo cancellat ion is going t o uh be som et hing
[ disfm arker] It m ay [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker] Som eone m ay be
m ov ing enough t hat y ou are not able t o adapt quickly
m e013 [ s] : and so t he t ack t hat we ’ve t aken is m ore " let s com e up
wit h feat ure approaches and m ult i − st ream approaches and so fort h ,
t hat will be robust t o it for t he recognizer and not t ry t o creat e a clean
signal " .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , t hat ’s t he part y line .
m e013 [ s] : But it occurred t o m e a few m ont hs ago t hat uh part y lines
are alway s , y ou know , sort of dangerous .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : It ’s good [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] good t o sort of
t est t hem , act ually .
m e013 [ s] : And so we haven’t had any body t ry t o do a good serious
job on echo cancellat ion and we should know how well t hat can do .
m e013 [ fh|s^ cs] : So t hat ’s som et hing I ’d like som ebody t o do at
som e point , just t ake t hese digit s , t ake t he far − field m ike signal ,
and t he close uh m ike signal , and apply really good echo cancellat ion
.
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um , t here was a [ disfm arker] have been som e nice
t alks recent ly by [ disfm arker] by Lucent on [ disfm arker] on t heir b
m n017 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s] : t he block echo cancellat ion part icularly appealed t o m e ,
m e013 [ fh|s.%−] : uh you know , t rying and change it sam ple by sam ple
, but y ou hav e som e reasonable sized blocks . [ com m ent ] And um , you
know , t h
m e018 [ qw^ rt .x ] : W what is t he um [ disfm arker] t he art ifact you t ry t o
[ disfm arker] you ’re t rying t o get rid of when you do t hat ?
m n017 [ s.%] : Ciao .
m e013 [ h|s.%−−] : Uh so it ’s [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] you have a
[ disfm arker] a direct uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : Uh , what ’s t he difference in [ disfm arker] If you were
t ry ing t o const ruct a linear filt er , t hat would
m e013 [ fh.x ] : um [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : I ’m signing off .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s^ e] : t hat would subt ract off [ com m ent ] t he um uh part s of
t he signal t hat were t he aspect s of t he signal t hat were different
bet ween t he close − t alk and t he dist ant .
m e013 [ fh|s^ e] : You know , so [ disfm arker] so uh um I guess in m ost
echo cancellat ion [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : Yeah , so you [ disfm arker] Given t hat um
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s] : Yeah , so you ’re t rying t o [ disfm arker] So you ’d
[ disfm arker] There ’s a [ disfm arker] a dist ance bet ween t he close and
t he dist ant m ikes so t here ’s a t im e delay t here ,
m e013 [ s] : and aft er t he t im e delay , t here ’s t hese various reflect ions
.
m e013 [ s.%−] : And if you figure out well what ’s t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : t here ’s a [ disfm arker] a least squares algorit hm t hat
adjust s it self [ disfm arker] adjust s t he weight so t hat you t ry t o
subt ract [ disfm arker] essent ially t o subt ract off uh different uh
[ disfm arker] different reflect ions .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Right ? So let ’s t ake t he sim ple case where you just
had [ disfm arker] y ou had som e uh som e delay in a sat ellit e connect ion
or som et hing
m e013 [ s] : and t hen t here ’s a [ disfm arker] t here ’s an echo .
m e013 [ s] : It com es back . And you want t o adjust t his filt er so t hat it
will m axim ally reduce t he effect of t his echo .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : So t hat would m ean like if you were list ening t o t he
dat a t hat was recorded on one of t hose .
m e018 [ fh|s] : Uh , just t he raw dat a ,
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : y ou would [ disfm arker] you m ight hear kind of an
echo ?
m e018 [ s.%−−] : And [ disfm arker] and t hen t his [ disfm arker] noise
cancellat ion would get
m e013 [ s^ ng.%−−] : Well , I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m saying
[ disfm arker] That ’s a sim plified v ersion of what ’s really happening .
[ com m ent ] What ’s really happening is [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Well , when I ’m t alking t o you right now , you ’re get t ing
t he direct sound from m y speech ,
m e013 [ s] : but you ’re also get t ing , uh , t he indirect sound t hat ’s
bounced around t he room a num ber of t im es .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ rt ] : OK ?
m e013 [ s] : So now , if you um t ry t o r y ou [ disfm arker] To com plet ely
rem ove t he effect of t hat is sort of im pract ical for a num ber of
t echnical reasons ,
m e013 [ %−−] : but I [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : not t o t ry t o com plet ely rem ove it , t hat is , invert t he
[ disfm arker] t he room response ,
m e013 [ s] : but just t o t ry t o uh uh elim inat e som e of t he [ disfm arker]
t he effect of som e of t he echos .

m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , a num ber of people have done t his
m e013 [ s] : so t hat , say , if you ’re t alking t o a speakerphone , uh it
m akes it m ore like it would be , if y ou were t alking right up t o it .
m e013 [ s] : So t his is sort of t he st t he st raight − forward approach .
m e013 [ s] : You say I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I want t o use t his uh
[ disfm arker] t his it em but I want t o subt ract off various kinds of echos .
m e013 [ s] : So you const ruct a filt er , and you have t his [ disfm arker]
t his filt ered v ersion uh of t he speech um get s uh uh [ disfm arker] get s
subt ract ed off from t he original speech .
m e013 [ s] : Then y ou t ry t o [ disfm arker] you t ry t o m inim ize t he energy
in som e sense .
m e013 [ fh|s] : And so um [ disfm arker] uh wit h som e const raint s .
m e018 [ s^ bu.%−−] : Kind of a clean up t hing , t hat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa^ m ] : It ’s a clean up t hing . Right .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ fg|s] : So , echo cancelling is [ disfm arker] is , you know ,
com m only done in t elephony ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and it ’s sort of t he
obvious t hing t o do in t his sit uat ion if you [ disfm arker] if , you know ,
y ou ’re gonna be t alking som e dist ance from a m ike .
m e018 [ s] : When uh , I would have m eet ings wit h t he folks in
Cam bridge when I was at BBN over t he phone , t hey had a um
[ disfm arker] som e kind of a special speaker phone
m e018 [ s] : and when t hey would first connect m e , it would com e on
and we ’d hear all t his noise .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : And t hen it was uh [ disfm arker] And t hen it would com e on
and it was very clear ,
m e018 [ qy^ d^ f] : you know .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s] : Right . So it ’s t aking sam ples , it ’s doing adapt at ion
, it ’s adjust ing weight s ,
m e013 [ s] : and t hen it ’s get t ing t he sum .
m e013 [ fh|s.x] : So um , uh anyway t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s kind of a
reasonable t hing t hat I ’d like t o have som ebody t ry [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : som ebody look [ disfm arker] And [ disfm arker] and t he
digit s would be a reasonable t hing t o do t hat wit h .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink t hat ’d be enough dat a [ disfm arker] plent y of dat a
t o do t hat wit h ,
m e013 [ s] : and i for t hat sort of t ask y ou wouldn’t care whet her it was
uh large vocabulary speech or anyt hing .
m e013 [ b] : Uh . [ v ocalsound] Um
fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is Brian Kingsbury ’s work relat ed t o t hat ,
fe008 [ qrr] : or is it a different t ype of reverberat ion ?
m e013 [ s] : Brian ’s [ com m ent ] Kingsbury ’s work is an exam ple of what
we did f f from t he opposit e dogm a .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?

m e013 [ s:s] : Which is what I was calling t he " part y line " , which is t hat
uh doing t hat sort of t hing is not really what we want .
m e013 [ s] : We want som et hing m ore flexible , uh i i where people
m ight change t heir posit ion ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and t here m ight be , you know [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−−] : There ’s also um
m e013 [ s^ fe] : oh yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : noise .
m e013 [ s] : So t he echo cancellat ion does not really allow for noise .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s if y ou have a clean sit uat ion but you just have som e
delay s ,
m e013 [ s] : Then we ’ll figure out t he right [ disfm arker] t he right set of
weight s for y our t aps for your filt er in order t o produce t he effect of
t hose [ disfm arker] t hose echos .
m e013 [ fh|s] : But um if t here ’s noise , t hen t he very signal t hat it ’s
looking at is corrupt ed
m e013 [ s] : so t hat it ’s decision about what t he right [ disfm arker] you
know , right [ disfm arker] right uh [ disfm arker] delays are [ disfm arker]
is , uh [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] right delayed signal is [ disfm arker] is
[ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] uh is incorrect .
m e013 [ s] : And so , in a noisy sit uat ion , um , also in a [ disfm arker] in
a sit uat ion t hat ’s v ery reverberant [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] wit h long
rev erberat ion t im es [ com m ent ] and really long delays , it ’s
[ disfm arker] it ’s sort of t ypically im pract ical .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So for t hose kind of reasons ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and also a [ disfm arker] a c a com plet e inversion ,
m e013 [ s] : if y ou act ually [ disfm arker] I m ent ioned t hat it ’s kind of
hard t o really do t he inversion of t he room acoust ics .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , t hat ’s difficult because um oft en t im es t he
[ disfm arker] t he um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t he syst em t ransfer
funct ion is such t hat when it ’s invert ed you get som et hing t hat ’s
unst able ,
m e013 [ s] : and so , if you [ disfm arker] you do your est im at e of what
t he sy st em is , and t hen you t ry t o inv ert it , you get a filt er t hat
act ually uh , you know , rings , and [ disfm arker] and uh goes t o infinit y
.
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] so t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s
[ disfm arker] t here ’s t hat sort of t echnical reason , and t he fact t hat
t hings m ov e , and t here ’s air current s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean t here ’s all sort s of [ disfm arker] all sort s of reasons
why it ’s not really pract ical .
m e013 [ s] : So for all t hose kinds of reasons , uh we [ disfm arker] we
[ disfm arker] we sort of um , concluded we didn’t want t o in do
inv ersion ,
m e013 [ s] : and we ’re even pret t y skept ical of echo cancellat ion ,
which isn’t really inv ersion ,

m e013 [ fh|s] : and um we decided t o do t his approach of t aking
[ disfm arker] uh , just picking uh feat ures , which were [ disfm arker] uh
will giv e y ou m ore [ disfm arker] som et hing t hat was m ore st able , in t he
presence of , or absence of , room reverberat ion ,
m e013 [ s] : and t hat ’s what Brian was t rying t o do .
m e013 [ fh|s^ t c] : So , um , let m e just say a couple t hings t hat I was
[ disfm arker] I was gonna bring up .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh . Let ’s see . I guess you [ disfm arker] you act ually
already said t his t hing about t he uh [ disfm arker] about t he consent
form s ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : which was t hat we now don’t have t o [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ d.%−−] : So t his was t he hum an subject s folks who said t his
, [ com m ent ] or t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] ?
fe008 [ s] : The a apparent ly [ disfm arker] I m ean , we ’re gonna do a
rev ised form , of course .
fe008 [ fh] : Um
fe008 [ s] : but once a person has signed it once , t hen t hat ’s valid for
a cert ain num ber of m eet ings .
fe008 [ s] : She want ed m e t o act ually est im at e how m any m eet ings
and put t hat on t he consent form .
fe008 [ s] : I t old her t hat would be a lit t le bit difficult t o say .
fe008 [ s] : So I t hink from a s pract ical st andpoint , m aybe we could
have t hem do it once every t en m eet ings , or som et hing .
fe008 [ s] : It won’t be t hat m any people who do it [ pause] t hat oft en ,
fe008 [ fh|s] : but um just , you know , so long as t hey don’t forget t hat
t hey ’v e done it , I guess .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ fg|s^ t ] : Um , back on t he dat a t hing ,
m e013 [ s] : so t here ’s t his sort of one hour , t en hour , a hundred
hour sort of t hing t hat [ disfm arker] t hat we hav e .
m e013 [ s] : We have [ disfm arker] we hav e an hour uh t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat is t ranscribed ,
m e013 [ s] : we hav e [ disfm arker] we hav e t welve hours t hat ’s
recorded but not t ranscribed ,
m e013 [ s] : and at t he rat e we ’re going , uh by t he end of t he
sem est er we ’ll have , I don’t know , fort y or fift y or som et hing , if we
[ disfm arker] if t his really
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy] : Well , do we have t hat m uch ?
fe016 [ s^ ar] : Not really .
m e013 [ s^ t 1] : Let ’s see ,
m e013 [ %−] : we hav e [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : It ’s t hree t o four per week .
fe016 [ fh|s.%−] : So t hat ’s what [ disfm arker] You know , t hat
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : uh eight weeks , uh is [ disfm arker]

fe016 [ s] : So t hat ’s not a lot of hours .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : Eight weeks t im es t hree hours is t went y − four , so t hat
’s [ disfm arker] Yeah , so like t hirt y [ disfm arker] t hirt y hours ?
m e018 [ s^ m ] : Three [ disfm arker] Three hours .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ qy^ rt .%−−] : I m ean , is t here [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : I know t his sounds [ pause] t ough but we ’ve got t he room
set up .
fe016 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um I was st art ing t o t hink of som e project s where you
would use
fe016 [ fh|s] : well , sim ilar t o what we t alked about wit h uh energy
det ect ion on t he close − t alking m ikes .
fe016 [ s] : There are a num ber of int erest ing quest ions t hat you can
ask about how int eract ions happen in a m eet ing , t hat don’t require
any t ranscript ion .
fe016 [ qw] : So what are t he pat t erns , t he energy pat t erns over t he
m eet ing ?
fe016 [ s] : And I ’m really int erest ed in t his [ vocalsound] but we don’t
have a whole lot of dat a .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : So I was t hinking , y ou know , we ’ve got t he room set
up
fe016 [ fh|s^ cs] : and you can alway s t hink of , also for polit ical
reasons , if ICSI collect ed you know , t wo hundred hours , t hat looks
different t han fort y hours , even if we don’t t ranscribe it ourselves ,
m e013 [ s^ arp] : But I don’t t hink we ’re gonna st op at t he end of t his
sem est er .
fe016 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s] : So , I t h I t hink t hat if we are able t o keep t hat up for a few
m ont hs , we are gonna have m ore like a hundred hours .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , is t here [ disfm arker] Are t here any ot her
m eet ings here t hat we can record , especially m eet ings t hat have
som e kind of conflict in t hem [ com m ent ] or som e kind of deci
fe016 [ s^ bsc.%−−] : I m ean , t hat are less
fe016 [ fh|s.%−−] : well [ disfm arker] I don’t [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fh|qy^ rt ] : uh , t hat have som e m ore em ot ional aspect s t o t hem
,
fe016 [ qrr.%−] : or st rong [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : We had som e good ones earlier .
fe016 [ s] : There ’s laught er ,
fe016 [ s] : um I ’m t alking m ore about st rong differences of opinion
m eet ings ,
fe016 [ s.%−−] : m aybe wit h m anager t ypes , or [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ba] : I t hink it ’s hard t o record t hose .
fe016 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : To be allowed t o record t hem ?
m e013 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : Yeah , people will get [ disfm arker]

fe016 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : It ’s also likely t hat people will cancel out aft erwards .
fe008 [ s^ t ] : But I [ disfm arker] but I want ed t o raise t he KPFA idea .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s] : Well , if t here is , anyway .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah , I was gonna m ent ion t hat .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Oh , t hat ’s a good idea .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : That ’s [ disfm arker] That would be a good m at ch .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah . So [ disfm arker] Yeah . So I [ disfm arker] I
[ disfm arker] uh , I [ disfm arker] I ’d m ent ioned t o Adam , and
[ disfm arker] t hat was anot her t hing I was gonna t alk [ disfm arker] uh ,
m ent ion t o t hem before [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] t hat uh t here ’s uh
[ disfm arker] It [ disfm arker] it oc it occurred t o m e t hat we m ight be
able t o get som e addit ional dat a by t alking t o uh acquaint ances in
local broadcast m edia .
m e013 [ s] : Because , you know , we had t alked before about t he
problem about using found dat a , [ com m ent ] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat uh
it ’s just set up however t hey have it set up
m e013 [ s] : and we don’t have any say about it
m e013 [ s] : and it ’s t ypically one m icrophone ,
m e013 [ s] : in a , uh , uh [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker]
and so it doesn’t really give us t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he uh
charact erist ics we want .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um and so I do t hink we ’re gonna cont inue recording
here and record what we can .
m e013 [ fh|s] : But um , it did occur t o m e t hat we could go t o friends in
broadcast m edia and say " hey y ou have t his panel show , [ pause] or
t his [ disfm arker] y ou know , t his discussion show , and um can you
record m ult i − channel ? "
m e013 [ fh|s.%−] : And uh t hey m ay be willing t o record it uh wit h
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ qy ^ 2^ d^ rt ] : Wit h lapel m ikes or som et hing ?
m e013 [ s^ ng] : Well , t hey probably already use lapel ,
m e013 [ s] : but t hey m ight be able t o have it [ disfm arker] it wouldn’t
be t hat weird for t hem t o have anot her m ike t hat was som ewhat
dist ant .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : It wouldn’t be exact ly t his set up , but it would be t hat sort
of t hing ,
m e013 [ s] : and what we were gonna get from UW , you know ,
assum ing t hey [ disfm arker] t hey [ disfm arker] t hey st art recording ,
isn’t [ disfm arker] als also is not going t o be t his exact set up .
fe016 [ s^ ba^ rt ] : Right . No , I t hink t hat ’d be great ,
m e013 [ s] : So , [ com m ent ] I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I
was t hinking of looking int o t hat .
fe016 [ s^ e] : if we can get m ore dat a .

m e013 [ s] : t he ot her t hing t hat occurred t o m e aft er we had t hat
discussion , in fact , is t hat it ’s even possible , since of course , m any
radio shows are not live , [ com m ent ] uh t hat we could invit e t hem t o
have like som e of t heir [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] record som e of t heir
shows here .
fe008 [ s^ ba^ fe] : Wow !
fe016 [ fg|s.%−−] : Well [ disfm arker] Or [ disfm arker] The t hing is , t hey ’re
not as av erse t o wearing one of t hese head − m ount
m e011 [ s] : Right , as we are .
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , t hey ’re on t he radio ,
fe016 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe016 [ fh|s^ ba] : So . [ com m ent ] Um , I t hink t hat ’d be fant ast ic
m e013 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : cuz t hose kinds of panels and [ disfm arker] Those have
int erest ing
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : Th − t hat ’s an [ disfm arker] a side of st yle [ disfm arker] a
st y le t hat we ’re not collect ing here ,
fe016 [ fh] : so
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And [ disfm arker] and t he [ disfm arker] I m ean , t he
ot her side t o it was t he [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker] which is where
we were com ing from [ disfm arker] I ’ll [ disfm arker] I ’ll t alk t o you m ore
about it lat er [ com m ent ] is t hat [ disfm arker] is t hat t here ’s
[ disfm arker] t here ’s uh
fe016 [ s^ ba] : it ’d be great .
m e013 [ s] : t he radio st at ions and t elevision st at ions already have
st uff worked out presum ably , uh relat ed t o , you know , legal issues
and [ disfm arker] and perm issions and all t hat .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , t hey already do what t hey do [ disfm arker] do
what ev er t hey do .
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] uh , it ’s [ disfm arker] So it ’s
[ disfm arker] so it ’s anot her source .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : So I t hink it ’s som et hing we should look int o ,
m e013 [ s] : y ou know , we ’ll collect what we collect here
m e013 [ s] : hopefully t hey will collect m ore at UW also
m e013 [ fh|s] : and um [ disfm arker] and m aybe we have t his ot her
source .
m e013 [ s] : But yeah I t hink t hat it ’s not unreasonable t o aim at
get t ing , y ou know , significant ly in excess of a hundred hours .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , t hat was sort of our goal .
m e013 [ s] : The t hing was , I was hoping t hat we could [ disfm arker] @
@ in t he [ disfm arker] under t his cont rolled sit uat ion we could at least
collect , y ou know , t hirt y t o fift y hours .
m e013 [ s] : And at t he rat e we ’re going we ’ll get pret t y close t o t hat I
t hink t his sem est er .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : And if we cont inue t o collect som e next sem est er , I
t hink we should , uh [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fg] : Right .
fe016 [ s] : Yeah I was m ost ly t rying t o t hink , " OK , if you st art a project
, wit hin say a m ont h , you know , how m uch dat a do you have t o work
wit h .
fe016 [ s] : And you [ disfm arker] y ou wanna s you wanna sort of fr
freeze y our [ disfm arker] your dat a for awhile
fe016 [ fh|s.%−−] : so um right now [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : and we don’t have t he t ranscript s back yet from IBM
fe016 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ s^ nd.%−] : Well , we don’t even have it for t his f you know ,
fort y − five m inut es , t hat was [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ qy .%−−] : Do [ disfm arker] Oh , do we now ?
fe016 [ fh|s^ df^ t ] : So um , not com plaining , I was just t rying t o t hink ,
y ou know , what kinds of project s can y ou do now versus uh six m ont hs
from now
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−] : and t hey ’re pret t y different , because
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah . So I was t hinking right now it ’s sort of t his
ex plorat ory st uff where you [ disfm arker] you look at t he dat a , you use
som e prim it ive m easures and get a feeling for what t he scat t er plot s
look like ,
fe016 [ fg] : um [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fg] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and uh [ disfm arker] and
m eanwhile we collect , and it ’s m ore like yeah , t hree m ont hs from now
, or six m ont hs from now you can [ disfm arker] you can do a lot of ot her
t hings .
fe016 [ b] : Right , right .
fe016 [ s^ no.%−−] : Cuz I ’m not act ually sure , just logist ically t hat I can
spend [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : y ou know , I don’t wanna charge t he t im e t hat I have on t he
project t oo early , before t here ’s enough dat a t o m ake good use of
t he t im e .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : And t hat ’s [ disfm arker] and especially wit h t he st udent
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s] : uh for inst ance t his guy who seem s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ fh] : Uh
fe016 [ s] : any way , I shouldn’t say t oo m uch ,
fe016 [ fh|qy] : but um if som eone cam e t hat was great and want ed t o
do som e real work and t hey hav e t o end by t he end of t his school year
in t he spring , how m uch dat a will I have t o work wit h , wit h t hat person
.

fe016 [ %−] : And so it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : i Yeah , so I would t hink , explorat ory t hings now . Uh ,
t hree m ont hs from now [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , I m ean t he t ranscript ions I t hink are a bit of an
unknown cuz we haven’t got t en t hose back yet as far as t he t im ing ,
m e013 [ s] : but I t hink as far as t he collect ion , it doesn’t seem t o m e l
like , uh , unreasonable t o say t hat uh in January , you know , ro
roughly uh [ disfm arker] which is roughly t hree m ont hs from now , we
should hav e at least som et hing like , you know , t went y − five , t hirt y
hours .
fe016 [ s] : And we just don’t know about t he t ranscript ion part of t hat ,
m e013 [ %−] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : Yeah , we need t o [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat t here ’s a
possibilit y t hat t he t ranscript will need t o be adjust ed aft erwards ,
fe016 [ fh] : so .
fe016 [ %−] : I m ean , it [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ e] : and uh es especially since t hese people won’t be uh
used t o dealing wit h m ult i − channel uh t ranscript ions .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : So I t hink t hat we ’ll need t o adjust som e [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : And also if we wanna add t hings like um , well , m ore refined
coding of overlaps , t hen definit ely I t hink we should count on having
an ext ra pass t hrough .
fe008 [ s] : I want ed t o ask anot her a a aspect of t he dat a collect ion .
fe008 [ s] : There ’d be no reason why a person couldn’t get t oget her
sev eral uh , y ou know , friends ,
fe008 [ s] : and com e and argue about a t opic if t hey want ed t o ,
fe008 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ s^ na.%−−] : If t hey really have som et hing t hey wanna t alk
about as opposed t o som et hing @ @ [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , what we ’re t rying t o st ay away from was art ificial
const ruct ions ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but I t hink if it ’s a real [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qh^ aa] : Why not ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , I ’m t hinking , polit ically [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : St age som e polit ical debat es .
fe008 [ s] : You could do t his ,
fe016 [ h|s^ aa] : Well yeah ,
fe008 [ s] : y ou know . You could .
fe016 [ s] : or just if you ’re [ disfm arker] if you ha If t here are m eet ings
here t hat happen t hat we can record even if we don’t [ pause] um have
t hem do t he digit s , [ com m ent ] or m aybe have t hem do a short er
[ pause] digit t hing [ com m ent ] like if it was , you know , uh , one st ring
of digit s , or som et hing , t hey ’d probably be willing t o do .

m e011 [ s] : We don’t have t o do t he digit s at all if we don’t want t o .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : Then , having t he dat a is v ery valuable ,
fe016 [ s^ df] : cuz I t hink it ’s um polit ically bet t er for us t o say we have
t his m any hours of audio dat a , especially wit h t he ITR , if we put in a
proposal on it .
fe016 [ s] : It ’ll just look like ICSI ’s collect ed a lot m ore audio dat a .
fe016 [ fh|s] : Um , whet her it ’s t ranscribed or not um , is anot her
issue ,
fe016 [ s] : but t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here are research quest ions you
can answer wit hout t he t ranscript ions , or at least t hat you can st art
t o answer .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : It seem s like you could hold som e m eet ings .
fe016 [ fh] : So .
fe008 [ s] : You know , you and m aybe Adam ?
fe008 [ s^ cs] : You [ disfm arker] you could [ disfm arker] you could
m ay be hold som e addit ional m eet ings , if you want ed .
m e018 [ qw^ rt .%−−] : Would it help at all [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : I m ean , we ’re already t alking about sort of t wo levels of
det ail in m eet ings .
m e018 [ s] : One is uh um wit hout doing t he digit s [ disfm arker] Or , I
guess t he full − blown one is where you do t he digit s , and everyt hing ,
and t hen t alk about doing it wit hout digit s ,
m e018 [ qw] : what if we had anot her level , just t o collect dat a , which
is wit hout t he headset s and we just did t he t able − m ount ed st uff .
fe016 [ s^ ng] : Need t he close − t alking m ikes .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : You do , OK .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : I m ean , absolut ely ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah . Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−] : y eah . I ’m really scared [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : It seem s like it ’s a big part of t his corpus is t o have t he
close − t alking m ikes .
fe016 [ fh|s] : Um or at least , like , m e personally ? I would [ disfm arker]
[ com m ent ] I [ disfm arker] couldn’t use t hat dat a .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see , OK .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ na] : I agree .
fe016 [ fg] : Um .
fe008 [ s] : And Mari also ,
fe008 [ s] : we had [ disfm arker] This cam e up when she she was here .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s im port ant .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah ,
fe016 [ s^ bd] : So it ’s a great idea ,
m e013 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] b By t he [ disfm arker] by t he
way , I don’t t hink t he t ranscript ions are act ually , in t he long run ,
such a big bot t leneck .

fe016 [ s] : and if it were t rue t han I would just do t hat ,
fe016 [ s^ ba] : but it ’s not t hat bad [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : like t he room is not t he bot t leneck ,
fe016 [ s] : and we have enough t im e in t he room ,
fe016 [ s] : it ’s get t ing t he people t o com e in and put on t he
[ disfm arker] and get t he set up going .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink t he issue is just t hat we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re
blazing t hat pat h .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ fh|qy ^ rt ] : And [ disfm arker] and um [ disfm arker] d Do you have
any idea when [ disfm arker] when uh t he [ disfm arker] you ’ll be able t o
send uh t he t en hours t o t hem ?
m e011 [ h|s] : Well , I ’ve been burning t wo C Ds a day , which is about
all I can do wit h t he t im e I have .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ cc] : So it ’ll be early next week .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , OK .
m e013 [ s] : So early next week we send it t o t hem ,
m e013 [ s] : and t hen [ disfm arker] t hen we check wit h t hem t o see if
t hey ’v e got it
m e013 [ s] : and we [ disfm arker] we st art , you know asking about t he
t im ing for it .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ fh|s] : So I t hink once t hey get it sort ed out about how t hey ’re
gonna do it , which I t hink t hey ’re pret t y well along on , cuz t hey were
able t o read t he files and so on .
m e011 [ b.%] : Yep .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e011 [ s^ aap.%−−] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg] : Well [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy^ bh] : Yeah , who knows where t hey are .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Hav e t hey ever responded t o you ?
m e011 [ s^ ar] : Nope .
m e013 [ s^ df] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker] You know , so t hey [ disfm arker]
t hey [ disfm arker] t hey have [ disfm arker] you know , t hey ’re
v olunt eering t heir t im e and t hey have a lot of ot her t hings t o do ,
fe016 [ %−] : What if [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , you [ disfm arker] we can’t com plain .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ s] : But t hey [ disfm arker] But at any rat e , t hey ’ll [ disfm arker] I
[ disfm arker] I t hink once t hey get t hat sort ed out , t hey ’re
[ disfm arker] t hey ’re m aking casset t es t here , t hen t hey ’re handing it
t o som eone who t hey [ disfm arker] who ’s [ disfm arker] who is doing it ,

m e013 [ fh|s] : and uh I t hink it ’s not going t o be [ disfm arker] I don’t
t hink it ’s going t o be t hat m uch m ore of a deal for t hem t o do t hirt y
hours t hen t o do one hour ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : I t hink . It ’s not going t o be t hirt y
m e011 [ s^ aa|s] : Yep . I t hink t hat ’s probably t rue .
fe016 [ qy ^ bh] : Really ?
fe016 [ s.%−] : So it ’s t he am ount of [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s just get t ing it going .
m e011 [ s] : It ’s pipeline , pipeline issues .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ qw] : What about t hese lunch m eet ings [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.%−] : Once t he pipeline fills .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : I m ean , I don’t know , if t here ’s any way wit hout t oo
m uch m ore ov erhead , even if we don’t ship it right away t o IBM even if
we just collect it here for awhile , [ com m ent ] t o record you know , t wo
or t hree m ore m eet ing a week ,
fe016 [ s^ df^ rt ] : just t o have t he dat a , even if t hey ’re um not doing
t he digit s , but t hey do wear t he headphones ?
m e013 [ s^ ng.%−] : But t he lunch m eet ings are pret t y m uch one person
get t ing up and [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ ar.%−−] : No , I m eant ,
fe016 [ fh|s] : um , sorry , t he m eet ings where people eat t heir lunch
downst airs ,
fe016 [ s.%−] : m ay be t hey don’t wanna be recorded , but [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Oh , and we ’re just chat t ing ?
fe016 [ s^ aa^ m ] : Just t he ch t he chat t ing .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , we have a lot of t hose .
fe016 [ s] : I act ually [ disfm arker] I act ually t hink t hat ’s [ pause] useful
[ pause] dat a , um [ pause] t he chat t ing ,
m e011 [ s^ am |s] : Yeah , t he problem wit h t hat is I would [ disfm arker] I
t hink I would feel a lit t le const rained t o [ disfm arker] You know ? Uh ,
som e of t he m eet ings [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ %−] : but [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : OK .
fe016 [ s.%−] : You don’t wanna do it , cuz [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : OK .
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ rt :s] : You know , our " soccer ball " m eet ing ?
m e011 [ s] : I guess none of you were t here for our soccer ball m eet ing
.
fe016 [ b] : Alright .
fe016 [ s] : Alright , [ com m ent ] so I ’ll just t hrow it out t here ,
m e011 [ s^ ba] : That was hilarious .
fe016 [ s] : if any one knows of one m ore m or t wo m ore wee m eet ings
per week t hat happen at ICSI , um t hat we could record , I t hink it
would be wort h it .

m e013 [ fg|s^ co] : Yeah . Well , we should also check wit h Mari again ,
because t hey [ disfm arker] because t hey were really int ending , you
know , m aybe just didn’t happen , but t hey were really int ending t o be
duplicat ing t his in som e level .
m e013 [ s] : So t hen t hat would double [ pause] what we had .
m e013 [ s] : Uh . And t here ’s a lot of different m eet ings at UW
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh [ disfm arker] I m ean really m a lot m ore [ com m ent ]
t han we have here right cuz we ’re not right on cam pus ,
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ fh] : so .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t he uh , not ion of recording any of Chuck ’s
m eet ings dead in t he wat er ,
m e018 [ qrr^ rt ] : or is t hat st ill a possibilit y ?
m e013 [ h|s] : Uh , [ v ocalsound] t hey seem t o have som e problem s wit h
it . We can [ disfm arker] we can t alk about t hat lat er .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , but , again , Jerry is [ disfm arker] Jerry ’s open
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So I m ean , we have t wo speech m eet ings , one uh
net work m eet ing ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : uh Jerry was open t o it but I [ disfm arker] I s
m e013 [ s^ cs] : One of t he t hings t hat I t hink is a lit t le [ disfm arker] a
lit t le bit of a lim it at ion , t here is a t hink when t he people are not
inv olv ed uh in our work , we probably can’t do it every week .
m e013 [ s] : You know ? I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I
t hink t hat [ disfm arker] t hat people are gonna feel uh [ disfm arker] are
gonna feel a lit t le bit const rained .
m e013 [ s] : Now , it m ight get a lit t le bet t er if we don’t have t hem do
t he digit s all t he t im e .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t he [ disfm arker] t hen [ disfm arker] so t hen t hey
can just really sort of t ry t o [ disfm arker] put t he m ikes on and t hen just
charge in and [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ qw] : What if we give people [ disfm arker] you know , we cat er a
lunch in exchange for t hem having t heir m eet ing here or som et hing ?
fe008 [ s^ ng] : Well , you know , I [ disfm arker] I do t hink eat ing while
y ou ’re doing a m eet ing is going t o be increasing t he noise .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Alright , alright , alright .
fe008 [ s^ df] : But I had anot her quest ion , which is um , you know , in
principle , w um , I know t hat y ou don’t want art ificial t opics ,
fe008 [ s^ cs] : but um it does seem t o m e t hat we m ight be able t o get
subject s from cam pus t o com e down and do som et hing t hat wouldn’t
be t oo art ificial .
fe008 [ s^ e] : I m ean , we could [ disfm arker] polit ical discussions , or
[ disfm arker] or som et hing or ot her ,
fe016 [ s^ na] : No , definit ely .

fe008 [ fh] : and
fe008 [ s.%−−] : i you know , people who are [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Because , you know , t here ’s also t his const raint . We d
fe008 [ s] : it ’s like , you know , t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] uh
goldibears [ disfm arker] goldi goldilocks ,
fe008 [ s] : it ’s like y ou don’t want m eet ings t hat are t oo large , but
y ou don’t want m eet ings t hat are t oo sm all .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : And um [ disfm arker] a and it just seem s like m aybe we
could ex ploit t he subj hum an subject p p pool , in t he posit ive sense of

m e018 [ s.%−−] : Well , even [ disfm arker] I m ean , com ing down from

fe008 [ s^ cs] : We could pay subject s .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : or what about people in t he [ disfm arker] in t he

fe016 [ s.%−] : Yeah , I was t hinking , t here ’s all t hese ot her peo
m e018 [ s.%−] : I m ean , t here ’s t he St at e of California downst airs , and
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
