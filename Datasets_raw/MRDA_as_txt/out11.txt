m n015 [ s^ t ^ t c] : t hat ’s t hat bit of news ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : and t he ot her bit of news is we had [ disfm arker]
y ou know , uh , I was visit ed by m y Germ an project m anager
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : who A , did like what we did [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ e^ rt ] : what we ’re doing here ,
m n015 [ s] : and B , is planning t o com e here eit her t hree weeks in July

m e003 [ qw^ bu^ d.%−] : On [ disfm arker] ?
m n015 [ s] : Wit h us .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n015 [ s] : And we sat around and we t alked
m n015 [ s] : and he cam e up [ disfm arker] we cam e up [ disfm arker] wit h
a pret t y st range idea .
m n015 [ s^ t ] : And t hat ’s what I ’m gonna lay on you now .
m n015 [ fh|s] : And um , m aybe it m ight be ult im at ely t he m ost
int erest ing t hing for Eva
m n015 [ s] : because she has been known t o com plain about t he fact
t hat t he st uff we do here is not weird enough .
fn050 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : So t his is so weird it should ev en m ake you happy .
fn050 [ s^ bk] : Uh . [ com m ent ] OK .
m e045 [ s^ ba] : Oh great .
m n015 [ s] : Im agine if you will , [ vocalsound] t hat we have a syst em
t hat does all t hat underst anding t hat we want it t o do based on
ut t erances .
m e003 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : It should be possible t o m ake t hat syst em produce
quest ions .
m n015 [ s:qw] : So if y ou have t he knowledge of how t o int erpret "
where is X ? " under given condit ions , sit uat ional , user , discourse
and ont ological [ v ocalsound] condit ions , you should also be able t o
m ake t hat sam e syst em ask " where is X ? "
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ e] : in a sper cert ain way ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : based on cert ain int ent ions .
m n015 [ s] : So in inst ead of just being able t o observe phenom enon ,
um , and , guess t he int ent ion we m ight be able just t o sort of give it
an int ent ion , and m ake it produce an ut t erance .
m e045 [ b] : Hm m .

m e003 [ s] : Well , like in AI t hey generally do t he t ake in ,
m e003 [ s] : and t hen t hey also do t he generat ion phase , like Nancy ’s
t hing .
m e003 [ fh] : Or uh ,
m e003 [ s] : you rem em ber , in t he [ disfm arker] t he hand t hing in one −
eight y − t wo , like not only was it able t o recognize but it was also t o
generat e based upon sit uat ions .
m e003 [ qy ^ rt ] : You m ean t hat sort of t hing ?
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Absolut ely .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : And once you ’ve done t hat what we can do is have t he
sy st em ask it self .
m n015 [ s] : And answer ,
m n015 [ s] : underst and t he answer ,
m n015 [ s] : ask som et hing else ,
m n015 [ s] : and ent er a dialogue wit h it self .
m n015 [ s] : So t he [ disfm arker] t he ba basic [ disfm arker] t he sam e
idea as having t wo chess com put ers play against each ot her .
m e045 [ s^ j] : Ex cept t his sm acks a lit t le bit m ore of a schizophrenic
com put er t han AI .
m n015 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah you c if you want , you can have t wo parallel
[ v ocalsound] m achines um , asking each ot her .
m n015 [ qh] : What would t hat give us ?
m n015 [ s] : Would A be som et hing com plet ely weird and st range ,
m n015 [ s] : and B , i if you look at all t he fact ors , we will never observe
people let ’s say , in wheelchairs under [ disfm arker] you know , in
[ disfm arker] under all condit ions ,
m e045 [ s^ ba] : That ’s good .
m n015 [ s] : you know , when t hey say " X " , and t here is a ride at t he
goal , and t he parking is good , we can never collect enough dat a .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ e] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not possible .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Right , right .
m n015 [ s] : But m aybe one could do som e learning .
m n015 [ s] : If you get t he syst em t o speak t o it self , you m ay find n
break downs and errors and you m ay be able t o learn .
m n015 [ s] : And m ake it m ore robust ,
m n015 [ s] : m ay be learn new t hings .
m n015 [ fh] : And um ,
m n015 [ s] : so t here ’s no [ disfm arker] no end of pot ent ial t hings one
could get out of it , if t hat works .
m n015 [ s] : And he would like t o act ually work on t hat wit h us .
m n015 [ fh] : So
m e003 [ s] : Well t hen , he probably should be com ing back a year
[ pause] from now .
m n015 [ s^ aap|s.%−−] : Yeah , I w

m n015 [ s^ ba^ df] : See t he [ disfm arker] t he generat ion bit , m aking
t he sy st em generat e [ disfm arker] generat e som et hing , [ com m ent ] is
[ disfm arker] shouldn’t be t oo hard .
m e003 [ s^ aap] : Well , once t he sy st em underst ands t hings .
m e045 [ s^ aa|s^ ba^ j] : Yeah . No problem .
m e003 [ s] : I just don’t t hink [ disfm arker] I t hink we ’re probably a year
away from get t ing t he syst em t o underst and t hings .
m n015 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah . Well , if we can get it t o underst and one t hing
, like our " where is " run t hrough we can also , m aybe , e m ake it say ,
or ask " where is X ? " Or not .
m e045 [ s^ nd^ no] : Mm m , I don’t know .
m e045 [ s^ nd] : e I ’m sort of [ disfm arker] have t he im pression t hat
get t ing it t o say t he right t hing in t he right circum st ances is m uch
m ore difficult t han get t ing it t o underst and som et hing given t he
circum st ances and so on ,
m e045 [ s^ df^ e|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : y ou know , I m ean just cuz it ’s sort of
harder t o learn t o speak correct ly in a foreign language , rat her t han
learning t o underst and it . Right ?
m e045 [ %−−] : I m ean
m n015 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e045 [ s|qy^ d^ f^ g] : just t he fact t hat we ’ll get [ disfm arker] The
point is t hat get t ing it t o underst and one const ruct ion doesn’t m ean
t hat it will n always know exact ly when it ’s correct t o use t hat
const ruct ion . Right ?
m n015 [ %−−] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : Well , I ’v e [ disfm arker] I ’v e done generat ion and language
product ion research for fo four [ disfm arker] four and a half years .
m n015 [ s] : And so it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] you ’re right ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : it ’s not t he sam e as t he underst anding .
m n015 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : It ’s in som e ways easier and som e ways harder
. nuh ?
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ fh] : But , um ,
m n015 [ s] : I t hink it ’d be fun t o look at it , or int o t hat quest ion .
m e045 [ b] : Nnn , y eah .
m n015 [ s^ ba] : It ’s a pret t y st range idea .
m n015 [ s.%−] : And so t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s [ disfm arker] But
[ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : The basic idea I guess would be t o give
[ disfm arker] allow t he syst em t o hav e int ent ions , basically ?
m e003 [ s^ df] : Cuz t hat ’s basically what needs t o be added t o t he
sy st em for it .
m n015 [ s.%−] : Well , look at t h
m n015 [ s.%−−] : eee , I t hink even [ disfm arker] t hink even [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : What it [ disfm arker] would be t he [ disfm arker] t he prior
int ent ion .

m n015 [ s.%−] : So let ’s uh [ disfm arker] uh , let ’s say we have t his
[ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : Well we ’d have t o seed t hat ,
m e003 [ %−−] : I m ean .
m n015 [ s] : No . Let ’s [ disfm arker] we hav e t o [ disfm arker] we have
som e [ disfm arker] som e t op − down processing , given cert ain set t ing .
m n015 [ s:s] : OK , now we change not hing , and just say ask
som et hing .
m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e003 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n015 [ qw] : What would it ask ?
m e003 [ s] : It wouldn’t know what t o ask .
m e003 [ %−−] : I m ean .
m n015 [ s.%−] : It shur
m e003 [ s] : Unless it was in a sit uat ion .
m e003 [ s] : We ’d have t o set up a sit uat ion where , it didn’t know
where som et hing was and it want ed t o go t here .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah !
fn050 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Which m eans t hat we ’d need t o set up an
int ent ion inside of t he syst em . Right ?
m n015 [ %−] : Eh , n
m e003 [ s^ e:s] : Which is basically , " I don’t know where som et hing is
and I need t o go t here " .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ qy ] : Ooh , do we really need t o do t hat ?
m n015 [ s^ df.%−] : Because ,
m e003 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : Well , no I guess not .
m e003 [ %−−] : Ex cel
m n015 [ %−−] : s
m n015 [ s^ ba] : It ’s [ disfm arker] i I know it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s st range ,
m n015 [ s] : but look at it [ disfm arker] look at our Bayes − net .
m n015 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : If we don’t hav e [ disfm arker] Let ’s assum e
we don’t have any input from t he language . Right ?
m n015 [ s] : So t here ’s also not hing we could query t he ont ology ,
m n015 [ s] : but we have a cert ain user set t ing .
m n015 [ s] : If you just ask , what is t he likelihood of t hat person
want ing t o ent er som e [ disfm arker] som et hing , it ’ll give you an
answer .
m n015 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m n015 [ s] : That ’s just how t hey are .
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m n015 [ s] : And so , @ @ what ev er t hat is , it ’s t he generic default
int ent ion . That it would find out .
m n015 [ s] : Which is , want ing t o know where som et hing is ,

m n015 [ s.%−−] : m aybe nnn [ disfm arker] and want ing [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : I don’t know what it ’s gonna be ,
m n015 [ s.%−] : but t here ’s gonna be som et hing t hat
m e045 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : Well you ’re not gonna [ disfm arker] are you gonna
get a v ariet y of int ent ions out of t hat t hen ?
m e045 [ s^ bu] : I m ean , you ’re just t alking about like given t his user ,
what ’s t he t h what is it [ disfm arker] what is t hat user m ost likely t o
want t o do ?
m e045 [ s.%−] : And , have it t alk about [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s:qw] : Well you can observe som e user and cont ext st uff and
ask , what ’s t he post erior probabilit ies of all of our decision nodes .
m e045 [ %] : OK .
m n015 [ s:s] : You could even say , " let ’s t ake all t he priors ,
m n015 [ s:s] : let ’s observe not hing " , and query all t he post erior
probabilit ies .
m n015 [ s] : It − it ’s gonna t ell us som et hing .
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m n015 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ aap|s^ aa] : Well , it will d r assign values t o all t he nodes .
Yes .
m n015 [ s^ aa|s] : Yes . And com e up wit h post erior probabilit ies for all
t he v alues of t he decision nodes .
m n015 [ s] : Which , if we have an algorit hm t hat filt ers out what ever
t he [ disfm arker] t he best or t he m ost consist ent answer out of t hat ,
will giv e us t he int ent ion ex nihilo .
m n015 [ s] : And t hat is exact ly what would happen if we ask it t o
produce an ut t erance ,
m n015 [ s] : it would be b based on t hat ext ension , ex nihilo ,
m n015 [ s] : which we don’t know what it is ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : but it ’s t here .
m n015 [ s] : So we wouldn’t even hav e t o [ disfm arker] t t o kick st art it
by giving it a cert ain int ent ion or observing anyt hing on t he decision
node .
m n015 [ s:qw] : And what ever t hat [ disfm arker] m aybe t hat would lead
t o " what is t he cast le ? " ,
m e003 [ %−] : I ’m just [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s:qw] : or " what is t hat what ever " .
m e003 [ s] : I guess what I ’m afraid of is if we don’t , you know , set up
a [ pause] sit uat ion , [ com m ent ] we ’ll just get a bunch of garbage out ,
m e003 [ s] : like y ou know , everyt hing ’s exact ly t hirt y percent .
m n015 [ s^ ar] : No [ disfm arker]
fn050 [ %] : Mm m .
m n015 [ fg|s] : Yeah . So what we act ually t hen need t o do is
[ disfm arker] is writ e a lit t le script t hat changes all t he set t ings ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : you know , go goes t hrough all t he perm ut at ions ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : which is [ disfm arker] we did a [ disfm arker]

m n015 [ qy ] : didn’t we calculat e t hat once ?
m e003 [ s^ na] : Well t hat was [ disfm arker] t hat was absurdly low , in
t he last m eet ing ,
m n015 [ s.%−] : It ’s a [ disfm arker]
fn050 [ %−] : Uh ,
m e003 [ s] : cuz I went and looked at it
m e003 [ s:s] : cuz I was t hinking , t hat could not be right ,
m e003 [ s.%−] : and it would [ disfm arker] it was on t he order of t went y
out put nodes and som et hing like t went y [ disfm arker]
fn050 [ s^ 2] : And like t hirt y input nodes
m e003 [ s^ bk^ m ] : t hirt y input nodes .
fn050 [ %−] : or som e [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s.%−−] : So t o t est every out put node , uh , would at least
[ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ rt ] : Let ’s see , so it would be t wo t o t he t hirt y for every

m e003 [ s] : Which is very t h very large .
m n015 [ s^ bk|%−] : Oh ! That ’s n
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n015 [ s] : t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s not hing for t hose neural guys .
m n015 [ s] : I m ean , t hey t rain for m illions and m illions of epochs .
m n015 [ fh] : So .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : Well , I ’m t alking about
m e003 [ s] : Oh , I was gonna t ake a drink of m y wat er .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : I ’m t alking about billions and billions and billions and
m e003 [ s.%−−] : a num ber [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s.%−−] : t wo t o t he t hirt y is like a

m e003 [ s.%−−] : And if i

m e045 [ s] : Th − t hat ’s big .
m e045 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : That ’s just [ disfm arker] That ’s uh
[ disfm arker] It ’s a billion , right ?
m e003 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Two t o t he t hirt y ?
m e003 [ s] : Well , t wo t o t he t hirt y is a billion ,

m e045 [ s^ bk] : Right .

m e045 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e045 [ fg|s^ ba] : Yeah . Yeah , t hat ’s big .
m e003 [ s] : Cuz y ou have t o query t he node , for every a uh , or query

fn050 [ s^ no] : I don’t really know .
m e045 [ fg|s] : Yeah , it ’s g Anyway , t he point is t hat given all of t hese

m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n015 [ h|s^ aap] : Um , well it ’s m ore [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ e|qy^ d^ f^ g] : It ’s bot h , right ?

m n015 [ s] : but all for t he sake of doing com put er science .
m n015 [ s] : So it ’s sort of cognit ive , psy cho , neural , plausibly

m n015 [ s.%−] : And i
m e003 [ s] : Well , I really can’t keep a st raight face doing anyt hing .

fe004 [ qy ^ e^ rt ] : Did you just say grat eful for us ?
fe004 [ s^ fa] : OK , sorry .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : Anyway .
m n015 [ s] : Think of [ disfm arker] back at t he EVA vect or ,
m n015 [ s:qw] : and Johno com ing up wit h t he idea t hat if t he person
discussed t he [ disfm arker] discussed t he adm ission fee , in
[ disfm arker] eh previously , t hat m ight be a good indicat ion t hat , "
how do I get t o t he cast le ? " , act ually he want s t o ent er .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s:qw] : Or , you know , " how do I get t o X ? "
m n015 [ s] : discussing t he adm ission fee in t he previous ut t erance , is
a good indicat ion .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n015 [ fh] : So
m n015 [ s] : we don’t want a hard code , a set of lexem es , or t hings ,
t hat person ’s you know , sort of filt er , or uh search t he discourse
hist ory .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : So what would be kind of cool is t hat if we encount er
concept s t hat are cast le , t ower , bank , hot el , we run it t hrough t he
ont ology ,
m n015 [ s] : and t he ont ology t ells us it has um , adm ission , opening
t im es ,
m n015 [ s] : it has adm ission fees ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : it has t his , it has t hat ,

m n015 [ s^ rt ] : and t hen we [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] we m ake a
t hesaurus lex icon , look up ,
m n015 [ s] : and t hen search dynam ically t hrough t he uh , discourse
hist ory for [ pause] occurrences of t hese t hings in a given window of
ut t erances .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : And t hat m ight , you know , give us addit ional input t o
belief A v ersus B .
m n015 [ s^ e] : Or E versus A .
fe004 [ s^ bu.%−−] : So it ’s not just a part icular word ’s [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ fh|s] : OK , so t he [ disfm arker] you ’re looking for a few keys
t hat y ou know are cues t o [ disfm arker] sorry , a few specific cues t o
som e int ent ion .
m e003 [ s|s^ aa] : You can dynam ically look up keys , yeah .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s^ df] : Uh , so , wait [ disfm arker] so um , since t his
[ disfm arker] since t his sort of t echnical st uff is going over m y head ,
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e003 [ s^ e] : And t hen grep , basically .
m e045 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : t he [ disfm arker] t he point is t hat you uh
[ disfm arker] t hat when som eone ’s t alking about a cast le , you know
t hat it ’s t he sort of t hing t hat people are likely t o wanna go int o ?
m e045 [ qrr] : Or , is it t he fact t hat if t here ’s an adm ission fee , t hen
one of t he t hings we know about adm ission fees is t hat you pay t hem
in order t o go in ?
m e045 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : And t hen t he idea of ent ering is act ive in t he
discourse or som et hing ? And t hen
m n015 [ %−] : Well
m e045 [ s^ e] : blah − blah − blah ?
m e045 [ fh] : I m ean .
m n015 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] t he idea is ev en m ore general .
m n015 [ s] : The idea is t o say , we encount er a cert ain ent it y in a
[ disfm arker] in a in a ut t erance .
m n015 [ s] : So le let ’s look up everyt hing we [ disfm arker] t he ont ology
giv es us about t hat ent it y ,
m n015 [ s] : what st uff it does , what roles it has ,
m n015 [ s] : what part s , what ever it has .
m n015 [ s^ e] : Funct ions .
m n015 [ s] : And , t hen we look in t he discourse , whet her any of t hat ,
or any surface st ruct ure corresponding t o t hese roles , funct ions aaa
[ com m ent ] has ever occurred .
m e045 [ b] : Oh , OK .
m n015 [ s:s] : And t hen , t he discourse hist ory can t t ell us , " yeah " ,
or " no " .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : And t hen it ’s up for us t o decide what t o do wit h it .

m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ %−] : t So i
m e045 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ co] : No , go ahead .
m n015 [ s:qw] : So , we m ay t hink t hat if you say um , [ vocalsound]
[ v ocalsound] " where is t he t heat er " , um , whet her or not he has
t alked about t icket s before , t hen we [ disfm arker] he ’s probably
wanna go t here t o see som et hing .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ s:qw] : Or " where is t he opera in Par − Paris ? ,
m n015 [ s^ f] : yeah ?
m n015 [ s] : Lot s of people go t o t he opera t o t ake pict ures of it and t o
look at it ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m . OK .
m n015 [ s] : and lot s of people go t o at t end a perform ance .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : And , t he discourse can m aybe t ell us w what ’s m ore likely
if we know what t o look for in previous st at em ent s .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : And so we can hard code " for opera , look for t icket s ,
look for t his , look for t hat ,
m e045 [ b] : OK .
m e045 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : or look for Mozart , look for t hi "
m n015 [ s] : but t he sm art er way is t o go v ia t he ont ology
m n015 [ s] : and dynam ically , t hen look up u st uff .
m e045 [ s^ bk|s^ bu:qw] : OK . But you ’re st ill doing look up so t hat
when t he person [ disfm arker] So t he point is t hat when t he person
say s , " where is it ? " t hen you sort of say , let ’s go back and look at
ot her t hings and t hen decide ,
m e045 [ s] : rat her t han t he ot her possibilit y which is t hat [ pause] all
t hrough discourse as t hey t alk about different t hings [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s.%−−] : You know like w
m e045 [ s:qw] : prior t o t he " where is it " quest ion t hey say , you know ,
" how m uch does it cost t o get in , y ou know , t o [ disfm arker] t o see a
m ov ie around here " ,
m e045 [ fh|s:qw] : um , [ vocalsound] " where is t he closest t heat er "
[ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he point is t hat by
m ent ioning adm ission fees , t hat just sort of st ays act ive now .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s] : You know . That becom es part of like , t heir sort of current
ongoing act iv e concept ual st ruct ure .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e045 [ s] : And t hen , um , over in y our Bayes − net or what ever , when
[ disfm arker] when t he person says " where is it " , you ’ve already got ,
y ou know since t hey were t alking about adm ission , and t hat evokes
t he idea of ent ering , um , t hen when t hey go and ask " where is it " ,
t hen you ’re Ent er node is already act ive
m e045 [ s^ df] : because t hat ’s what t he person is t hinking about .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s] : I m ean t hat ’s t he sort of cognit ive linguist ic − y way ,
m e045 [ s^ bd] : and probably not pract ical .
m n015 [ fg|s] : Yeah , e ult im at ely t hat ’s also what we wanna get at .
m n015 [ s] : I t hink t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he correct way .
m n015 [ s] : So , of course we have t o keep m em ory of what was t he
last int ent ion ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : and how does it fit t o t his , and what does it t ell us , in
t erm s of [ disfm arker] of t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] what we ’re
ex am ining .
m e045 [ b] : Mm m , yeah .
m n015 [ s] : And furt herm ore , I m ean we can idealize t hat , you know ,
people don’t change t opics ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ e] : but t hey do .
m n015 [ s] : But , ev en t h for t hat , t here is a st udent of ours who ’s
doing a dialogue act um , recognit ion m odule .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : So , m aybe , we ’re ev en in a posit ion where we can
t ake your approach ,
m n015 [ s.%−:qw.%−] : which is of course m uch bet t er , as t o say how
[ disfm arker] how do t hese pieces [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ b] : Mm m .
m e045 [ s^ 2] : And m uch harder t o r program .
m n015 [ qw^ br^ rt ] : Hm m ?
m e045 [ s^ r] : And m uch harder t o p t o program .
m n015 [ s^ aa|s^ e:qw] : Yeah . How [ disfm arker] how do t hese pieces
fit t oget her ?
m n015 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n015 [ fh] : And um .
m n015 [ s] : But , OK , nevert heless . So t hese are issues
m n015 [ s:qw] : but we [ disfm arker] what we act ually decided last week
, is t o , and t his is , again , for your benefit [ disfm arker] is t o um ,
pret end we have observed and parsed an ut t erance such as " where is
t he Powder − Tower " ,
m n015 [ s] : or " where is t he zoo " ,

m n015 [ s] : and specify um , what [ disfm arker] what we t hink t he
[ disfm arker] t he out put uh , observ e , out [ disfm arker] i input nodes
for our Bayes − net s for t he sub sub − D , for t he discourse bit , should
be .
m n015 [ s] : So t hat [ disfm arker] And I will [ disfm arker] I will t hen
[ com m ent ] [ v ocalsound] com e up wit h t he ont ology side uh , bit s and
pieces ,
m n015 [ s] : so t hat we can say , OK we [ disfm arker] we always just look
at t his ut t erance .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : That ’s t he only ut t erance we can do ,
m n015 [ s] : it ’s hard coded ,
m n015 [ s] : like Srini , sort of hand parsed ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : hand craft ed ,
m n015 [ s] : but t his is what we hope t o be able t o observe in general
from ut t erances , and from ont ologies ,
m n015 [ s] : and t hen we can sort of fiddle wit h t hese t hings t o see
what it act ually produces , in t erm s of out put .
m e045 [ b] : Uh
m n015 [ fg|s] : So we need t o find out what t he " where is X "
const ruct ion will giv e us in t erm s of sem ant ics
m n015 [ s] : and [ v ocalsound] Sim spec t ype t hings .
fe004 [ %−] : Just [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk|qy ^ bu^ d:qw] : OK . Just " where is X " ?
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ e] : Or any variant s of t hat .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ ar^ fe] : No !
m n015 [ s^ co] : Um , look at it t his way ,
m n015 [ %−−] : i
m n015 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n015 [ qw] : What did we decide .
m n015 [ s:qw] : We decided sort of t he [ disfm arker] t he prot ot ypical "
where is X " , where you know , we don’t really know , does he wanna
go t here , or just wanna know where it is .
m e045 [ s.%−] : Well we were
m n015 [ s^ e:qw|s^ f] : So t he difference of " where is t he railway
st at ion " , versus where [ disfm arker] where [ disfm arker] " where is
Greenland " . Nuh ?
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s^ df|s^ fa] : Uh s I was just dancing , sorry .
m n015 [ s] : We ’re not videot aping any of t his .
m n015 [ fh] : So .
m e003 [ s^ bk.%] : Uh [ disfm arker] ah [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ fg|s^ bu.%−−] : So , um , we ’re supposed t o [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g] : I m ean we ’re t alking about sort of anyt hing
t hat has t he sem ant ics of request for locat ion , right ?

m e045 [ %−−] : act ually ?
m e045 [ %−−] : Or ,
m e045 [ s|qy^ d^ g] : I m ean , anyway , t he node in t he uh [ disfm arker]
t he ult im at e , uh , in [ disfm arker] in t he Bayes − net t hing when you ’re
done , t he [ disfm arker] t he node t hat we ’re t alking about um , is one
t hat says " request for locat ion , t rue " , or som et hing like t hat , right ?
m e045 [ s^ bu:qw|qy ^ d^ g] : Um , and [ disfm arker] and exact ly how t hat
get s act iv at ed , you know , like whet her we want t he sent ence " how
do I get t here ? " t o act ivat e t hat node or not , you know , t hat ’s
[ disfm arker] t hat ’s sort of t he issue t hat sort of t he linguist ic − y side
has t o deal wit h , right ?
m n015 [ s^ aa|s.%−] : Yeah , but it [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ %−] : Yea − Nnn
m n015 [ s^ ng] : Well act ually m ore [ disfm arker] m m ore t he ot her way
around .
m n015 [ s] : We want ed som et hing t hat represent s uncert aint y uh we
in t erm s of going t here or just want ing t o know where it is , for exam ple
.
m n015 [ s] : Som e generic inform at ion .
m e045 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : And so t his is prot ot ypically @ @ found in t he " where is
som et hing " quest ion , surface st ruct ure ,
m e045 [ b] : OK .
m e003 [ %−] : We
m n015 [ s] : which can be p you know , should be m aps t o som et hing
t hat act iv at es bot h .
m n015 [ s.%−] : I m ean t he idea is t o [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s.%−] : I don’t [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Alright , OK .
m e003 [ %] : Hhh .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : let ’s have it fit nicely wit h t he paper .
m e003 [ s.%−] : I guess . I don’t [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ nd^ no] : I don’t see unde how we would be able t o
dist inguish bet ween t he t wo int ent ions just from t he g ut t erance ,
t hough .
m n015 [ %−] : The [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ e] : I m ean , uh bef or , before we don’t [ disfm arker] before
we cranked it t hrough t he Bayes − net .
m e003 [ fh] : I m ean .
m n015 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , we [ disfm arker] we wouldn’t .
m n015 [ s] : That ’s exact ly what we want .
m n015 [ s.%−] : We want t o get [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : We would ?
m n015 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : No . We wouldn’t .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK ,

m e003 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g] : but t hen so basically it ’s just a [ disfm arker]
for every const ruct ion we have a node in t he net , right ?
m e003 [ s] : And we t urn on t hat node .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s] : Oy .
m n015 [ qw.%−−] : What [ disfm arker] what is t his gonna [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Exact ly .
m n015 [ qw.%−−] : What is t he uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ fh] : Well [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : And t hen given t hat we know t hat [ pause] t he
const ruct ion [ pause] has t hese t wo t hings , we can set up
probabilit ies [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : we can s basically define all t he t ables for ev for t hose
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : Yeah , it should be [ disfm arker] So we have
m n015 [ fh] : um ,
m n015 [ s:s] : i let ’s assum e we [ disfm arker] we call som et hing like a
loc − X node and a pat h − X node .
m n015 [ s] : And what we act ually get if we just look at t he discourse , "
where is X " should act ivat e
m n015 [ s.%−−] : or should [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ b] : Mm m .
m n015 [ fh|s] : Hm m . Should be bot h ,
m n015 [ s:qw] : whereas m aybe " where is X locat ed " , we find from t he
dat a , is always just asked when t he person want s t o know where it is ,
m n015 [ s:qw] : and " how do I get t o " is always asked when t he
person just want s t o know how t o get t here .
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m n015 [ s:qw] : So we want t o sort of com e up wit h what get s uh , input
, and how int er in case of a " where is " quest ion .
m n015 [ qh] : So what [ disfm arker] what would t he out com e of
[ disfm arker] of your parser look like ?
m n015 [ qh] : And , what ot her discourse inform at ion from t he
discourse hist ory could we hope t o get , squeeze out of t hat ut t erance
?
m n015 [ s:qw] : So define t he [ disfm arker] t he input int o t he Bayes −
net [ v ocalsound] based on what t he ut t erance , " where is X " , gives
us .
m n015 [ s] : So definit ely have an Ent it y node here which is act ivat ed
v ia t he ont ology ,
fe004 [ %−] : s
m n015 [ s] : so " where is X " produces som et hing t hat is s st ands for X
, whet her it ’s cast le , bank , rest room , t oilet , what ever .
m n015 [ s.%−] : And t hen t he ont ology will t ell us [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ 2^ bu] : That it has a locat ion or som et hing like t hat ?
[ disfm arker]

fe004 [ s^ bu^ e] : or t h t he ont ology will t ell us where act ually it is
locat ed ?
m n015 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : No . Not at all .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : Where it is locat ed , we have , a user proxim it y node here
som ewhere ,
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK . OK .
m n015 [ s^ e] : e which t ells us how far t he user [ disfm arker] how far
away t he user is in respect t o t hat uh ent it y .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s] : So you ’re t alking about , for inst ance , t he const ruct ion
obviously involves t his ent it y or refers [ disfm arker] refers t o t his ent it y ,
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ bu] : and from t he const ruct ion also you know t hat it is a
locat ion [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bsc^ bu] : is [ disfm arker] or a t hing [ disfm arker] t hing t hat
can be locat ed .
fe004 [ s] : Right ? Ont ology says t his t hing has a locat ion slot .
fe004 [ s:qw] : Sh − and t hat ’s t he t hing t hat is being [ disfm arker] t hat
is t he cont ent of t he quest ion t hat ’s being queried by one
int erpret at ion of " where is X " .
fe004 [ s] : And anot her one is , um , pat h from current [ disfm arker]
user current locat ion t o [ com m ent ] t hat locat ion .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ fh] : So .
fe004 [ qy.%−−] : So is t he quest ion [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−−] : I m ean it ’s just t hat I ’m not sure what t he [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qy ] : Is t he quest ion , for t his part icular const ruct ion how we
specify t hat t hat ’s t he inform at ion it provides ?
fe004 [ qrr] : Or [ disfm arker] or asked for ?
fe004 [ s^ e|qy^ d^ g] : b Bot h sides , right ?
m n015 [ s^ ng] : Yeah , you don’t need t o even do t hat .
m n015 [ s] : It ’s just sort of what [ vocalsound] what would be @ @
[ com m ent ] observed in uh [ disfm arker] in t hat case .
fe004 [ qr^ bu] : Observed when you heard t he speaker say " where is X
" , or when [ disfm arker] when t hat ’s been parsed ?
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : So t hese lit t le circles you have by t he D ?
fe004 [ qy .%−] : Is t hat [ disfm arker] ?
m n015 [ s^ na] : That ’s exact ly what we ’re looking for .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK . OK .
m e003 [ s] : I d I just [ disfm arker] I don’t like having [ disfm arker]
charact erizing t he const ruct ions wit h locat ion and pat h ,
m e003 [ s] : or li charact erizing t hem like t hat .
m e003 [ s^ df] : Cuz you don’t [ disfm arker] It seem s like in t he general
case y ou wouldn’t know how [ disfm arker] how t o charact erize t hem .

m n015 [ s^ na] : You wouldn’t .
m e003 [ s:qw] : I m ean [ disfm arker] or , for when .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : There could be an int erpret at ion t hat we don’t have a
node for in t he [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ cs] : I m ean it just seem s like @ @ has t o have uh
[ disfm arker] a node for t he const ruct ion and t hen let t he chips fall
where t hey m ay .
m e003 [ s] : Versus uh , saying , t his const ruct ion eit her can m ean
locat ion or pat h .
m e003 [ s] : And , in t his cas and since [ disfm arker] since it can m ean
eit her of t hose t hings , it would light bot h of t hose up .
m n015 [ s] : It ’s t he sam e .
m e003 [ qo] : Thought s ?
m e003 [ qo] : Quest ions ?
m e045 [ s] : I ’m t hinking about it .
m e045 [ h] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ r] : It will be t he sam e .
m n015 [ s:s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : So I t hink r in here we have " I ’ll go t here " ,
right ?
m e003 [ qo] : Answers ?
m n015 [ s] : And we have our Info − on .
m n015 [ s:s] : So in m y c m y case , t his would sort of m ake t his [ pause]
happy , and t his would m ake t he Go − t here happy .
m n015 [ s:qw] : What you ’re say ing is we have a Where − X quest ion ,
Where − X node , t hat m akes bot h happy .
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m n015 [ s] : That ’s what you ’re proposing , which is , in m y m ind
m n015 [ s^ ba] : just as fine .
m n015 [ s] : So w if we have a const ruct ion [ pause] node , " where is X
" , it ’s gonna bot h get t he po post erior probabilit y t hat [ disfm arker] it
’s Info − on up ,
m e003 [ b] : Mm m , y eah .
m n015 [ s^ e] : Info − on is True − up , and t hat Go − t here is True − up ,
as well .
m n015 [ s] : Which would be exact ly analogous t o what I ’m proposing is
, t his m akes [ disfm arker] uh m akes som et hing here t rue ,
m n015 [ s] : and t his m akes som et hing [ disfm arker] also som et hing
here t rue ,
m n015 [ s] : and t his m akes t his True − up , and t his m akes t his True −

m e045 [ s^ cs] : I kinda like it bet t er wit hout t hat ext ra level of

m e045 [ s] : You know wit h [ disfm arker] wit h t his point s t o t his point s t o
t hat , and so on
m e045 [ s^ df.%−] : because [ vocalsound] I don’t know , it [ disfm arker]

m n015 [ s^ aa|s^ df] : Yeah , because we get [ disfm arker] we get t ons
of const ruct ions I t hink .
fe004 [ %−] : Is − uh ,
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ df] : Because , you know , m m m people have m any ways of
asking for t he sam e t hing ,
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , sure .
fe004 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m n015 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ %−] : So un
m e003 [ s] : I change I changed m y m ind act ually .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ fg|s] : So I agree wit h t hat .
fe004 [ s] : I have a different kinda quest ion ,
fe004 [ s] : m ight be relat ed ,
fe004 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : which is , OK so im plicit ly everyt hing in EDU ,
we ’re alway s inferring t he speaker int ent , right ?
fe004 [ s] : Like , what t hey want
fe004 [ s.%−−] : eit her , t he inform at ion t hat t hey want , or [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bu] : It ’s always inform at ion t hat t hey want probably , of
som e kind .
fe004 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
fe004 [ s^ no] : Or I [ disfm arker] I don’t know ,
m n015 [ s^ nd|s^ ar] : The syst em doesn’t m assage you , no . No .
fe004 [ s^ e.%−] : or what ’s som et hing t hat t hey [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I don’t [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ fh] : So , um ,
fe004 [ s] : let ’s see .
fe004 [ s^ no] : So I don’t know if t he [ disfm arker] I m ean i if t h just
t here ’s m ore s here t hat ’s not shown t hat you [ disfm arker] it ’s
already like part of t he syst em what ever ,
fe004 [ s.%−−:qw.%−−] : but , " where is X " , like , t he fact t hat it is , you
know , a speech − act , what ever ,
fe004 [ s] : it is a quest ion .
fe004 [ s] : It ’s a quest ion t hat , um , queries on som e part icular t hing
X,
fe004 [ s] : and X is t hat locat ion .
fe004 [ s] : There ’s , like , a lot of st ruct ure in represent ing t hat .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yep . Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ bu] : So t hat seem s different from just having t he node "
locat ion − X "
fe004 [ s|qy^ d^ g] : and t hat goes int o EDU , right ?
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . [ vocalsound] Precisely .
m n015 [ %−] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ %−] : So , w

fe004 [ qy ] : So t ha is t hat what you ’re t t alking about ?
m n015 [ s^ aa|s] : Ex act ly . We hav e su we have specified t wo .
fe004 [ s^ e] : wh what kinds of st ruct ure we want .
m n015 [ s] : OK , t he next one would be here , just for m ood .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : The next one would be what we can squeeze out of t he
uh
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : I don’t know , m aybe we wanna observ e t he uh , um ,
[ v ocalsound] [ v ocalsound] uh t he lengt h of [ disfm arker] of t he words
used , and , or t he prosody
fe004 [ b] : Mm m .
m n015 [ s] : and g a and t m ake conclusions about t he user ’s
int elligence .
fe004 [ s^ bk|s.%−] : OK . So in som e ways [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ no] : I don’t know ,
m n015 [ b] : yeah .
fe004 [ fg|s] : um , so in som e ways in t he ot her sort of parallel set of
m o m ore linguist ic m eet ings we ’ve been t alking about possible
sem ant ics of som e const ruct ion .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
fe004 [ %−−] : Where it was
fe004 [ s] : t he sim ulat ion t hat ’s , according t o it [ disfm arker] you know
, t hat [ disfm arker] t hat corresponds t o it , and as well t he [ disfm arker]
as discourse ,
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : what ev er , cont e infor in discourse inform at ion ,
fe004 [ s] : such as t he m ood ,
fe004 [ s] : and , you know , ot her st uff .
fe004 [ qy ^ rt ] : So , are we looking for a sort of abbreviat ion of t hat ,
t hat ’s t ailored t o t his problem ?
fe004 [ s^ df] : Cuz t hat [ disfm arker] t hat has , you know , basically ,
y ou know , s it ’s in progress st ill
fe004 [ s^ df^ e] : it ’s in developm ent st ill ,
fe004 [ s] : but it definit ely has v arious feat ure slot s , at t ribut es , um ,
bindings bet ween t hings [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : U t hat ’s exact ly r um , why I ’m proposing [ disfm arker] It ’s
t oo early t o have [ disfm arker] t o t hink of t hem [ disfm arker] of all of
t hese discourse t hings t hat one could possibly observe ,
fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe004 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s.%−] : so let ’s just assum e
fe004 [ s.%−] : For t he subset of [ disfm arker]

m n015 [ s:qw] : hum an beings are not allowed t o ask anyt hing but "
where is X " .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : This is t he only ut t erance in t he world .
m n015 [ qh] : What could we observ e from t hat ?
fe004 [ s^ bk|s^ bu:qw] : OK . That exact ly " where is X " ,
m n015 [ %−] : In t er
fe004 [ s^ bu^ e] : not t he [ disfm arker] t he choices of " where is X " or "
how do I get t o X " .
fe004 [ s^ bu] : Just " where is X " .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : Just [ disfm arker] just " where is X " .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s:qy|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : And , but you know , do it [ disfm arker] do it
in such a way t hat we know t hat people can also say , " is t he t own hall
in front of t he bank " , so t hat we need som et hing like a w WH focus .
Nuh ?
m n015 [ s.%−] : Should be [ disfm arker] should be t here , t hat , you
know , t his [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] what ev er we get from t he
[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qr] : Wait , so do , or do not t ake ot her kinds of const ruct ions
int o account ?
m n015 [ s] : Well , if you [ disfm arker] if you can , oh definit ely do ,
fe004 [ s^ bk|s] : OK . Where possible .
m n015 [ s^ m ^ na|qy^ d^ f^ g] : where possible . Right ?
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : If i if [ disfm arker] if it ’s not at all t riggered by our t hing ,
t hen it ’s irrelevant ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : and it doesn’t hurt t o leave it out for t he m om ent .
m n015 [ fh] : Um , but [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : Um , it seem s like for inst ance , " where is X " , t he fact
t hat it m ight m ean um , " t ell m e how t o get t o X " ,
fe004 [ fh] : like [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qy .%−−] : Do y So , would you wanna say t hat t hose t wo are bot h
, like [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s|s^ f] : Those are t he t wo int erpret at ions , right ?
fe004 [ s^ e] : t he [ disfm arker] t he ones t hat are locat ion or pat h .
fe004 [ s] : So , y ou could say t hat t he s const ruct ion is a quest ion
asking about t his locat ion ,
fe004 [ s] : and t hen y ou can addit ionally infer , if t hey ’re asking about
t he locat ion , it ’s because t hey wanna go t o t hat place ,
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s:s] : in which case , t he [ disfm arker] you ’re jum ping a st ep
[ disfm arker] st ep and saying , " oh , I know where it is

m e045 [ b.%] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s:s] : but I also know how t o get [ disfm arker] t hey wanna seem
[ disfm arker] t hey seem t o wanna get t here so I ’m gonna t ell t hem " .
fe004 [ s.%−] : So t here ’s like st ruct ure
m e045 [ fg|s] : Right , t h t his [ disfm arker] it ’s not [ disfm arker] it ’s not
t hat t his is sort of like sem ant ically am biguous bet ween t hese t wo .
fe004 [ %−] : i do you kn sort of uh , t hat [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s] : It ’s really about t his
m e045 [ qh] : but why would you care about t his ?
m e045 [ s|s^ f] : Well , it ’s because you also want t o know t his , or
som et hing like t hat right ?
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : So it ’s like you infer t he speaker int ent ,
fe004 [ s] : and t hen infer a plan , a larger plan from t hat , for which
y ou hav e t he addit ional inform at ion ,
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ e] : you ’re just being ext ra helpful .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
fe004 [ fh] : Um .
m n015 [ s^ bd] : Think [ disfm arker] Uh , well t his is just a m ent al
ex ercise .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : If you t hink about ,
m n015 [ s^ cs:qw] : focus on t his quest ion , how would you design
[ pause] t hat ?
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ qy] : Is it [ disfm arker] do you feel confident about saying t his is
part of t he language already t o [ disfm arker] t o det ect t hose plans ,
m n015 [ qh] : and why would anyone care about locat ion ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : if not , you know
m e045 [ b] : Mm m .
m n015 [ s] : and so fort h .
m n015 [ qrr.%−−] : Or do you act ually ,
m n015 [ s] : I m ean t his is perfect ly legit im at e ,
m n015 [ s] : and I [ disfm arker] I would not have any problem s wit h
erasing t his
m n015 [ s:s] : and say , t hat ’s all we can act ivat e , based on t he
ut t erance out of cont ext .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : And just by an addit ional link [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n015 [ qw] : What ?
m e045 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe004 [ b] : Right ,

m n015 [ s:s] : And t hen t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he m iracle
t hat we get out t he int ent ion , Go − t here , happens , based on what
we know about t hat ent it y , about t he user , about his various beliefs ,
goals , desires , blah − blah − blah .
fe004 [ %−] : like ,
fe004 [ s] : wit h cont ext and enough user inform at ion ,
fe004 [ b] : yeah .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : Absolut ely fine .
m n015 [ s] : But t his is t he sort of t hing , I [ disfm arker] I propose t hat
we t hink about ,
fe004 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ df] : so t hat we act ually end up wit h um , um , nodes for t he
discourse and ont ology
m n015 [ s] : so t hat we can put t hem int o our Bayes − net ,
m n015 [ s] : never change t hem ,
m n015 [ s:qw] : so we [ disfm arker] all t here is is " where is X " ,
m n015 [ s] : and , Ev a can play around wit h t he observed t hings ,
m n015 [ s] : and we can run our bet t er JavaBayes , and have it produce
som e out put .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : And for t he first t im e in t h in [ disfm arker] in t he world ,
we look at our out put ,
m n015 [ s] : and um [ disfm arker] and see uh whet her it [ disfm arker] it
’s any good .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : You know ?
m n015 [ fh] : I m ean ,
m e045 [ s] : Here ’s hoping .
m n015 [ qw^ br] : Hm m ?
m e045 [ s^ r|s^ f] : Here ’s hoping . Right ?
m e045 [ s^ e] : Now cross your fingers .
m n015 [ s^ bk|s^ df] : Yeah , I [ disfm arker] I m ean , for m e t his is just a
ba m at t er of curiosit y ,
m n015 [ s] : I wanna [ disfm arker] would like t o look at uh , what t his ad
− hoc process of designing a belief − net would act ually produce .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah . [ com m ent ] Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Mm m .
m n015 [ s^ e:qw] : If [ disfm arker] if we ask it where is som et hing .
m n015 [ s] : And , m aybe it also h enables you t o t hink about cert ain
t hings m ore specifically ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : um , com e up wit h int erest ing quest ions , t o which you
can find int erest ing answers .
m n015 [ s] : And , addit ionally it m ight fit in really nicely wit h t he paper .
m e045 [ b] : Um − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ df] : Because if [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] if we want an
ex am ple for t he paper , I suggest t here it is .

m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : So t h t his m ight be a nice opening paragraph for t he
paper as say ing , " y ou know people look at kinds of [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] at am biguit ies " ,
m n015 [ fh] : and um ,
m n015 [ s] : in t he lit erat ure t here ’s " bank "
m n015 [ s] : and what ever kinds of garden pat h phenom enon .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s:s] : And we can say , well , t hat ’s all nonsense . A ,
m n015 [ s] : A , uh t hese t hings are never really am biguous in
discourse , B ,
m n015 [ s] : B , don’t ever occur really in discourse ,
m n015 [ s:qw] : but norm al st at em ent s t hat seem com plet ely
unam biguous , such as " where is t he blah − blah " , act ually are t erribly
com plex , and com plet ely am biguous .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : And so , what every everybody else has been doing so far
in [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] you know , has been
com plet ely nonsensical , and can all go int o t he wast epaper bin ,
m n015 [ s.%−] : and t he only [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ j^ na|s^ aa^ j] : That ’s alway s a good way t o begin . Yeah .
Yeah .
m n015 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s.%−] : And t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he only
[ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ j] : I am great .
m n015 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s^ 2^ j] : All ot hers are useless .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ s^ ba.%] : That ’s good .
m n015 [ s^ ba] : Nice overt ure ,
m n015 [ s] : but , you know , just not really [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ bk|s^ bd] : OK , I ’m eja exaggerat ing ,
m n015 [ s^ df] : but t hat m ight be , you know , saying " hey " , you know
, som e st uff is [ disfm arker] is act ually com plex , if you look at it in
[ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in t he vacuum
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and ceases t o be com plex in realit y .
m n015 [ s] : And som e st uff t hat ’s as [ disfm arker] t hat ’s absolut ely
st raight forward in t he vacuum , is act ually t erribly com plex in realit y .
m n015 [ s] : Would be nice sort of , uh , also , nice , um bot t om − up
linguist ics , um , t y pe m essage .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : True .
m n015 [ s] : Versus t he old t op − down school .

m n015 [ s^ t c] : I ’m running out of t im e .
m n015 [ fg] : OK .
m e003 [ qw^ rt ] : When do you need t o st art wizarding ?
m n015 [ s] : At four t en .
m n015 [ s^ t ^ t c] : OK , t his is t he ot her bit of news .
m n015 [ s] : The subject s t oday know Fey ,
m n015 [ s] : so she can’t be here , and do t he wizarding .
m e045 [ b] : Huh .
m n015 [ s] : So I ’m gonna do t he wizarding
m n015 [ s] : and Thilo ’s gonna do t he inst ruct ing .
m e003 [ b] : Mm m .
m n015 [ s] : Also we ’re get t ing a [ disfm arker] a person who just got

m n015 [ s] : Uh a person from Oakland who is int erest ed in m aybe
cont inuing t he wizard bit once Fey leaves in August .
m n015 [ s] : And um , she ’s gonna look at it t oday .
m n015 [ s] : Which is good news in t he sense t hat if we want t o

m n015 [ s^ bsc] : We could .
m n015 [ fh] : And , um [ disfm arker]

m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : Look at t he result s we ’v e got t en so far for t he first ,
what ev er , fift y som e subject s ?
fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Fift y ?

m n015 [ s^ ar|s] : No , we ’re approaching t went y now .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : But , unt il Fey is leaving , we surely will hit t he [ disfm arker]

fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ fh] : And um ,
m n015 [ s] : so t hat ’s cool .
m n015 [ s] : Can a do m ore funky st uff .

m e045 [ qrr.%−−] : Or [ disfm arker] ?

m n015 [ h] : Um .
m e045 [ s|qy^ d^ g] : I guess it has t o be t ranscribed , huh ?
m n015 [ s] : We hav e uh , eh found som eone here who ’s hand st hand

m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ e^ rt ] : First dozen subject s
m e045 [ b] : Uh − huh .
