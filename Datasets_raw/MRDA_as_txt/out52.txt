m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e013 [ qw] : what are we t alking about t oday ?
m n007 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m n007 [ qy ^ rt ] : Do y ou have news from t he conference t alk ?
m n007 [ fh] : Uh ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : t hat was program m ed for y est erday [ disfm arker] I guess
.
m e013 [ h] : Uh [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s^ 2] : Yest erday
m e013 [ h] : Uh [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s] : Yest erday m orning on video conference .
m e013 [ h] : Uh ,
m n007 [ fh] : Well
m e013 [ s^ bk] : oh ,
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Oh . Conference call .
m e013 [ s^ fa] : I ’m sorry .
m e013 [ s] : I know [ disfm arker] now I know what you ’re t alking about .
m e013 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : No , nobody ’s t old m e anyt hing .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Alright .
m e018 [ s.%−] : Oh , t his was t he , uh , t alk where t hey were supposed
t o t ry t o decide [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ 2] : To [ disfm arker] t o decide what t o do ,
m n007 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Ah , right .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : No , t hat would have been a good t hing t o find out before
t his m eet ing ,
m e013 [ %−−] : t hat ’s .
m e013 [ s^ no] : No , I have no [ disfm arker] I have no idea .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e013 [ fh] : so
m e013 [ s^ co] : I m ean , let ’s [ disfm arker] let ’s assum e for right now
t hat we ’re just kind of plugging on ahead ,
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df] : because even if t hey t ell us t hat , uh , t he rules are
different , uh , we ’re st ill int erest ed in doing what we ’re doing .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : So what are you doing ?
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ h|s] : Uh , well , we ’ve [ disfm arker] a lit t le bit worked on t rying
t o see , uh , what were t he bugs and t he problem wit h t he lat encies .
fn002 [ s^ 2] : To im prove [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : So ,
m n007 [ s] : We t ook [ disfm arker] first we t ook t he LDA filt ers
m n007 [ s] : and , [ vocalsound] uh , we designed new filt ers ,

m n007 [ s^ e] : using uh recursive filt ers act ually .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : So when you say " we " , is t hat som et hing Sunil is
doing
m e013 [ qrr.%−−] : or is t hat [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ qw^ br^ d^ rt ] : I ’m sorry ?
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : Who is doing t hat ?
m n007 [ h|s] : Uh , us .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , oh .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
fn002 [ %] : But [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : So we t ook t he filt ers [ disfm arker] t he FIR filt ers
[ v ocalsound] and we [ com m ent ] designed , uh , IIR filt ers t hat have t he
sam e frequency response .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : Well , sim ilar , but t hat have short er delays .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : So t hey had t wo filt ers ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : one for t he low frequency bands
m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : and anot her for t he high frequency bands .
m n007 [ s] : And so we redesigned t wo filt ers .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : And t he low frequency band has sixt y − four m illiseconds
of delay ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : and t he high frequency band filt er has som et hing like
elev en m illiseconds com pared t o t he t wo hundred m illiseconds of t he
IIR filt ers .
m n007 [ s] : But it ’s not yet t est .
m n007 [ s] : So we have t he filt ers
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : but we st ill have t o im plem ent a rout ine t hat does
recursiv e filt ering
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m n007 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : You [ disfm arker] you had a discussion wit h Sunil
about t his t hough ?
m n007 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n007 [ s^ ar^ r.x ] : No .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s^ cs^ ng] : Yeah , you should t alk wit h him .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : No , I m ean , because t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker]
t he [ disfm arker] t he whole problem t hat happened before was
coordinat ion ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ s^ co] : So [ disfm arker] so you need t o discuss wit h him what
we ’re doing ,
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df] : uh , cuz t hey could be doing t he sam e t hing and
[ disfm arker] or som et hing .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fg] : Uh ,
m n007 [ %−−] : I [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk] : y eah ,
m n007 [ s^ no.%−−] : I don’t know if t h t hat ’s what t hey were t rying t o
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n007 [ s^ nd] : They were t rying t o do som et hing different like t aking ,
uh [ disfm arker] well , using filt er t hat t akes only a past
m n007 [ %−−] : and
m n007 [ s^ nd] : t his is just a lit t le bit different .
m n007 [ s^ cc] : But I will I will send him an em ail and t ell him exact ly
what we are doing ,
m n007 [ fh] : so .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s^ bk^ r] : yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ fh] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s^ co] : We just [ disfm arker] we just have t o be in cont act
m ore .
m e013 [ s^ df] : I t hink t hat [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he fact t hat
we [ disfm arker] we did t hat wit h [ disfm arker] had t hat t hing wit h t he
lat encies was indicat ive of t he fact t hat t here wasn’t enough
com m unicat ion .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Alright .
m n007 [ fg] : Um ,
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : Well , t here is w one , um , rem ark about t hese filt ers , t hat
t hey don’t have a linear phase .
m n007 [ fh] : So ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n007 [ s^ no] : Well , I don’t know ,
m n007 [ s] : perhaps it [ disfm arker] perhaps it doesn’t hurt
m n007 [ s^ df] : because t he phase is alm ost linear
m n007 [ %−−] : but .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,

m n007 [ s] : and so , yeah , for t he delay I gave you here , it ’s
[ disfm arker] it ’s , uh , com put ed on t he five hert z m odulat ion
frequency ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : which is t he [ disfm arker] m m m , well , t he m ost
im port ant for speech
m n007 [ fh] : so .
m n007 [ fh] : Uh ,
m n007 [ s] : t his is t he first t hing .
fn002 [ s.%−] : The low f f
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So t hat would be , uh , a reduct ion of a hundred and
t hirt y − six m illiseconds ,
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e.%−−] : which , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw] : What was t he t ot al we ended up wit h t hrough t he whole
sy st em ?
m n007 [ s] : Three hundred and t hirt y .
m e013 [ qy ^ d.%−−] : So t hat would be wit hin [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ s] : but t here are ot her point s act ually ,
m n007 [ fh] : uh ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : which will perhaps add som e m ore delay .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Is t hat som e ot her [ disfm arker] ot her st uff in t he
process were perhaps not very [ disfm arker] um perf well , not very
correct ,
m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : like t he downsam pling which w was sim ply dropping
fram es .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s^ cc] : so we will t ry also t o add a nice downsam pling
m n007 [ s^ e.%−−] : having a filt er t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : well , a low − pass filt er at [ disfm arker] at t went y − five
hert z .
m n007 [ s^ df] : Uh , because wh when [ disfm arker] when we look at
t he LDA filt ers , well , t hey are basically low − pass
m n007 [ s] : but t hey leave a lot of what ’s above t went y − five hert z .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ fh] : and so , yeah ,
m n007 [ s] : t his will be anot her filt er which would add t en m illiseconds
again .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s^ bk] : yeah ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ^ t c] : and t hen t here ’s a t hird t hing ,

m n007 [ s^ rt ] : is t hat , um , basically t he way on − line norm alizat ion
was done uh , is just using t his recursion on [ disfm arker] on t he um ,
um , on t he feat ure st ream ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] but t his is a filt er ,
m n007 [ s] : so it has also a delay .
m n007 [ fh] : Uh ,
m n007 [ s] : and when we look at t his filt er act ually it has a delay of
eight y − five m illiseconds .
m n007 [ s.%−] : So if we [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Eight y − five .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : If we want t o be very correct ,
m n007 [ s^ co] : so if we want t o [ disfm arker] t he est im at ion of t he
m ean t t t o [ disfm arker] t o be [ disfm arker] well , t he right est im at ion of
t he m ean , we hav e t o t t o t ake eight y − five m illiseconds in t he fut ure .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Hm m !
m e013 [ s^ nd] : That ’s a lit t le bit of a problem .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s^ bd] : But , well , when we add up everyt hing it ’s [ disfm arker]
it will be alright .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : We would be at six
m n007 [ s] : so , sixt y − five , plus t en , plus [ disfm arker] for t he
downsam pling ,
m n007 [ s] : plus eight y − five for t he on − line norm alizat ion .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : So it ’s
m e013 [ fg] : Uh ,
m e013 [ s^ ng.%−] : y eah , but t hen t here ’s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : plus [ disfm arker] plus eight y for t he neural net and PCA .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n007 [ s] : So it would be around t wo hundred and fort y [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : so , well ,
m e013 [ s] : Just [ disfm arker] just barely in t here .
m n007 [ s] : plus [ disfm arker] plus t he fram es ,
m n007 [ s] : but it ’s OK .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : What ’s t he allowable ?
m e013 [ s] : Two − fift y ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : unless t hey changed t he rules .
m n007 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s^ e] : Which t here is [ disfm arker] t here ’s som e discussion of .
m e013 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw] : What were t hey t hinking of changing it t o ?
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ h|s] : Uh , well t he people who had very low lat ency want it t o
be low [ disfm arker] uh , very [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] very very narrow
, uh , lat ency bound .
m e013 [ s] : And t he people who have longer lat ency don’t .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ b] : Huh .
m n007 [ b] : So , y eah .
m e013 [ s] : Unfort unat ely we ’re t he m ain ones wit h long lat ency ,
m e013 [ fh] : but
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Ah !
m e013 [ fh] : But , uh ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : y ou know , it ’s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fg] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ s] : and basically t he best proposal had som et hing like t hirt y
or fort y m illiseconds of lat ency .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : So .
m n007 [ fh] : Well .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : so t hey were basically [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : I m ean ,
m e013 [ s] : t hey were m ore or less t rading com put at ion for
perform ance
m e013 [ s] : and we were , uh , t rading lat ency for perform ance .
m e013 [ s] : And t hey were dealing wit h noise explicit ly and we weren’t ,
m e013 [ s] : and so I t hink of it as com plem ent ary ,
m e013 [ s^ e.%−] : t hat if we can put t he [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw^ br^ d^ rt ] : Think of it as what ?
m e013 [ s] : Com plem ent ary .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I t hink t he best sy st em s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : so , uh , everyt hing t hat we did in in a way it was
[ disfm arker] it was just adam ant ly insist ing on going in wit h a brain
dam aged sy st em ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : which is som et hing [ disfm arker] act ually , we ’ve done a
lot ov er t he last t hirt een years .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , [ v ocalsound] which is we say , well t his is t he way we
should do it .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen we do it .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen som eone else does som et hing t hat ’s st raight
forward .
m e013 [ s] : So , w t h w t his was a t est t hat largely had addit ive noise
m e013 [ s] : and we did [ disfm arker] we adde did absolut ely not hing
ex plicit ly t o handle ad addit ive noise .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Right .

m e013 [ s] : We just , uh , you know , t rained up syst em s t o be m ore
discrim inant .
m e013 [ fh|s] : And , uh , we did t his , uh , RASTA − like filt ering
m e013 [ s^ e] : which was done in t he log dom ain
m e013 [ s] : and was t ending t o handle convolut ional noise .
m e013 [ s] : We did [ disfm arker] we act ually did not hing about addit ive
noise .
m e013 [ fh] : So , um ,
m e013 [ s] : t he , uh , spect ral sub subt ract ion schem es a couple
places did seem t o seem t o do a nice job .
m e013 [ fh] : And so ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ s] : we ’re t alking about put t ing [ disfm arker] put t ing som e of
t hat in while st ill keeping som e of our st uff .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink y ou should be able t o end up wit h a syst em t hat ’s
bet t er t han bot h
m e013 [ s] : but clearly t he way t hat we ’re operat ing for t his ot her st uff
does inv olved som e lat ency t o [ disfm arker] t o get rid of m ost of t hat
lat ency .
m e013 [ s] : To get down t o fort y or fift y m illiseconds we ’d have t o
t hrow out m ost of what we ’re doing .
m e013 [ fh|s] : And [ disfm arker] and , uh , I don’t t hink t here ’s any
good reason for it in t he applicat ion act ually .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , you ’re [ disfm arker] you ’re [ disfm arker] you ’re
speaking t o a recognizer on a rem ot e server
m e013 [ s] : and , uh , having a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a quart er
second for som e processing t o clean it up . It doesn’t seem like it ’s
t hat big a deal .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ df] : These aren’t large v ocabulary t hings
m e013 [ s^ df] : so t he decoder shouldn’t t ake a really long t im e , and .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ s^ na] : And I don’t t hink anybody ’s gonna not ice t he
difference bet ween a quart er of a second of lat ency and t hirt y
m illiseconds of lat ency .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : No .
m e013 [ qw] : What [ disfm arker] what does [ disfm arker] wa was your
ex perience when y ou were doing t his st uff wit h , uh , t he [ disfm arker]
t he [ disfm arker] t he surgical , uh , uh , m icroscopes and so fort h .
m e013 [ fh|qw] : Um , how long was it from when som ebody , uh ,
finished an ut t erance t o when , uh , som et hing st art ed happening ?
m e018 [ h|s] : Um , we had a silence det ect or ,
m e018 [ fh] : so
m e018 [ s] : we would look for t he end of an ut t erance based on t he
silence det ect or .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e018 [ s^ no] : And I [ disfm arker] I can’t rem em ber now off t he t op of
m y head how m any fram es of silence we had t o det ect before we would
declare it t o be t he end of an ut t erance .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ fh] : Um ,
m e018 [ s.%−−] : but it was ,
m e018 [ fh] : uh ,
m e018 [ s] : I would say it was probably around t he order of t wo
hundred and fift y m illiseconds .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s^ bu] : and t hat ’s when you ’d st art doing t hings .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e018 [ s] : we did t he back t race at t hat point
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ e] : t o get t he answer .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : Of course t hat didn’t t ake t oo long at t hat point .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : No ,
m e018 [ s^ na] : no it was pret t y quick .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e018 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : so you [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker] so you had a
m e013 [ s^ bu^ r] : so you had a [ disfm arker] a quart er second delay
before , uh , plus som e lit t le processing t im e ,
m e018 [ %−] : t his w
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : and t hen t he [ disfm arker] t he m icroscope would st art
m ov ing or som et hing .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : And t here ’s physical inert ia t here ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : so probably t he [ disfm arker] t he m ot ion it self was all
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : And it felt t o , uh , t he users t hat it was inst ant aneous .
m e018 [ s^ e] : I m ean , as fast as t alking t o a person .
m e018 [ s^ df] : It [ disfm arker] t h I don’t t hink anybody ever com plained
about t he delay .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : so you would t hink as long as it ’s under half a second or
som et hing .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bd] : Uh , I ’m not an ex pert on t hat
m e013 [ fh] : but .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .

m e018 [ s] : I don’t rem em ber t he exact num bers
m e018 [ %−−] : but
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : it was som et hing like t hat .
m e018 [ s] : I don’t t hink you can really t ell .
m e018 [ s] : A person [ disfm arker] I don’t t hink a person can t ell t he
difference bet ween , uh , you know , a quart er of a second and a
hundred m illiseconds ,
m e018 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : I ’m not even sure if we can t ell t he difference bet ween a
quart er of a second and half a second .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ df] : I m ean it just [ disfm arker] it feels so quick .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , basically if you [ disfm arker] yeah , if you said , uh ,
um , " what ’s t he , uh , uh [ disfm arker] what ’s t he short est rout e t o
t he opera ? "
m e013 [ s] : and it t ook half a second t o get back t o you ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , [ vocalsound] it would be f
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , it m ight even be t oo abrupt .
m e013 [ s] : You m ight have t o put in a s a s [ vocalsound] a delay .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : I m ean , it m ay feel different t han t alking t o a person
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ df^ rt ] : because when we t alk t o each ot her we t end t o
st ep on each ot her ’s ut t erances .
m e018 [ s^ e] : So like if I ’m asking you a quest ion , you m ay st art
answering before I ’m even done .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : So it [ disfm arker] it would probably feel different
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s^ nd] : but I don’t t hink it would feel slow .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ fg] : Well , anyway ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , I t hink [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ cs] : we could cut [ disfm arker] we know what else , we could
cut down on t he neural net t im e
m e013 [ s^ cs^ e] : by [ disfm arker] by , uh , playing around a lit t le bit ,
m e013 [ s^ cs^ e] : going m ore int o t he past ,
m e013 [ s^ cs^ e] : or som et hing like t hat .
m e013 [ s] : We t we t alked about t hat .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : So is t he lat ency from t he neural net caused by how
far ahead y ou ’re looking ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So at least just t o underst and m aybe what t he difference

t oget her and how m uch you ’re get t ing from t he discrim inat ive ,
m e013 [ s] : what t he nonlinearit y does for you or doesn’t do for you .

m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ fg] : Well [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : y eah .
m n007 [ s] : Act ually what we want t o do , perhaps it ’s t o replace
[ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker] t o have som et hing t hat ’s discrim inant but

m n007 [ s^ rt ] : And t o see if it [ disfm arker] if it im proves ov over

m n007 [ s] : And if t he neural net is bet t er t han t his
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : or , well .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , well , t hat ’s what I m eant , is t o see whet her
[ disfm arker] whet her it [ disfm arker] having t he neural net really buys
y ou any t hing .
m n007 [ fh] : So .

m n007 [ %−] : Ye
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , I m ean , it doe did look like it buys you som et hing over
just t he KLT .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : But m aybe it ’s just t he discrim inat ion
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and m ay be [ disfm arker] yeah , m aybe t he
nonlinear discrim inat ion isn’t necessary .
fn002 [ s^ am ] : S m aybe .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ s^ am ^ r] : Maybe .
m e013 [ s] : Could be .
m e013 [ s] : Good [ disfm arker] good t o know .
m e013 [ s] : But t he ot her part you were saying was t he spect ral

m e013 [ s.%−−] : so y ou just kind of , uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qw] : At what st age do you do t hat ?
m e013 [ qy .%−−] : Do you [ disfm arker] you ’re doing t hat ,
m e013 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ s.%−−] : So it would be on t he
m n007 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s.%−] : We was t hink
m n007 [ s] : on [ disfm arker] on t he m el frequency bands ,
m n007 [ fh] : so . Yeah ,
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
fn002 [ %−] : we [ disfm arker] no [ disfm arker] nnn
m n007 [ s^ e] : be before every t hing .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e013 [ s^ co.%−] : so just do t hat on t he m el f
fn002 [ s] : We [ disfm arker] we was t hinking t o do before aft er VAD
fn002 [ fh] : or
fn002 [ s^ no] : Oh , [ com m ent ] we don’t know exact ly when it ’s bet t er .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s] : Before aft er VAD
fn002 [ %−−] : or [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s.%−] : and t hen
m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : So [ disfm arker] so y ou know t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat t he way t hat t hey ’re [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %] : Um .
m e013 [ s] : uh , one t hing t hat would be no [ disfm arker] good t o find
out about from t his conference call is t hat what t hey were t alking
about , what t hey ’re proposing doing , was having a t hird part y , um ,
run a good VAD , and [ disfm arker] and det erm ine boundaries .

fn002 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen given t hose boundaries , t hen have everybody do
t he recognit ion .
fn002 [ s^ 2] : Begin t o work .
m e013 [ s^ e] : The reason for t hat was t hat , um , uh [ disfm arker] if
som e one p one group put in t he VAD and anot her didn’t ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : uh , or one had a bet t er VAD t han t he ot her
m e013 [ s] : since t hat [ disfm arker] t hey ’re not viewing t hat as being
part of t he [ disfm arker] t he t ask ,
m e013 [ s] : and t hat any [ disfm arker] any m anufact urer would put a

det ect ion .
m e013 [ s] : It st ill wouldn’t be perfect
m e013 [ fh] : but I m ean ,
m e013 [ s] : e t he argum ent was " let ’s not have t hat be part of t his
t est . "
m e013 [ s^ e] : " Let ’s [ disfm arker] let ’s separat e t hat out . "
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And so ,
m e013 [ s] : uh , I guess t hey argued about t hat yest erday
m e013 [ %−−] : and ,
m e013 [ s^ fa] : yeah , I ’m sorry ,
m e013 [ s^ no] : I don’t [ disfm arker] don’t know t he answer
m e013 [ s^ cs] : but we should find out .
m e013 [ s] : I ’m sure we ’ll find out soon
m e013 [ s^ e] : what t hey , uh [ disfm arker] what t hey decided .
m e013 [ fh] : So , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Yeah , so t here ’s t he quest ion of t he VAD
m e013 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : but ot herwise it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s on t he
[ disfm arker] t he , uh [ disfm arker] t he m el fil filt er bank , uh , energies I
guess ?
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy.%−−] : You do [ disfm arker] doing t he [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm m , yeah .
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : And you ’re [ disfm arker] you ’re subt ract ing in t he
[ disfm arker] in t he [ disfm arker] in t he [ disfm arker] I guess it ’s power
[ disfm arker] power dom ain ,
m e013 [ fh|s^ bu] : uh , or [ disfm arker] or m agnit ude dom ain .
m e013 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Probably power dom ain , right ?
m e013 [ %] : why
m n007 [ s^ na] : I guess it ’s power dom ain , yeah .
m n007 [ s^ df] : I don’t rem em ber exact ly .
fn002 [ s^ no] : I don’t rem em ber .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ %−−] : But [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk] : y eah ,

m n007 [ s^ e] : so it ’s before everyt hing else ,
m e013 [ b] : yep .
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ na] : I m ean , if you look at t he t heory , it ’s [ disfm arker] it
should be in t he power dom ain
m e013 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] but , uh , I ’ve seen im plem ent at ions
where people do it in t he m agnit ude dom ain
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : I have asked people why
m e013 [ s] : and t hey shrug t heir shoulders and say , " oh , it works . "
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and t here ’s t his [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I guess t here ’s t his m yst erious [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean people who do t his a lot I guess have developed
lit t le t ricks of t he t rade .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s t his , um
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : you don’t just subt ract t he [ disfm arker] t he est im at e of
t he noise spect rum .
m e013 [ s.%−] : You subt ract t h t hat t im es [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ 2] : A lit t le bit m ore
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Or [ disfm arker] or less ,
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy^ bh^ d] : Really ?
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Huh !
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : And generat ed t his [ disfm arker] t his ,
m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m n007 [ fh] : um ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : so y ou have t he est im at ion of t he power spect ra of t he
noise ,
m n007 [ s] : and you m ult iply t his by a fact or which is depend
dependent on t he SNR .
fn002 [ s^ am ] : Hm m , m aybe .
m n007 [ fh] : So . Well .
m e018 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Hm m !
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : When t he speech lev when t he signal level is m ore
im port ant , com pared t o t his noise level , t he coefficient is sm all , and
around one .

m n007 [ s] : But when t he power le t he s signal level is uh sm all
com pared t o t he noise level , t he coefficient is m ore im port ant .
m n007 [ s] : And t his reduce act ually t he m usic m usical noise ,
m n007 [ fh] : uh
m e018 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Oh !
m n007 [ s^ e] : which is m ore im port ant during silence port ions ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : when t he s t he energy ’s sm all .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Hm m !
m n007 [ s] : So t here are t ricks like t his
m n007 [ fh] : but , m m m .
m e018 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Hm m !
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : So .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t he est im at e of t he noise spect rum a running
est im at e ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qrr.%−−] : Or [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Well , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] I m ean , t hat ’s what differs from
different [ disfm arker] different t asks and different s uh , spect ral
subt ract ion m et hods .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : I m ean , if [ disfm arker] if you have , uh , fair assurance
t hat , uh , t he noise is [ disfm arker] is quit e st at ionary , t hen t he
sm art est t hing t o do is use as m uch dat a as possible t o est im at e t he
noise ,
m e018 [ b] : Hm m !
m e013 [ s^ cs] : get a m uch bet t er est im at e , and subt ract it off .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : But if it ’s varying at all , which is gonna be t he case for
alm ost any real sit uat ion , you have t o do it on − line , uh , wit h som e
forget t ing fact or or som et hing .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : So do you [ disfm arker] is t here som e long window t hat
ex t ends int o t he past over which you calculat e t he average ?
m e013 [ s] : Well , t here ’s a lot of different ways of com put ing t he
noise spect rum .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So one of t he t hings t hat , uh , Hans − Guent er Hirsch
did , uh [ disfm arker] and pas and ot her people [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ df] : act ually , he ’s [ disfm arker] he wasn’t t he only one I
guess ,
m e013 [ s] : was t o , uh , t ake som e period of [ disfm arker] of
[ disfm arker] of speech and in each band , uh , develop a hist ogram .
m e013 [ s] : So , t o get a decent hist ogram of t hese energies t akes at
least a few seconds really .

m e013 [ s] : But , uh [ disfm arker] I m ean you can do it wit h a sm aller
am ount
m e013 [ s^ e] : but it ’s pret t y rough .
m e013 [ fh|s] : And , um , in fact I t hink t he NIST st andard m et hod of
det erm ining signal − t o − noise rat io is based on t his .
m e013 [ s.%−] : So [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : A couple seconds ?
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No , no ,
m e013 [ s^ nd] : it ’s based on t his kind of m et hod ,
m e013 [ s^ e^ nd] : t his hist ogram m et hod .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So y ou have a hist ogram .
m e013 [ s] : Now , if you have signal and y ou have noise , you basically
have t hese t wo bum ps in t he hist ogram ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : which you could approx im at e as t wo Gaussians .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : But wh don’t t hey overlap som et im es ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Oh , yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : So y ou have a m ixt ure of t wo Gaussians .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s] : And you can use EM t o figure out what it is . You know .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so basically now you have t his m ixt ure of
t wo Gaussians ,
m e013 [ s] : you [ disfm arker] you n know what t hey are ,
m e013 [ %−−] : and , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ fa] : I m ean , sorry ,
m e013 [ s^ bsc] : you est im at e what t hey are ,
m e013 [ fh] : and , uh ,
m e013 [ s] : so t his gives you what t he signal is and what t he noise e
energy is in t hat band in t he spect rum .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen you look over t he whole t hing
m e013 [ s] : and now you have a noise spect rum .
m e013 [ fh|s] : So , uh , Hans − Guent er Hirsch and ot hers have used
t hat kind of m et hod .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : And t he ot her t hing t o do is [ disfm arker] which is sort
of m ore t riv ial and obvious [ com m ent ] [ disfm arker] is t o , uh , uh ,
det erm ine t hrough m agical m eans t hat [ disfm arker] t hat , uh , t here ’s
no speech in som e period ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and t hen see what t he spect rum is .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e013 [ %−−] : but ,
m e013 [ s] : y ou know , it ’s [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat ’s t ricky t o do .

m e013 [ s^ df] : It has m ist akes .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Uh , and if you ’v e got enough t im e , uh , t his ot her
m et hod appears t o be som ewhat m ore reliable .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Uh , a variant on t hat for just det erm ining signal − t o −
noise rat io is t o just , uh [ disfm arker] you can do a w a uh [ disfm arker]
an it erat ive t hing , EM − like t hing , t o det erm ine m eans only .
m e013 [ s] : I guess it is EM st ill ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : but just [ disfm arker] just det erm ine t he m eans only .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Don’t worry about t he variances .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : And t hen you just use t hose m ean values as being t he
[ disfm arker] t he , uh uh signal − t o − noise rat io in t hat band .
m e018 [ qw.%−−] : But what is t he [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : it seem s like t his kind of t hing could add t o t he lat ency .
m e018 [ s^ df] : I m ean , depending on where t he window was t hat you
used t o calculat e [ pause] t he signal − t o − noise rat io .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ s^ aa] : sure .
m n007 [ %−−] : But [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s^ nd] : Not necessarily .
m e013 [ s^ df] : Cuz if you don’t look int o t he fut ure ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e018 [ s] : well t hat [ disfm arker] I guess t hat was m y quest ion ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : if you just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : y eah [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , if you just [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fh] : y eah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : if you [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : you , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : a at t he beginning y ou have som e [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ 2] : Guess .
m e013 [ s^ m ^ na] : est i som e guess
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and , uh , uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fg|s.%−] : Yeah , but it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : It ’s an int erest ing quest ion .
m e013 [ s] : I wonder how t hey did do it ?
m n007 [ s] : Act ually , it ’s a m m m [ disfm arker] If − if you want t o have a
good est im at ion on non − st at ionary noise you have t o look in t he
[ disfm arker] in t he fut ure .
m n007 [ fh] : I m ean , if you t ake y our window and build your hist ogram
in t his window , um , what you can ex pect is t o have an est im at ion of t h
of t he noise in [ disfm arker] in t he m iddle of t he window ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : not at t he end .
m n007 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]

fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Well , yeah ,
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : but what does [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker] what
[ disfm arker] what does Alcat el do ?
m n007 [ s.%−] : t he [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] but people
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw^ d^ e] : And [ disfm arker] and France Telecom .
m n007 [ %−] : The
m n007 [ s] : They just look in t he past .
m n007 [ s] : I guess it works because t he noise are , uh pret uh ,
alm ost st at ionary
m e013 [ s^ 2] : Pret t y st at ionary .
m e006 [ s^ t 1] : Pret t y st at ionary ,
m n007 [ fh] : but ,
m e006 [ b] : y eah .
m n007 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : Well , t he t hing , e e e e
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , y I m ean , y ou ’re t alking about non −

m e013 [ s] : but I t hink t hat spect ral subt ract ion is rarely [ disfm arker] is
[ disfm arker] is not gonna work really well for [ disfm arker] for non −

[ disfm arker] what is [ disfm arker] wh what ’s m ore com m on is t hat you

pract ically speaking .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ s^ df] : if y ou need a few seconds t o get a decent est im at e but
it ’s changed a lot in a few seconds , t hen it , you know , i it ’s kind of a

[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : But I t hink y um , Hirsch does experim ent wit h windows of

m n007 [ fh] : And
m n007 [ s^ ba] : well , five hundred wa was not so bad .

t he est im at ion of t he noise is [ disfm arker] is delayed .

’ll be som e t hings t hat are relat ively st at ionary
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s^ e] : where you can use one or anot her spect ral subt ract ion

m e013 [ s] : and ot her t hings where it ’s not so st at ionary
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker]

t hat falls bet ween y our m et hods ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,

m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ s^ no] : but I don’t know if , you know , if sinusoidally , uh ,
m odul am plit ude m odulat ed noise is [ disfm arker] is sort of a big

m e013 [ s.%−−] : I t hink t hat [ vocalsound] it ’s uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : We could probably get a really good est im at e of t he

m e018 [ s^ cs^ e] : and built t he averages from t hem .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Well .
m n007 [ %] : What [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ qw^ bu^ rt ] : What do you m ean ?
m e013 [ s] : Just cheat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ r] : You ’re saying , cheat .
m n007 [ s] : But if t he [ disfm arker] if t he noise is st at ionary perhaps
y ou don’t even need som e kind of noise est im at ion algorit hm .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .

m n007 [ s^ cs] : We just t ake t h t h t h t he beginning of t he ut t erance

m n007 [ %−] : but ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : you know , st at ionary [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : is it very useful

m e018 [ s] : Very slow adapt at ion .
m n007 [ s.%−] : and is t he c
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right ,
m e018 [ %−] : t h
m e013 [ s] : t he word " st at ionary " is [ disfm arker] has a very precise

m e013 [ s] : But , you know , in [ disfm arker] in signal − processing really
what we ’re t alking about I t hink is t hings t hat change slowly , uh ,

m e013 [ s^ e] : So if you ’re driving along in a car I [ disfm arker] I would
t hink t hat m ost of t he t im e t he nat ure of t he noise is going t o change

m e006 [ s] : it can be short er t han t hat .
m e006 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e006 [ fh|s] : Well , I ’ve [ disfm arker] I ’ve t alked t o som e of you
already .
m e006 [ fh|s^ cc] : Um , but I ’m , uh , looking int o ext ending t he work

m e006 [ fh|s] : Um , t hey [ disfm arker] t hey have a syst em t hat ’s , uh ,
a m ult i − band , um , syst em
m e006 [ s] : but t heir m ult i − band is [ disfm arker] is a lit t le different
t han t he way t hat we ’ve been doing m ult i − band in t he past ,
m e006 [ s^ e] : where um [ disfm arker] Where we ’ve been @ @
[ com m ent ] uh t aking [ pause] um [ pause] [ vocalsound] sub − band
feat ures and i t raining up t hese neural net s and [ disfm arker] on
[ disfm arker] on phonet ic t arget s ,
m e006 [ s^ e] : and t hen com bining t hem som e som ehow down t he line
,
m e006 [ fh] : um ,
m e006 [ s] : t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re t aking sub − band feat ures
and , um , t raining up a det ect or t hat det ect s for , um , t hese phonet ic
feat ures
m e006 [ s^ e] : for ex am ple , um , he present s um , uh , a det ect or t o
det ect sonorance .
m e006 [ s.%−−] : And so what [ disfm arker] what it basically is
[ disfm arker] is , um [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s] : at t he lowest level , t here [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it
’s an OR ga I m ean , it ’s an AND gat e .
m e006 [ s^ e] : So , uh , on each sub − band you have several
independent t est s ,
m e006 [ s^ e] : t o t est whet her um , t here ’s t he exist ence of
sonorance in a sub − band .

m e006 [ s] : And t hen , um , it c it ’s com bined by a soft AND gat e .
m e006 [ s.%−−] : And at t he [ disfm arker] at t he higher level ,
m e006 [ s.%−−] : for ev ery [ disfm arker] if ,
m e006 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s] : The higher level t here ’s a soft OR gat e .
m e006 [ s] : Uh , so if [ disfm arker] if t his det ect or det ect s um , t he
presence of [ disfm arker] of sonorance in any of t he sub − bands , t hen
t he det ect uh , t he OR gat e at t he t op says , " OK , well t his fram e has
ev idence of sonorance . "
m e006 [ s.%−] : And t hese are all [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : What are [ disfm arker] what are som e of t he low lev el
det ect ors t hat t hey use ?
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e006 [ s^ rt ] : Well , t he low level det ect ors are logist ic regressions .
m e006 [ fh] : Um ,
m e006 [ %−−] : and
m e006 [ fh] : t he , uh [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s.%−] : t he one o
m e013 [ s] : So t hat , by t he way , basically is a [ disfm arker] is one of
t he unit s in our [ disfm arker] in our [ disfm arker] our neural net work .
m e013 [ s^ e] : So t hat ’s all it is .
m e013 [ s^ e] : It ’s a sig it ’s a sigm oid ,
m e006 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : uh , wit h weight ed sum at t he input ,
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e006 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ e] : which you t rain by gradient [ pause] descent .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e006 [ s] : so he uses , um , an EM algorit hm t o [ disfm arker] t o um
t rain up t hese um param et ers for t he logist ic regression .
m e006 [ %−] : The [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg] : Well , act ually ,
m e013 [ fg] : y eah ,
m e013 [ s] : so I was using EM t o get t he t arget s .
m e013 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so you have t his [ disfm arker] t his
[ disfm arker] t his AND gat e [ disfm arker] what we were calling an AND
gat e , but it ’s a product [ disfm arker] product rule t hing at t he out put .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t hen he uses , uh , i u and t hen feeding int o t hat
are [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ fa] : I ’m sorry ,
m e013 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : t here ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s an OR at t he
out put , isn’t it ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e006 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : so t hat ’s t he product .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t hen ,

m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ s] : t hen he has each of t hese AND t hings .
m e013 [ fh] : And ,
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : so t hey ’re lit t le neural [ disfm arker] neural unit s .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ fh] : and , um ,
m e013 [ s] : t hey hav e t o have t arget s .
m e013 [ s] : And so t he t arget s com e from EM .
m e018 [ qy .%−−] : And so are each of t hese , low level det ect ors
[ com m ent ] [ disfm arker] are t hey ,
m e018 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ] : are t hese som et hing t hat you decide ahead of t im e ,
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ e] : like " I ’m going t o look for t his part icular feat ure
m e018 [ qrr^ d^ e^ rt ] : or I ’m going t o look at t his frequency , "
m e018 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw] : What [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker] what are t hey
looking at ?
m e006 [ fg] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw] : What are t heir input s ?
m e006 [ fg] : Uh
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Right ,
m e006 [ s.%−−] : so t he [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e006 [ s] : so at each for each sub − band [ com m ent ] t here are
basically , uh , several m easures of SNR and [ disfm arker] and
correlat ion .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Ah ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e006 [ fh] : Um ,
m e018 [ s^ bk^ r] : OK .
m e006 [ s] : um and he said t here ’s like t went y of t hese per
[ disfm arker] per sub − band .
m e006 [ fh] : Um ,
m e006 [ s] : and for [ disfm arker] for every s every sub − band , e you
[ disfm arker] you just pick ahead of t im e , um , " I ’m going t o have like
five [ pause] i independent logist ic t est s . "
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ s] : And you init ialize t hese param et ers , um , in som e
[ disfm arker] som e way
m e006 [ s] : and use EM t o com e up wit h y our t raining t arget s for a
[ disfm arker] for t he [ disfm arker] t he low − level det ect ors .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e006 [ s] : And t hen , once you get t hat done , you [ disfm arker] you
[ disfm arker] you t rain t he whole [ disfm arker] whole t hing on m axim um
likelihood .
m e006 [ fh] : Um ,
m e006 [ s] : and h he shows t hat using t his [ disfm arker] t his m et hod t o
det ect sonorance is it ’s very robust com pared t o , um [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] t o t ypical , uh , full − band Gaussian m ixt ures um
est im at ions of [ disfm arker] of sonorance .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ fh] : And , uh
m e006 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s] : so t hat ’s just [ disfm arker] t hat ’s just one det ect or .
m e006 [ s] : So you can im agine building m any of t hese det ect ors on
different feat ures .
m e006 [ s] : You get enough of t hese det ect ors t oget her , um , t hen
y ou hav e enough inform at ion t o do , um , higher level discrim inat ion ,
m e006 [ s^ e] : for exam ple , discrim inat ing bet ween phones
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ s] : and t hen you keep working your way up unt il you
[ disfm arker] you build a full recognizer .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ fh|s] : So , um , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he direct ion which I
’m [ disfm arker] I ’m t hinking about going in m y quals .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Cool .
m e013 [ s] : You know , it has a num ber of propert ies t hat I really liked .
m e013 [ s^ e] : I m ean , one is t he going t owards , um , using narrow
band inform at ion for , uh , ph phonet ic feat ures of som e sort
m e013 [ s^ e] : rat her t han just , uh , im m ediat ely going for t he
[ disfm arker] t he t ypical sound unit s .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : Anot her t hing I like about it is t hat you t t his t hing is going
t o be t rained [ disfm arker] explicit ly t rained for a product of errors rule ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : which is what , uh , Allen keeps point ing out t hat
Flet cher observ ed in t he t went ies ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : uh , for people list ening t o narrow band st uff . That ’s
Friday ’s t alk , by t he way .
m e013 [ fh] : And t hen , um ,
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : Uh , t he t hird t hing I like about it is ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : uh , and we ’ve played around wit h t his in a different
kind of way a lit t le bit
m e013 [ s^ e] : but it hasn’t been our dom inant way of [ disfm arker] of
operat ing anyt hing ,
m e013 [ s] : um , t his issue of where t he t arget s com e from .

m e013 [ s] : So in our case when we ’ve been t raining it m ult i − band
t hings , t he way we get t he t arget s for t he individual bands is , uh ,
t hat we get t he phonet ic label [ disfm arker] for t he sound t here
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and we say , " OK , we t rain every [ disfm arker] "
m e013 [ s] : What t his is saying is , OK , t hat ’s m aybe what our ult im at e
goal is [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : or not ult im at e but penult im at e [ vocalsound] goal is
get t ing t hese [ disfm arker] t hese sm all sound unit s .
m e013 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker] but , um ,
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : along t he way how m uch should we , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : uh , what should we be t raining t hese int erm ediat e
t hings for ?
m e013 [ s^ no] : I m ean , because , uh , we don’t know uh , t hat t his is
a part icularly good feat ure .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , t here ’s no way , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : som eone in t he audience yest erday was asking , " well
couldn’t you have people go t hrough and m ark t he individual bands
and say where t he [ disfm arker] where it was sonorant or not ? "
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : But , you know , I t hink having a bunch of people list ening
t o crit ical band wide , [ vocalsound] uh , chunks of speech t rying t o
det erm ine whet her [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] I t hink it ’d be im possible .
m e006 [ s^ ba] : Ouch .
m e013 [ s^ df] : It ’s all gonna sound like [ disfm arker] like sine waves t o
y ou , m ore or less .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Well not
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , it ’s g all g
m e013 [ s] : narrow band
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ s] : i I m I t hink it ’s very hard for som eone t o [ disfm arker] t o
[ disfm arker] a person t o m ake t hat det erm inat ion .
m e013 [ fh] : So , um ,
m e013 [ fh|s^ no] : um , we don’t really know how t hose should be
labeled .
m e013 [ s] : It could sh be t hat you should , um , not be paying t hat
m uch at t ent ion t o , uh , cert ain bands for cert ain sounds , uh , in
order t o get t he best result .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So , um , what we have been doing t here , just sort of
m ix ing it all t oget her , is cert ainly m uch [ disfm arker] m uch cruder t han
t hat .
m e013 [ s^ e] : We t rained t hese t hings up on t he [ disfm arker] on t he ,
uh t he final label .

m e013 [ s] : Now we have I guess done experim ent s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : y ou ’v e probably done st uff where you have , um , done
separat e , uh , Vit erbis on t he different [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e006 [ s^ e^ rt ] : Forced alignm ent on t he sub − band labels ?
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : You ’ve done t hat .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Did [ disfm arker] did t hat help at all ?
m e006 [ h|s^ aap] : Um , it helps for one or t one it erat ion
m e006 [ s^ arp] : but um , anyt hing aft er t hat it doesn’t help .
m e013 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so t hat m ay or m ay t it [ disfm arker] t hat
aspect of what he ’s doing m ay or m ay not be helpful
m e013 [ s^ df.%−−] : because in a sense t hat ’s t he sam e sort of t hing .
You ’re t aking global inform at ion and det erm ining what you
[ disfm arker] how y ou should [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : But t his is [ disfm arker] t his is , uh , I t h I t hink a lit t le m ore
direct .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : How did t hey m easure t he perform ance of t heir
det ect or ?
m e013 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Well , he ’s look he ’s just act ually looking at , uh , t he
confusions bet ween sonorant and non − sonorant .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So he hasn’t applied it t o recognit ion
m e013 [ s] : or if he did he didn’t t alk about it .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And one of t he concerns in t he audience , act ually ,
was t hat [ disfm arker] t hat , um , t he , uh ,
m e013 [ s] : uh [ disfm arker] he [ disfm arker] he did a com parison t o ,
uh , y ou know , our old foil ,
m e013 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] t he nast y old st andard recognizer wit h
[ v ocalsound] m el [ disfm arker] m el filt er bank at t he front , and H M Ms
, and [ disfm arker] and so fort h .
m e013 [ s] : And , um , it didn’t do nearly as well ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : especially in [ disfm arker] in noise .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : one of t he good quest ions in t he audience was , well ,
y eah , but t hat wasn’t t rained for t hat .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , t his use of a very sm oot h , uh , spect ral envelope
is som et hing t hat , you know , has evolved as being generally a good
t hing for speech recognit ion
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but if you knew t hat what you were gonna do is det ect
sonorant s or not [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s^ e] : So sonorant s and non − sonorant s is [ disfm arker] is
[ disfm arker] is alm ost like voiced − unvoiced , except I guess t hat t he
v oiced st ops are [ disfm arker] are also called " obst ruent s " .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : so it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu] : it ’s [ disfm arker] uh , but wit h t he except ion of t he
st ops I guess it ’s pret t y m uch t he sam e as voiced − unvoiced ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker] so [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ fh] : So , um ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : if y ou knew you were doing t hat ,
m e013 [ s] : if y ou were doing som et hing say for a [ disfm arker] a , uh
[ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a Vocoder , you wouldn’t use t he sam e kind
of feat ures .
m e013 [ s] : You would use som et hing t hat was sensit ive t o t he
periodicit y and [ disfm arker] and not just t he envelope .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , and so in t hat sense it was an unfair t est .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s] : so I t hink t hat t he quest ioner was right .
m e013 [ s] : It [ disfm arker] it was in t hat sense an unfair t est .
m e013 [ s] : Nonet heless , it was one t hat was int erest ing because , uh
, t his is what we are act ually using for speech recognit ion ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : t hese sm oot h envelopes .
m e013 [ s] : And t his says t hat perhaps even , you know , t rying t o use
t hem in t he best way t hat we can , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat we ordinarily do , wit h , you know , Gaussian m ixt ures and H M Ms
[ com m ent ] and so fort h , you [ disfm arker] you don’t , uh , act ually do
t hat well on det erm ining whet her som et hing is sonorant or not .
m e018 [ qy .%−] : Didn’t t hey [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ e] : Which m eans you ’re gonna m ake errors bet ween
sim ilar sounds t hat are son sonorant or obst ruent .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Didn’t t hey also do som e kind of an oracle experim ent
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ e^ rt ] : where t hey said " if we [ pause] could det ect t he
sonorant s perfect ly [ pause] and t hen show how it would im prove
speech recognit ion ?
m e018 [ s^ df] : I t hought I rem em ber hearing about an experim ent like
t hat .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : The − t hese sam e people ?
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ no] : I don’t rem em ber t hat .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : That would [ disfm arker] t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa] : y ou ’re right ,

m e013 [ s^ na] : t hat ’s exact ly t he quest ion t o follow up t his discussion
, is
m e013 [ s^ na] : suppose you did t hat , uh , got t hat right .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m n007 [ qw] : What could be t he ot her low level det ect ors , I m ean , for
[ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] Ot her kind of feat ures ,
m n007 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ s^ e] : in addit ion t o det ect ing sonorant s
m n007 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e006 [ h] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Th − t hat ’s what you want t o [ disfm arker] t o
[ disfm arker] t o go for also
m e006 [ qw.%−−] : What t
m n007 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e006 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Oh , build ot her [ disfm arker] ot her det ect ors on

m n007 [ qy ^ 2^ d^ rt ] : Ot her low level det ect ors ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e006 [ h] : Um ,
m e006 [ s^ t 1] : uh Let ’s see ,
m e006 [ fh] : um ,
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e006 [ s^ no] : I d I don’t know .
m e006 [ fh] : e Um ,
m e006 [ fh] : um ,
m e006 [ s] : I m ean , w easiest t hing would be t o go [ disfm arker] go do
som e voicing st uff
m e006 [ s] : but t hat ’s very sim ilar t o sonorance .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ fh] : Um ,
m e018 [ s.%−−] : When we [ disfm arker] when we t alked wit h John Ohala
t he ot her day we m ade a list of som e of t he t hings t hat w
m e006 [ b] : Yeah .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Oh ! OK .
m e018 [ s^ e] : like fricat ion ,
m e006 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ e] : abrupt closure ,
m e006 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ e] : R − coloring ,
m e018 [ s^ e] : nasalit y ,
m e018 [ s^ e] : voicing [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : so t here ’s a half dozen like t hat t hat are [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fh] : Uh .

m e006 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e006 [ s^ bk^ m ] : nasalit y .
m e013 [ s] : Now t his was com ing at it from a different angle
m e013 [ s^ na] : but m aybe it ’s a good way t o st art .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , t hese are t hings which , uh , John felt t hat a
[ disfm arker] a , uh [ disfm arker] a hum an annot at or would be able t o
reliably m ark .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e013 [ s] : So t he sort of t hings he felt would be difficult for a hum an
annot at or t o reliably m ark would be t ongue posit ion kinds of t hings .
m e006 [ s^ 2] : Placing st uff ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : There ’s also t hings like st ress .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : You can look at st ress .
m e006 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ nd] : But st ress doesn’t , uh , fit in t his t hing of com ing up
wit h feat ures t hat will dist inguish words from one anot her ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
m e013 [ s^ na] : It ’s a [ disfm arker] it ’s a good t hing t o m ark
m e013 [ s^ df] : and will probably help us ult im at e wit h recognit ion
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e018 [ s] : t here ’s a few cases where it can like perm it [ com m ent ]
and perm it .
m e013 [ %−] : but [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ e] : But [ disfm arker] t hat ’s not very com m on in English .
m e018 [ s^ e] : In ot her languages it ’s m ore uh , im port ant .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Well , yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : but i eit her case you ’d writ e PERMIT ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
m e013 [ s] : So you ’d get t he word right .
m e018 [ s^ ar|s] : No , I ’m saying , i i e I t hought you were saying t hat
st ress doesn’t help y ou dist inguish bet ween words .
m e013 [ h] : Um ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see what you ’re say ing .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : As long as you get [ disfm arker] The sequence ,
m e013 [ s] : We ’re g if we ’re doing [ disfm arker] if we ’re t alking about
t ranscript ion as opposed t o som et hing else [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s] : So where it could help is m aybe at a higher level .

m e006 [ s] : Like a underst anding applicat ion .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ m ^ na] : Underst anding ,
m e018 [ b] : y eah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Exact ly .
m e013 [ s] : But t hat ’s t his aft ernoon ’s m eet ing .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ j] : We don’t underst and anyt hing in t his m eet ing .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : so t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : y eah ,
m e013 [ s] : t hat ’s , you know , a neat [ disfm arker] neat t hing
m e013 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : and , uh [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : S so , um , Ohala ’s going t o help do t hese , uh
[ pause] t ranscript ions of t he m eet ing dat a ?
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ h] : Uh ,
m e018 [ s^ no] : well I don’t know .
m e018 [ s^ df] : We d we sort of didn’t get t hat far .
m e018 [ fh|s] : Um , we just t alked about som e possible feat ures t hat
could be m arked by hum ans
m e018 [ fh] : and , um ,
m e006 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ s] : because of having m aybe som e ext ra t ranscriber t im e we
t hought we could go t hrough and m ark som e port ion of t he dat a for
t hat .
m e018 [ fh] : And , uh [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , t hat ’s not an im m ediat e problem , t hat we don’t
im m ediat ely hav e a lot of ext ra t ranscriber t im e .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but , uh , in t he long t erm I guess Chuck is
gonna cont inue t he dialogue wit h John
m e018 [ s^ bk] : right .
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and , uh ,
m e013 [ s] : and , we ’ll [ disfm arker] we ’ll end up doing som e I t hink .
m e018 [ s] : I ’m definit ely int erest ed in t his area , t oo ,
m e018 [ s^ e] : f uh , acoust ic feat ure st uff .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ fh] : So .

m e013 [ s] : Yeah , I t hink it ’s an int erest ing [ disfm arker] int erest ing
way t o go .
m e006 [ s^ ba] : Cool .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s] : I say it like " said − int " . I t hink it has a num ber of good
t hings .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ fh|qy ^ co^ d^ rt ^ t c] : so , uh , y you want t o t alk m aybe a c t wo
or t hree m inut es about what we ’ve been t alking about t oday and
ot her days ?
m e026 [ s^ bk.%−] : Ri
m e026 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e026 [ s^ aa] : OK ,
m e026 [ fh] : so , um ,
m e026 [ s] : we ’re int erest ed in , um , m et hods for far m ike speech
recognit ion ,
m e026 [ s^ e] : um , [ pause] m ainly , uh , m et hods t hat deal wit h t he
rev erberat ion [ pause] in t he far m ike signal .
m e026 [ fh] : So , um ,
m e026 [ s^ e] : one approach would be , um , say MSG and PLP , like
was used in Aurora one
m e026 [ s] : and , um , t here are ot her approaches which act ually
at t em pt t o [ pause] rem ove t he reverberat ion , inst ead of being robust
t o it like MSG .
m e026 [ s] : And so we ’re int erest ed in , um , com paring t he
perform ance of [ pause] um , a robust approach like MSG wit h t hese ,
um , speech enhancem ent or de − reverber de − reverberat ion
approaches .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e026 [ s] : And , um , [ vocalsound] it looks like we ’re gonna use t he
Meet ing Recorder digit s dat a for t hat .
m n007 [ s^ bu] : And t he de − reverberat ion algorit hm ,
m n007 [ qy ^ rt ] : do you have [ disfm arker] can you give som e m ore
det ails on t his
m n007 [ qy ^ e^ rt ] : or [ disfm arker] ? Does it use one m icrophone ?
m e026 [ %] : o
m n007 [ qy^ d^ e^ rt ] : Several m icrophones ?
m e026 [ %] : o
m n007 [ qy.%−] : Does it [ disfm arker] ?
m e026 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e026 [ fh] : well , um ,
m e026 [ s.%−] : t here was som et hing t hat was done by , um , a guy
nam ed Carlos , I forget his last nam e , [ com m ent ] who worked wit h
Hy nek , who , um ,
m e013 [ s] : Avendano .
m e026 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m e026 [ fh] : Who , um ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e026 [ s] : um , it was like RASTA in t he sense t hat of it was , um , de −
conv olut ion by filt ering
m e026 [ s] : um , ex cept he used a longer t im e window ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e026 [ s^ e] : like a second m ay be .
m e026 [ s^ df] : And t he reason for t hat is RASTA ’s t im e window is t oo
short t o , um include t he whole , um , reverberat ion [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s^ no] : um , I don’t know what y ou call it
m e026 [ s] : t he reverberat ion response .
m e026 [ s] : I if y ou see wh if you see what I m ean .
m e026 [ s^ df] : The reverberat ion filt er from m y m out h t o t hat m ike is
like [ disfm arker] it ’s t got it ’s t oo long in t he [ disfm arker] in t he t im e
dom ain for t he um [ disfm arker] for t he RASTA filt ering t o t ake care of it
.
m e026 [ fh] : And , um ,
m e026 [ s] : t hen t here are a couple of ot her speech enhancem ent
approaches which haven’t been t ried for speech recognit ion yet
m e026 [ s] : but hav e just been t ried for enhancem ent ,
m e026 [ s^ e] : which , um , have t he assum pt ion t hat um , you can do
LPC um analysis of t h of t he signal you get at t he far m icrophone
m e026 [ s^ rt ] : and t he , um , all pole filt er t hat you get out of t hat
should be good .
m e026 [ s^ e^ rt ] : It ’s just t he , um , excit at ion signal [ com m ent ] t hat
is going t o be dist ort ed by t he reverberat ion
m e026 [ s^ cs] : and so you can t ry and reconst ruct a bet t er excit at ion
signal
m e026 [ s^ cs] : and , um , feed t hat t hrough t he i um , all pole filt er
and get enhanced speech wit h reverberat ion reduced .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : There ’s also t his , uh , um , uh , echo cancellat ion st uff
t hat we ’v e sort of been chasing ,
m e013 [ fh] : so , uh
m e013 [ s.%−−] : we have , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : and when we ’re saying t hese digit s now we do have a
close m icrophone signal
m e013 [ s] : and t hen t here ’s t he dist ant m icrophone signal .
m e013 [ s] : And you could as a kind of baseline say , " OK , given t hat
we have bot h of t hese , uh , we should be able t o do , uh , a
cancellat ion . "

m e013 [ s] : So t hat , uh , um , we [ disfm arker] we , uh , essent ially
ident ify t he sy st em in bet ween [ disfm arker] t he linear t im e invariant
sy st em bet ween t he m icrophones and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker]
and [ disfm arker] and re and invert it ,
m e013 [ s] : uh , or [ disfm arker] or cancel it out t o [ disfm arker] t o
som e [ disfm arker] som e reasonable approxim at ion
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ e] : t hrough one m et hod or anot her .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Uh , t hat ’s not a pract ical t hing ,
m e013 [ s] : uh , if you have a dist ant m ike , you don’t have a close
m ike ordinarily ,
m e013 [ s] : but we t hought t hat m ight m ake [ disfm arker] also m ight
m ake a good baseline .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , it st ill won’t be perfect because t here ’s noise .
m e013 [ %−−] : Uh , but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : And t hen t here are s uh , t here are single m icrophone
m et hods t hat I t hink people have done for , uh [ disfm arker] for t his
kind of de − reverberat ion .
m e013 [ qy^ rt ] : Do y do you know any references t o any ?
m e013 [ s^ df] : Cuz I [ disfm arker] I w I was [ disfm arker] w w I
[ disfm arker] I lead him down a [ disfm arker] a bad pat h on t hat .
m n007 [ h] : Uh ,

[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−−] : But .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : well , not [ disfm arker] not very [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Well , t here is t he Avendano work ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : but also t rying t o m m m , uh [ disfm arker] t rying t o f t
