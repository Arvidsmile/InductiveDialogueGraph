m e011 [ z] : Or , I like it , also , like t his .
m e013 [ z] : OK Yeah .
m e018 [ z] : Yeah I [ disfm arker] I just t ried it .
m e011 [ z] : So you see t he [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ z] : I t hink m y [ pause] head is t oo big .
m e011 [ z] : So .
fe008 [ z] : And t here is a problem t hat you can hear it com e and go ,
fe016 [ z] : It ’s t oo ba
fe008 [ z] : cuz when y ou t urn y our head , t hen [ pause] you drift away
from t he m icrophone .
m e018 [ z] : Oh y eah .
m n005 [ z] : Yeah .
fe016 [ z] : Oh , t hat ’s t rue .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s.%−] : OK [ pause] so [ pause] let ’s uh
m e018 [ z] : The dist ance isn’t [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ z] : course t hat ’s t rue of a lapel as well .
m e013 [ s^ co^ rt ^ t ] : Let ’s discuss agenda it em s .
m e011 [ s^ t 1.%−] : I should have brought m ore [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qo^ rt ^ t ] : What did we have ?
fe008 [ b] : Yes .
m e013 [ s] : uh [ pause] You [ disfm arker] you were announce som e
t hings
m e011 [ s^ rt ^ t .%−−] : I have a [ pause] couple t hings about speaker
form [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ t ] : about form s in general .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ rt ^ t ] : OK , form s [ pause] is one t hing
m e013 [ s^ j^ rt ^ t ] : uh , t here ’s st at us on [ pause] on t he uh
[ v ocalsound] t ranscript ion discussion [ pause] [ pause] which will t ake
us about t hirt y seconds
m e011 [ s] : St uff .
m e013 [ s^ rt ^ t ] : uh [ pause] and t hen uh Jose [ pause] as usual
[ pause] uh , t he one am ong us who ’s act ually doing a bunch of t hings
on t his
m e013 [ s.%−−] : uh He has [ pause] t his and I t hink we can have som e
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : I was just glancing t hrough it , so I t hink we have
som et hing t o discuss [ pause] about .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ t ] : um and um We just sent in t hat uh NSF pre − proposal
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : but I don’t t hink t here ’s m uch t o say about t hat except
we ’v e sent it in and we ’ll see what happens
m e013 [ h|qo^ rt ] : um Anybody ?
m e013 [ qo^ rt ] : Any t hing ?
m e013 [ qo] : Anyt hing else [ pause] going on ?
fe008 [ s] : That ’s it .
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No .

m e013 [ s^ bk^ rt ^ t c] : OK .
m e013 [ fh|qo^ cs^ rt ] : So Why don’t we do it in t hat order ?
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ co] : Go ahead .
m e011 [ s^ fa] : I uh [ pause] probably should have print ed out m ore of
t hese .
m e011 [ s] : So one of t he t hings t hat I ’ve been doing wit h t he digit s
form s is I ’v e been adding m ore and m ore speaker specific inform at ion
t o t hem
m e011 [ s] : and it ’s get t ing pret t y crowded and you have t o fill it out
each t im e .
m e011 [ s] : So , what I t hought was , it would be nice t o have a single
speaker form t hat you fill out once .
m e011 [ s] : And t hen , on t he digit s form you just have t o put your
nam e down and y ou can look it up from t he speaker form .
m e011 [ s] : so , I had a first pass of it ,
m e011 [ s] : and I [ pause] spoke wit h Jane a bit about how t o specify
what language and educat ion and t hat sort of st uff
m e011 [ s] : and so I have a first pass at it .
m e011 [ s] : And I was uh just wondering if people had any com m ent s
on inform at ion t hat should or shouldn’t be on it .
m e011 [ s^ fa] : And I [ pause] only did one copy which was really st upid
of m e .
m e011 [ s] : um So I ’ll just sort of say what it ’s on and t hen I can hand
it around .
m e011 [ s] : So t he t op of it is [ pause] uh , Nam e , Sex Em ail or Ot her
Cont act Inform at ion .
m e011 [ s] : And I put t he cont act inform at ion just in case we have
people wit h t he sam e nam e , so t hat you can dist inguish t hem ,
m e011 [ s] : and t hen also just t o have a separat e cont act from t he
consent form .
m e011 [ s] : And t hen , uh , we t alked a lit t le bit about whet her t o do
[ disfm arker] how we get at t he background .
m e011 [ s] : And we could do profession , but it ’s so uniform t hat we
figured what was m ore im port ant was [ pause] act ually t he educat ion
lev el .
m e011 [ s] : um At least t hat would get at som e idea of t heir
background .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : So I have a [ disfm arker] And s
fe008 [ fg|s^ e] : Well [ disfm arker] and it ’s also relevant t o st at us .
fe008 [ s^ cc] : I c I can insert t hat .
m e011 [ s^ aa^ m ] : and relevant t o st at us .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : So t hat [ pause] what I have is uh
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : St at us ?
fe008 [ s] : Which m ight in af affect t he discourse aspect s .

fe008 [ s^ co] : So , go ahead .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh [ disfm arker] oh , st at s kind of st at us , OK .
fe008 [ %−] : His [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh . Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] uh , I hav e uh , fiv e t hings t hat you can
circle ,
fe008 [ s^ 2^ t 1] : Cat egories .
m e011 [ s] : Undergrad , Grad , Post − doc , Professor , and t hen Ot her
, wit h a colon and a place where y ou can fill in if t here ’s som e Ot her .
m e011 [ s] : So I t hink t he problem wit h t hat is t hat t here ’s not a
necessarily easy equivalent for our v isit ors , who are [ pause] not used
t o t he [ pause] US educat ion levels .
m e011 [ s] : and [ pause] m ay need som e [ pause] help t o t ranslat e
what t hat m eans .
m e013 [ qw] : How fine a resolut ion do you need on t hat for t his ?
m n005 [ s^ 2] : Is t he quest ion .
m e013 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : I m ean [ pause] m aybe not so m uch .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : St udent , Non − st udent .
fe008 [ s^ nd] : Oh [ pause] I t hink undergrad [ pause] is useful .
fe016 [ qy ^ cs^ rt ] : Can you just writ e som et hing like " posit ion " ?
fe016 [ s^ cs^ e] : and people can fill in t heir own [ pause] you know , "
Post − doc " or [ pause] " visit or " or what ever .
m e013 [ s^ j] : P prone .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ e^ j] : Sit t ing .
m e011 [ s] : Well , t he problem wit h t hat is um , I t hink t he sam e as t he
problem of profession .
m n005 [ b.%] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e011 [ s^ df] : That it [ disfm arker] it will be [ disfm arker] t here will be a
t endency all [ disfm arker] for ev eryone t o put down " speech
researcher " or [ disfm arker] or som et hing at t hat granularit y .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : oh .
m e011 [ s] : So I don’t t hink t here ’s a problem asking t he educat ion
lev el , I t h At least I don’t feel like t here is .
m e011 [ qo] : um I t hink t he only quest ion is whet her t he [ disfm arker]
what cat egories should t here be .
fe008 [ b.%] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I t hink t hat [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : so Uh [ disfm arker] did [ disfm arker] are [ disfm arker]
were y ou suggest ing t hat it should be m ore fine grained t han t his ?
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No , no .
m e013 [ s^ e] : Less .
m e011 [ s] : Less .
fe008 [ qy ^ bu^ m ^ rt ] : Less ?
fe008 [ qw] : What would you suggest as a [ disfm arker] as a change ?

m e013 [ h|qy ^ rt .%−−] : Um , Hm m um well , do you t hink t here ’s
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bd^ no] : I don’t really know .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : I m ean , were you t hinking , uh , t hat it would be
useful for som e research lat er t o know say , you said undergrad for
inst ance , so , undergrad versus grad ,
fe008 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : Mm − hm m . Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy^ g^ rt ] : do you t hink t hat ’s im port ant ?
fe008 [ s^ df] : I do , and t he reason is because I t hink t hat um , well
having been a grad [ pause] st udent as , yeah , a as ot hers here , at
[ disfm arker] at Berkeley , t hat , um , I t hink t here ’s alm ost like a
quant um leap from undergrad t o grad in t erm s of like t he st at us .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ e] : I m ean , I m ean you not ice it in various ways , like sim ply
[ pause] t rying t o m eet wit h a professor during office hours .
fe008 [ s] : You know , in [ disfm arker] in m y depart m ent it was always
t he case grad st udent s had a huge [ pause] am ount of different
priorit y ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : and were t reat ed as equals , g and [ disfm arker] and
help helpers , y ou know , in [ disfm arker] in research , uh uh c uh
[ pause] roles and t hings t hat t hey [ disfm arker] t hat t hey [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : In t erm s of like t he s t he social dynam ics of int eract ions , I
would ex pect t hem t o be less deferent .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : and [ pause] um m aybe [ pause] less assert ive of t heir own
v iews and t hings like t hat .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
fe008 [ s] : I don’t [ pause] t hink t hat we ’re going t o have a lot of
undergrads ,
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ df.%−−] : unless we [ pause] branch out t o different t ypes of
m eet ings , but [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw^ cs:qw] : How about [ disfm arker] You could say , if you ’re
giv ing a t alk , how likely are you t o be challenged ?
fe008 [ s] : This is t he dim ension .
fe008 [ s^ r] : Well , t his is t he dim ension .
m e011 [ s] : Well , one of t he [ disfm arker] one of t he crit eria I had for
designing t his form , is t hat I didn’t want a separat e inst ruct ion sheet .
fe008 [ s^ aap] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker] One [ disfm arker] one
dim ension .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : And so we ’ll get t o t hat in a m om ent when we t alk about
language also .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e011 [ s] : Is I did not want t o hav e t o , you know com e down and quiz
each person and have a uh social dynam ics expert being t he one who
’s filling out t he answers .
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : I want it t o be self − ev aluat ing .
m e011 [ s] : You can give it t o t hem and t hey can underst and what you
’re asking .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : And it ’s non − t hreat ening ,
fe008 [ s^ e.%−] : I m ean , t his [ disfm arker] t his com pared t o , you know
, wh ex act ly what level of professorship , and [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
and [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e018 [ s^ ng] : Well , sounds like you really need t o know som et hing
kind of like t hat .
m e018 [ s:qw] : You need t o know sort of [ v ocalsound] Bas − in in t his
m eet ing , sort of what is your social st at us ?
m e011 [ s^ nd] : That ’s a separat e quest ion .
m e011 [ s^ cc] : So , we ’ll [ disfm arker] We ’ll get t o t hat in a m om ent .
fe008 [ s^ df^ nd] : Well , I agree wit h him , t hough .
fe008 [ %−−] : I [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : But I [ disfm arker] I agree t hat t his is t hat w t he rea t he
m ot ivat ion was t hings t hat could affect social dynam ics in ways t hat
are relev ant t o t he research wit hout being t hreat ening t o t he person .
m e018 [ s^ arp.%−] : But [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] but it ’s gonna
depend on who ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.%−] : And t his part icular form [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : I know .
m e011 [ s] : So , t his part icular form is speaker [ disfm arker] is
dependent only on t he speaker ,
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : not on t he m eet ing .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : You could im agine t hen hav ing anot her form [ vocalsound]
t hat y ou m ight want t o do during a m eet ing t o get out t he
relat ionships [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ df] : But t hen t hat ’s int erfering wit h t he m eet ing .
m e011 [ s] : So , what I like about t his inform at ion is you give it t o t hem
once , and t hey fill it out once ,
m e011 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and t hen you have t hat inform at ion .
fe008 [ s] : well , and we [ disfm arker] also discussed t he idea of having
t he separat e D T Ds would handle m aybe , s specific [ disfm arker]
m eet ing − specific t hings t hat m ight be relevant .
m e018 [ %−] : I g

m e013 [ %−] : I
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d^ m ^ rt ] : DTD ?
fe008 [ s.%−−] : uh , t he dat a , so t hat ,
fe008 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : y ou know , his XML t hing ?
fe008 [ s] : You got t he Dat a Ty pe Definit ion [ disfm arker] t he Docum ent
Ty pe Definit ion p part t hat it ’s [ disfm arker] can s be used for relat ional

m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n005 [ b.%] : Ah . Yeah .
m n005 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s.%] : DTD .
fe008 [ b] : y eah .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : I guess [ disfm arker] I guess it seem s t o m e like you
know I [ disfm arker] t rying t o deduce inform at ion about t he person ’s
st at us from t he m eet ing independent form [ pause] will be useless
because [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−] : See
m e011 [ s^ ar] : Not at all .
m e011 [ s^ df] : I m ean , t he fact t hat one person ’s an undergrad and
t he ot her ’s a full professor is int erest ing .
m e011 [ qh.%−] : So , t he quest ion is how m uch of t his inform at ion um ,
can y
m e018 [ s^ df^ nd] : But , t hat will depend on what t he m eet ing ’s about
,
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e011 [ s^ aa^ fe] : Well , absolut ely !
m e018 [ s.%−−] : Let ’s say t he undergrad was an expert in physics , and
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but you want t o have t hat inform at ion .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e011 [ qh] : So , if you don’t have t hat inform at ion , how are you
gonna do anyt hing ?
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ qh] : I guess I ’m wondering how can you m ake a conclusion
based on t hat , if you don’t know about t he m eet ing ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : y eah
fe008 [ s] : Where ’d [ disfm arker] This is just [ disfm arker] Well , you
know , we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re t alking at [ disfm arker] at a general
lev el of descript ion .
m e013 [ b] : yeah
fe008 [ s] : You can always get m ore specific .
fe008 [ %−] : And , it m ay be [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qw^ rt ] : I m ean , so what would you suggest ?
m e018 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .

m e018 [ s.%−] : I ’m just [ disfm arker] That ’s why I was [ pause]
wondering about if y ou can put som et hing about t he d
m e013 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ qy ^ rt ] : Can you repeat t he cat egories you had ?
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ df] : Maybe t hey ’re fine .
m e011 [ s] : Undergrad , Grad , Post − doc , Professor , Ot her
fe016 [ s^ aa|s^ arp.%−−] : So t hat , y eah , I t hink t hat ’s fine except t he
one [ pause] t hing is t here are a lot of ICSI v
fe016 [ s^ no] : like I don’t know what I would be here ,
fe016 [ s] : just I ’m not a professor
fe016 [ s.%−] : I ’m not a [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : So [ disfm arker] so anyt hing t hat , like a Visit or r ICSI
Visit or or , ICSI y
m e011 [ s^ bk] : oh , t hat ’s right ,
m e011 [ s.%−] : you know I was say ing " Professor " .
fe016 [ s] : I m ean a Visit ing S Researcher or what ever .
m e011 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah , when I said " Professor " , I guess what I was
t hinking in m y m ind was m ore " PHD but not Post − doc " .
m e013 [ qr] : How about [ disfm arker] Yeah , how about Post − PHD
researcher or som et hing
fe016 [ s^ cs.%−] : So if [ disfm arker] if we can put som et hing
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy^ cs^ d^ rt ] : and [ disfm arker] Or m aybe Post − doc [ pause]
change " Post − doc " t o " PHD " ?
fe016 [ s^ ba] : Yeah , t hat [ disfm arker] t hen [ disfm arker] t hen I t hink
what y ou have is great .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
fe016 [ s.%−] : for [ disfm arker] for t hat purpose and [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ qy ^ rt ] : So , change [ disfm arker] Would we change " Post − doc
" t o [ pause] " Post − PHD Researcher " ?
fe016 [ %−] : or just [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ cs.%−] : You could say [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ df] : Because I t hink PHD and Professor are d are dist inct
m n005 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e011 [ qy ^ g^ rt ] : aren’t t hey ?
m e013 [ b^ rt ] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ co|qw] : Wait , what ’s a PHD ?
m n005 [ s] : It ’s possible .
fe016 [ s^ df] : Like , if you have a PHD and you ’re [ pause] hanging
around here , and you ’re not a professor and you ’re not a post − doc ,
t hen t hat ’s like what we are [ vocalsound] so There ’s a bunch of
people like t hat .
m e011 [ s^ j] : Som eone who has a PHD .

m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah so for [ disfm arker] for m e t here ’s [ disfm arker]
t here ’s a [ disfm arker] There are people [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Um , t his got very t ricky in fact when we got involved wit h
t he Spanish program act ually
m e013 [ s] : because [ pause] uh , when we said , in our original form s ,
" post − doc " what we were used t o , from t he Germ an program and
from t he US st andard , when you say " post − doc " it m eant som ebody
who had just got t en a PHD who was doing one year som eplace .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : But when we did t he Spanish call , m any people said "
oh I want t o be uh [ disfm arker] have a post − doc slot " and t hey were
t went y y ears out
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : because t hey were " post " t heir [ pause] " doc "
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : So , y ou can say Post − PHD Researcher or what if t here ’s
one m ore cat egory t hat ’s sort of general like t hat .
m e013 [ fh] : so
m n005 [ b] : Yeah . Sure .
m e013 [ s.%−] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : It m ight be hard t o do a finer t hing t han t hat because
whet her som ebody is going t o be dom inant in a m eet ing is really I t hink
it ’s going t o be so clouded by ev eryt hing else [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : Som eone who ’s just got t en t heir PHD uh , could be
v ery v ery uh , st rongly opinionat ed about som et hing and som ebody
who ’s been t went y y ears out could be shy , you know , s
m e011 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So , m ay be Undergrad , Grad , Post − PHD and
Ot her ?
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : That ’s t rue .
m e013 [ qw] : What ’s [ pause] " Ot her " ?
m e011 [ s.%−] : um , ot her [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : For t he European [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : It ’s just t o allow .
m e011 [ qy^ bu^ d] : If i Inst ead of [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] inst ead of
[ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] inst ead of Professor or inst ead of Post − doc ?
fe016 [ s^ cs] : You − I t hink you could keep Professor , but you could
say Post PHD Researcher or som et hing .

m n005 [ b] : Yep .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : It could be st It could be [ disfm arker] That ’s t rue .
fe016 [ s^ ar|s^ cs] : No , inst ead of Post [ disfm arker] Post − doc or Post
− PHD , just wrap all t he people t hat are post PHD and non − professors
t oget her .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : so you want Professor t o be in a separat e cat egory ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : y ou t hink [ disfm arker] you t hink uh [ disfm arker] t hink
[ disfm arker] t hink we [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.%−] : So , as I said Undergrad [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : I t hink professors probably want it
fe016 [ s] : I don’t [ vocalsound] care .
m e011 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Undergrad , Grad , Post − PHD , Professor ,
Ot her ?
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : Well , yeah t he Post − PHD one is t he one t hat can be , like
Post − Post − doc or Post − PHD Researcher or what ever .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ ba^ rt ] : Then it ’d be fine .
fe016 [ s^ r^ t 1] : I t hink it ’s fine .
m e013 [ fg|s] : So , I ’m t e I ’m t ending t o push t oward sim pler
m e013 [ s^ df] : even t hough I know t hat m ore det ailed m eans m ore
[ pause] pot ent ial inform at ion for som eone lat er who ’s doing research
[ pause] in [ disfm arker] in t his area
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] The [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t he t hing [ pause] m aking m e lean t oward sim pler where
possible is t hat uh [ pause] t he m ore a t hing [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Many of t he m eet ings t hat we record uh , m ay be t he kind
where we just record som ebody once
m e013 [ s^ df] : even t hough [ pause] we want t o get a lot of dat a t hat
has uh , m any m eet ings wit h t he sam e people .
m e013 [ s^ bs] : And so t he m ore form s we have and t he m ore lines in
t he form s t hat ’s t h t he m ore overhead for t hat one t im e t hing m akes
it harder t o do .
m e011 [ s^ ng] : Well , t he whole reason t hat I ’m doing it t his way is
[ disfm arker] is uh [ disfm arker] m y experience so far has been t he
ex act rev erse .
m e011 [ s^ df.%−] : That [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ aap] : Right . [ pause] That ’s what we ’ve done so far .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : And so I ’m saying I expect us t o do bot h kinds .
m e011 [ s] : I guess we could hav e anot her t ype of form [ pause] for
less frequent .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .

fe008 [ qy ^ d] : Well , one t hing , so you underst and he [ disfm arker] he
d he want s y ou t o do t his only once for each person ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK , OK .
m e013 [ s] : So I ’m saying t here are going t o be [ disfm arker] What I
im agine once we ’ve collect ed a lot of dat a , a chunk of it will be uh ,
t he sam e people m any t im es
fe008 [ %] : So .
m e013 [ s] : and anot her chunk of it will be people [ disfm arker] random
m eet ings t hat we got wit h from different people
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : and I t hink it ’s use We ’ve t alked about t his before , it ’s
useful t o hav e bot h kinds of dat a . I t hink .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : Well I t hink t hat if [ disfm arker] if we ’re planning t o do
t hat , t hen we should probably have anot her set of form s .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ e] : You know , a single form t hat ’s t he consent form and
t he speaker inform at ion form and not have t hem do digit s .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : No , I like t he idea of put t ing down t he [ disfm arker] t he
st at us inform at ion
m e018 [ s^ df] : because I t hink y ou probably can get a lot of int erest
t here can be a lot of int erest ing research on t hat .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ qy^ d.%−] : I ’m wondering could we add som et hing t o t he form
t hat get s filled out at each m eet ing t hat would som ehow [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ t ] : This is a t opic I want t o bring up [ pause] aft er I get
t hrough t his .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : So , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s anot her
form t hat I want t o discuss . um , wit h t he digit s form s .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ f] : Well [ disfm arker] I guess I was t hinking m aybe , you
know how you were t aking inform at ion off of t he digit s and put t ing it
ont o t hat ?
m e011 [ %−] : So , s can we get [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ qy ] : Could we put one m ore t hing on here m aybe ?
m e011 [ s.%−−] : That ’s what I want t o t alk about in a [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , I ’m [ disfm arker] I have t hat as a t opic , also .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m e011 [ s^ co^ t ] : So , let ’s finish wit h t he speaker form [ disfm arker]
speaker form and t hen we ’ll get over [ pause] o get over t o t hat one .
m e018 [ s^ df.%−] : Cuz you said separat e form s so I t hought m aybe
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ t ] : So , Educat ion Level , Undergrad , Grad , Post − PHD ,
Professor , Ot her .
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ f^ rt ] : OK ?
m n005 [ s^ aa^ m ] : OK .
m e011 [ fh|s] : um and t hen I put " Opt ional " wit h a big " Opt ional " in
parent heses , Age .
fe016 [ qw^ rt ] : Wait , why is t hat opt ional ?
m e011 [ s] : Because I t hink a lot of people are sensit ive t o it and won’t

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So I don’t want t o m ake t hem feel like t hey have t o .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
fe016 [ s^ ng] : It [ disfm arker] it would be very good t o get age for a lot
of purposes .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ df.%−−] : I m ean a lot of corpora [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ df^ nd:s] : Uh , sure . But if som eone doesn’t want t o
writ e it down I don’t want t hem t o say you can’t record m e [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fg|qo^ rt ] : yeah , so we ca we have t hese age ranges or
som et hing ?
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , right .
fe008 [ %−] : Well it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ co] : Well , wait [ disfm arker] wait [ disfm arker] wait

m e013 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : I suggest you ask for t heir age
m e013 [ s^ co^ e] : and if t hey say I don’t want t o give it say OK .
fe008 [ s] : In [ disfm arker] in like t he London − Lund [ com m ent ] t hey

m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ qw.%−] : How about [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ df.%−] : It ’s [ disfm arker] you know his " Opt ional " is not really

m e018 [ qw:s] : How about " opt ional but highly desirable " ?
fe008 [ s^ fe^ j] : Please , please !
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : Age or Approxim at e Age .

fe016 [ fg|s] : Anyway , it ’s fine
fe016 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .

t he form .
m e011 [ s] : Well I didn’t m ark any t hing else as specifically opt ional ,
fe016 [ s^ bs] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he only opt ional t hing ,
fe008 [ s^ t 1.%] : Let ’s see .
fe008 [ s] : That ’s t he only ot her one .
fe008 [ s^ r] : That ’s t he only one .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m e011 [ fg|s] : Yep . Jane and I discussed t his , and it was [ disfm arker]
it was again t he sam e problem
m e011 [ s] : t hat [ pause] it ’s gonna be a self − evaluat ion anyway ,
m e011 [ s:s] : and so I don’t want t o have t o be st anding over t he

Am erican when you were t wo , and t hen it changed t o [ disfm arker] "
and so on .
fe008 [ s] : Well also , you [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker] you
[ disfm arker] he has a sep separat e subject for Region .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh
fe008 [ s] : and so it ’s a self − assessm ent of what you t hink your

fe008 [ s] : And t hen following t hat , a charact erizat ion of [ disfm arker]
of region .
fe008 [ s] : Now , we discussed m aybe indicat ing a t a t im e fram e .
fe008 [ s^ e:qw] : So , " Where did you live during your , [ pause] you

m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−] : which would be [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ 2:s] : Which is m ore object iv e . t han som ebody evalu saying

fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes . Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : Alt hough y ou know I m ean a lot of people t here won’t be , e
m uch difference ,
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , [ pause] t h t here ’s room on t he form t o put al a a

m e013 [ qy .%−] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I ’m sorry , so you ’re

fe008 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qw^ br.%−−:qw.%−−] : t hat you ’re saying , uh what is your
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : So t he [ disfm arker] t he [ pause] for [ pause] t he non − na
for t he nat iv e English speakers we have Variet y of English and Region .

m e013 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : And t hat ’s it .
fe008 [ s.%−] : And t hat ’s part ly t o pick up [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : And t hen [ pause] we hav e anot her form lat er down which
is um , list ot her language influences .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : S Mm − hm m
fe016 [ qw^ rt ] : So what does Region m ean
m e018 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , I was just gonna ask t he sam e t hing .
fe016 [ s] : and like if I see t his form I wouldn’t be quit e sure what you
m ean by [ pause] Region .
m e018 [ %−] : Region [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ na] : Right , neit her would I .
fe016 [ qr.%−−] : Do you want t o have [ disfm arker] give choices and
have t hem circle one , or ,
fe016 [ %−] : I m ean
fe008 [ s] : Well , we [ disfm arker] When we [ disfm arker] when we
discussed it it was [ disfm arker] it was where [ disfm arker] where you
liv ed during y our childhood and adolescence .
m e011 [ s.%−] : Um , [ pause] I don’t t hink we can do t hat because it
would be different for [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy .%−] : Does t hat m ean region of [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qr.%−−] : Region of t he US , or region of t he world [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : If you ’re Am erican English it would be region of t he US .
fe008 [ s] : Well [ disfm arker] It ’s [ disfm arker] W it ’s where you lived .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : That [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] so t hat ’s why I didn’t
have circle form s .
fe016 [ s.%−] : but I m ean .
m e011 [ s] : Because it would be different depending on what your
language is .
m e011 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qr^ rt ] : Do you m ean st at e , [ nonvocalsound] or do you m ean
m ore broad t han t he st at e level ?
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ qr^ bu^ d.%−] : You m ean like you know sout hern US , or
nort heast ern or
m e011 [ s] : It − I t hink it would be however you would ident ify your own .
m e011 [ s] : And , as I said I don’t really see a way of doing a circle fill in
, because t here would be [ disfm arker] t here would have t o be one for
Am erican English , one for Brit ish English , one for you know , one for
each t y pe .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : If y ou want ed t o get regions for Am erican English you

fe008 [ fg] : Well , and also [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ s^ e] : They had divided t hings up int o regions .
m e011 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but [ pause] t hat would m ean I would have
t o do [ disfm arker] generat e a different form for circles , if you ’re
Am erican English or Brit ish English or Indian English .
m e018 [ s^ ar] : No , no .
m e018 [ s] : It would only be f if y ou said Am erican English
fe016 [ s^ aa|s^ df] : yeah m aybe not for t he ot hers , because t here
aren’t going t o be enough people t o really group t hem
m e018 [ s] : t hen you ’d put t he regions .
m e018 [ s] : For t he ot hers , you would just leave it .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bs] : We wouldn’t have enough t o really m ake t hem

fe016 [ s.%−−] : and you know when y ou t alk about dialect s in England , I

m e018 [ s] : Very [ disfm arker] just a lim it ed num ber
fe008 [ b.%] : OK .
m e018 [ s.%−] : and t hen if you ’re Am erican you would just circle t he

fe008 [ %−] : Well [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s right .
fe008 [ s] : Well t hat [ disfm arker] you know t hat was t he concept of
having t he region t hing ,

fe008 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] It would be no problem t o change it t o opt ions
if um [ disfm arker] if t hat were desirable .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , I just don’t know what t o do about t he ot her
v ariet ies of English .
fe008 [ s.%−] : Alt hough for different
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Well , t hat ’s t rue .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : You ’d just leave t hem .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , Indian English I wouldn’t know f
m e018 [ s] : You don’t even ask .
fe016 [ s^ df] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] t here are huge differences
y ou know in t he ot hers
fe008 [ qw.%−] : what
m e011 [ s] : Well , t hat ’s why I want ed t o just leave it som et hing t hat
y ou could writ e it down .
fe016 [ s^ cs.%−−] : so it m ight be bet t er t o just do it for t he
fe016 [ s^ cs] : yeah you could leave region for [ disfm arker] for t he
ot hers but hav e [ pause] circled choice for t he Am erican [ pause]
English .
m e018 [ s.%−−:s.%−−] : One [ disfm arker] one good reason t o use t he
TIMIT ones is if any body asks y ou y ou know , about t he dat a lat er on
y ou can say " well I chose t hese based on TIMIT " , And [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That is kind of nice .
m e013 [ %−] : What [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qo] : what about just doing t he [ disfm arker] t he sort of t he
St ev e suggest ion , uh , as [ disfm arker] as an add − on t o it ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ s^ cs:qw] : Rat her t han saying Region , [ vocalsound] just say "
Where did you liv e bet ween t he ages of here and here ? "
fe008 [ s] : That was t he concept of region .
m e018 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : And t hat would apply t o everybody t hen ?
m e018 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−] : Just [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] It ’s just t he wording of it .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : And t hen you could m ap t hose t o t he TIMIT regions
lat er , if people want ed t o .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−] : And t hen t hey [ disfm arker] t hey could s
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ cs] : Right [ disfm arker] yeah , t hey could say it
different way s .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : That ’s m ore general .
m e013 [ s^ e.%−−] : They could say Cincinnat i or t hey could say Midwest
or [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .

m e018 [ s^ aa] : That ’s t rue .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Act ually t hat is t rue for t hem
fe016 [ s^ arp^ df] : but it m eans t hat you ’re gonna get a bunch of
different lev el [ disfm arker] lev els of resolut ion in your survey , it
[ disfm arker] it ’ll be m ore of a pain lat er ,
fe016 [ fh] : so .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Som ebody ’s gonna have t o do som e dat a [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Well , t here could be a circle one .
fe016 [ s] : It [ pause] depends .
fe008 [ s.%−] : I guess t here ’s a
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e011 [ s^ cs:qw] : So , you could say [ pause] " What region did you
grow up in from t hese years ? "
m e011 [ s.%−] : and have a set of circ of six or seven circles
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : Yeah , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s good
fe016 [ s^ df.%−−] : but if you [ disfm arker] have it t ot ally free − form First
of all som e people t ake [ disfm arker] y ou
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy^ 2^ bu^ d^ rt ] : A lot of post − processing .
fe016 [ s^ ng] : Well , and som e people would give you m ore specific
inform at ion t han ot hers
fe016 [ s^ df^ ng] : and t hat ’s a wast e because you can only use t he
least com m on denom inat or of specificit y and generally .
m e013 [ s^ bu^ nd] : Yeah but t hat [ disfm arker] but t he good t hing
about it is it [ disfm arker] is it frees you from com ing up wit h exact ly
what t he right cat egories are .
m e013 [ h|qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : um , Right ?
fe016 [ s^ no^ rt ] : I don’t know
fe016 [ s] : lat er on , if [ disfm arker] if som ebody just says Midwest , now
all t hese ot her people who said you know area t hen t hat ’ll have t o
becom e y our cat egory .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : and it ’s [ disfm arker] It ’s harder lat er on , i I [ disfm arker] It
’s easier for t he person
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
fe008 [ s] : There is anot her problem .
fe016 [ s.%−] : but it ’s harder for t he r
fe016 [ s] : it act ually less inform at ive for us
fe016 [ s^ df] : because you can’t enforce any m inim um level of
specificit y .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But I t hink t hat if y ou ’re going t o have it be general uh
,
fe016 [ %−] : so it ’s [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s.%−−] : so t he idea again was , you know , you m ight wanna
also know if [ disfm arker] if t hey grew up in Germ any or if t hey grew up
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and so [ pause] uh , I t hink [ pause] you wanna
[ disfm arker] The idea [ disfm arker] t he m ot ivat ion I t hink for t his being
suggest ed before was t hat it did cover a range of t hese cases t hat
m ight um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : y ou know , if you say your nat ive language was
[ disfm arker] was English but uh [ pause] y ou [ pause] you grew up in
Germ any , uh I t hink t his [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fg|s] : Yeah , y t here is act u [ disfm arker] you m ade m e t hink
about anot her wrinkle in t his whole t hing , which is t hat [ pause] just
asking t hem where t hey grew up bet ween cert ain ages isn’t enough ,
m e018 [ s^ df] : because som ebody could grow up in Germ any but live
on an arm y base speaking English .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ e^ na] : Or som eone could in Geor − in [ disfm arker] in New
York and hav e , I m ean , any num ber of different t ypes of [ pause]
speech pat t erns .
fe016 [ s^ e.%−] : Or t heir parent s live [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : yeah .
m e018 [ fg|s^ cs.%−−:qw.%−−] : Yeah , so you sort of have t o say what
languages were spoken in t he hom e bet ween t he ages of [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ r.%−] : and t heir parent s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well , we have t his [ disfm arker] We haft a [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : So . He hasn’t given y ou t he overview ,
fe008 [ s] : but you have , like , t he Nat ive Speaker cat egory , t he Non −
nat iv e Speaker [ pause] cat egory ,
fe008 [ s] : and t hen you have Ot her Language Influences , for exam ple
bilingual dialect s , t h t hings like t hat .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh t hat ’s nice , OK .
fe008 [ s] : Now t here ’s t his issue of not wa like you ’re saying , you
don’t want t he form s t o be hugely com plicat ed and t ake half t he
m eet ing t o com plet e .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : So , it ’s t rying t o [ disfm arker] e t here ’s t his [ disfm arker]
t ry ing t o [ disfm arker] t rying t o hold t his balance bet ween t he am ount
of inform at ion needed
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : and uh , you know , not t aking t oo m uch m eet ing t im e ,
fe008 [ s] : and t hen in addit ion , add t o it t he t hird level of t he balance
, uh , um t his [ disfm arker] t his issue of not being t oo int rusive , asking
in a way t hat t hey don’t m ind .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ qh] : If we release t his corpus , what do we want ,

fe016 [ s] : I m ean if you do t his free form um [ pause] t he free form
solut ion where som e quest ions are very open − ended t hen you need
[ disfm arker] som eone needs t o ent er t hat ,
fe016 [ s] : and t hey ’ll be not es and it will be very difficult for som ebody
lat er act ually use t hat wit hout m apping it .
fe008 [ s^ ng] : Well , I t hink rea I t hink t hat we need t o rem em ber t hat
we have [ disfm arker] First of all , it ’s not all free form .
fe016 [ s^ ba^ df^ rt ] : It ’s OK .
fe016 [ s^ arp.%−] : But it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ df] : We hav e several [ pause] cat egories t hat are specifically
const rained ,
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ df] : And in t erm s of t he [ pause] m ore open ones , we have
t he [ disfm arker] we ’re in t he env iable posit ion of having t he cont act
inform at ion and also knowing m ost of t he people who will be
part icipat ing in t he m eet ing dat a .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : We can find it [ disfm arker] We can resolve cert ain
issues lat er , if [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk|qh] : Yeah , and t he quest ion is how ext ensive t his get s .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , I guess what you really want , is if t here ’s som e
inform at ion you wanna know [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : So we want som e rough idea of t heir dialect , basically .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : That ’s it .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : t hen we should have som e quest ion where it ’s not free
form , ex cept for t hese people who are who have non − Am erican
English accent s .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : There we probably hav e t o have a cat egory " Non −
Am erican English " and t hen a few choices .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : And we should have som et hing t hat ’s sim ple , t hat
people can circle , like t hese TIMIT regions or som et hing , so t hat we
have som et hing t hat m inim ally you can [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : cuz a lot of t im es if you give t he dat a out t hat ’s what
people are gonna use .
fe016 [ s] : They ’re gonna want som e sm all set of places ,
fe016 [ s^ cs] : and t hen , but anyt hing addit ional people can fill out ,
and we can put it in as a not e or som et hing ,
fe016 [ s:s] : but if we don’t hav e t hat , som eone ’s got t a sit t here and
figure out you know , I ’ve got t went y people who said Midwest ,
fe016 [ s:s] : and I ’ve got a few people who said som et hing else
fe016 [ s.%−] : and t hese don’t overlap or t hese
fe008 [ s] : Well − Isn’t it [ disfm arker] I m ean , I t hink [ pause] t hat
[ pause] we ’re going a lit t le bit in a circle , because I like t he TIMIT
suggest ion very m uch ,
fe008 [ s] : and I t hink it ’s a quest ion of how t o ge incorporat e it ,

fe008 [ s^ cs] : and [ disfm arker] and we ’ve already suggest ed
[ disfm arker] I m ean , it ’s com e up in t his discussion , t hat [ disfm arker]
t he suggest ion t hat we could hav e [ pause] um t he TIMIT cat egories for
t he Am erican ,
fe008 [ s^ cs] : and [ disfm arker] and t hen m ake t he choice [ pause] or
not , as t o whet her we do it for Brit ish ,
fe016 [ s^ bk|fg.%−] : Oh , OK , so [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : y eah as long as you have [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I m ean , w we sort of discussed one way or t he ot her ,
fe008 [ s] : and it doesn’t m at t er t o m e .
fe008 [ s] : I don’t know if [ pause] Adam has [ disfm arker] has a
preference ,
m e013 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : but we could have [ pause] you know , a sub a sub −
cat egorizat ion for Am erican ,
fe008 [ s] : We could even use t he TIMIT subcat egorizat ion .
fe008 [ s^ no] : I don’t know if it has one for Brit ish , or what ever ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : But y ou know , just have it [ disfm arker] you know , a short
sim ple form t hat you can cat egorize yourself in a [ disfm arker] in a
sy st em at ic way .
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : What about t he [ disfm arker] t he phrasing t hat um
Chuck used , uh [ pause] which was in [ disfm arker] in relat ion t o t he
quest ion I was t rying t o form ulat e of uh Where [ disfm arker] where did
y ou [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : what was t hat [ disfm arker] what w how did you phrase
it ?
m e011 [ s:qw] : What language was spoken in t he hom e ?
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m .%−−:qw.%−−] : " What language was spok " ,
m e013 [ qo^ rt ^ rt ] : yeah , so it ’s not where did you grow up , but what
language was spoken in t he hom e bet ween t he ages of , what would it
be , fiv e and t welv e or som et hing like t hat ?
m n005 [ b] : Mm m .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : It ’s a good idea .
m e011 [ s] : Depends of who you ask , what t he age range is .
fe016 [ s^ arp] : Well , in t he hom e , t he influence of t he hom e is m uch
lower age t han t hat ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ df^ e.%−] : I m ean once y ou go beyond t he age five or six
t hen it ’s t he [ disfm arker] t he school influence as well and [ pause] and
fe008 [ s^ e] : And t he peers .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : yeah ,
fe016 [ s] : so [ pause] In t he hom e it ’s sort of your phonet ic first level ,
fe008 [ s] : That ’s one part t hough .

fe016 [ s] : um [ pause] a − So it ’s [ disfm arker] you know it st art s t o get
sort of com plicat ed .
m e011 [ s.%−] : Yeah , so t his is why I [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ nd] : Well , [ disfm arker] It ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s not a
problem t hough ,
m e011 [ s.%−] : So [ disfm arker] so t h
fe008 [ s^ ba] : I m ean . That would be a good quest ion t o ask ,
fe008 [ s^ cs] : and t hen you could add a quest ion .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : You know , would [ disfm arker] uh " am ong your peers " .
fe008 [ s^ f] : You know .
m e013 [ s] : cuz he does m ake a good point about t he region
fe008 [ s^ e] : Specify t he age range .
m e013 [ s.%−] : not necessarily again , if you ’re on t he arm y base or
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : Well , t he way it ’s phrased right now , it ’s clearly asking
about language .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : And so , what it ’s t rying t o get at is what you t hink you
speak .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Now , I t hink t hat t he point is well t aken t hat
som et im es people are wrong about what t hey t hink t hey speak .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ nd] : But , ot her t han having a t rained linguist int erview
t hem [ pause] and ask t hese very specific quest ions , I don’t see a way
around it .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ df] : Because as you said , what you ’re gonna have t o st ay
[ disfm arker] say is " Well , list t he languages t hat your parent s spoke
when y ou were in hom e and how good t hey were at it and how long
t hey spoke it ,
m e011 [ s] : and now list t he ones in preschool
m e011 [ s] : and now list t he ones in first grade
m e011 [ s.%−−] : and now list t he ones your friends speak [ disfm arker] "
m e018 [ s] : Sort of like as soon as y ou get t o t he [ pause] cases on
t he edge , t he com plexit y just shoot s up .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , t hat ’s right .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ df] : So I want t o t ry t o keep t he com plexit y so som eone can
fill out t his form at t he beginning of a m eet ing wit hout t aking f uh fort y
− fiv e m inut es .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−] : and we ’re [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : and t hen we [ disfm arker] like I said , we have t he enviable
benefit of knowing m ost of t hese people .

fe008 [ s] : and being able t o ask t hem follow − ups if we need t o .
m e013 [ s^ aap] : For now ,
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right
m e013 [ s] : so it ’s [ disfm arker] I m ean , again , we are hoping t o
ex pand t his out ,
fe008 [ s^ bk^ m ] : For now .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : That ’s t rue .
fe008 [ s] : Washingt on and st uff , y eah .
m e013 [ b] : yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : That ’s t rue .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : So I t hink t hat adding t he [ disfm arker] t he TIMIT
cat egories is a good idea ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : because t hat ’s v ery easy for a person t o fill out .
m e011 [ qo^ df^ rt ] : But I t hink we st ill hav e t his problem of is it gonna
be a self − ev aluat ion ?
m e011 [ qrr.%−−] : or are we gonna ask t hem " what was it when you
were four years old , or what was it when you were six years old , or
what wher " w
m e011 [ qw] : What ’s t he best way of phrasing t he quest ion ?
m e018 [ fg|s] : Well , you know t he ot her t hing , t oo , is t hat it seem s
like t h one of t he reasons you would gat her real det ailed inform at ion
about t heir nat ive language is if you were gonna do fine − grained
phonet ic analy sis or som et hing .
m e018 [ s.%−] : and [ disfm arker] I don’t [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−] : Well , it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : And som ebody m ight .
m e011 [ s^ aap] : Or adapt a or adapt at ion .
fe016 [ s^ df^ nd] : Most of [ disfm arker] but m ost of t hose people don’t
rely on t he self − ev aluat ions , anyway .
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : Well t hat ’s what I was gonna ask ,
m e018 [ qy .%−] : is t hat [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : They ’ll probably list en t o t he speech ,
fe016 [ fh] : so
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well , I [ disfm arker] you know , I w I was t hinking of it as
[ disfm arker] e
fe008 [ s^ ba] : t hat ’s a good point ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : but I was t hinking uh , you know , wit h reference t o t he
[ pause] language m odel issue , which uh
fe008 [ s] : and I guess it could be done induct ively ,
fe008 [ s.%−] : but if y ou have a bunch of , say , R − less dialect s and uh
y ou know , if t hey [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : But even you know in Swit chboard , I [ disfm arker] I
rem em ber looking really carefully at [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : They have inform at ion sort of like TIMIT
fe016 [ s^ no] : I don’t know it ’s [ disfm arker] how well t hey cat egorized
,

fe016 [ s.%−−] : but t hey had Nort h At lant ic , Mid − At lant ic , and
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : You know , Texas was definit ely out on [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : I m ean m ost of t he people from cer cert ain places in t he
Sout h were from specific Texas locat ions ,
fe016 [ s.%−−] : but [ pause] ot her t han t hat you had a huge range of
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : You know , people would say Bost on , and t hey had not hing
like what I would call a Bost on accent .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s.%−] : So it was [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba^ t 1] : Int erest ing .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Were t hey put t ing down where t hey lived [ pause] at
t he m om ent t hey m recordings were m ade ?
m e018 [ qy ^ g^ rt ] : Is t hat why ?
fe016 [ h|s^ nd] : Um No , t he quest ion was really geared t owards t rying
t o get people ’s self − evaluat ion of t heir dialect region .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ e^ g^ rt ] : Rat her t han where t hey grew up ?
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
fe008 [ s] : But y ou have a lot of st rat ificat ion in [ disfm arker] any region
.
fe016 [ s.%−−] : and y ou know , for inst ance , you know , Minnesot a
Midwest is t ot ally different t han Michigan Midwest which is t ot ally
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ b] : Int erest ing .
fe016 [ s] : t hese were all set t led by very different [ pause] t ype people
,
fe016 [ s^ ba] : so it [ disfm arker] it ’s sort of a general help
fe016 [ s^ df] : but I t hink t hat anyone who ’s doing phonet ics wouldn’t
rely on t hat , t hey would probably use it as a first pass or som et hing ,
m e018 [ s^ bu^ cs] : So , t hen we probably don’t need t he fine − grained
inform at ion .
m e011 [ s.%−] : Well m aybe should we just [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : Then m aybe we shouldn’t [ disfm arker] just
shouldn’t ask .
fe016 [ s^ arp.%−−] : Well , I t hink we do need t o m ake sure about t he f
t he non − nat ive accent s because t hose are , you know [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ aap^ cs] : but we don’t need t o ha be really really specific
about t he ot hers , because it won’t be very w helpful anyway .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : Well , m aybe for t he nat iv e English speakers we
shouldn’t ev en ask t he region if it ’s t hat unreliable .

fe016 [ s^ nd] : I t hink we should , because ot her dat abases do .
fe016 [ s^ df] : It ’s sort of a polit ical t hing .
fe016 [ s^ ba.%−−] : And t here are som e general [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : like , y ou will find m ore New Yorkers in t he New York
cat egory .
fe016 [ s.%−] : but it ’s not
m e018 [ s^ 2] : It can’t be relied on only .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ t c] : The ot her t hing also is t hat I ’m asking for t he variet y of
English , and I did just put Am erican , Brit ish , Indian and ot her .
m e011 [ s] : So , I didn’t put Canadian , Aust ralian , and all t he ot her
v ariet ies .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e011 [ s] : Now , t he problem I have wit h t hat is I don’t know who
would be filling it out .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : Well , t hat I t hink , som eone int ernal t o t he m eet ing
could do aft er t he fact .
fe008 [ s] : And t his would [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and we
discussed t his ,
fe008 [ s] : t his is wit h reference t o like t he DTD ,

fe008 [ qh] : what you would put in t he DTD t hat ’s m eet ing − specific .
fe008 [ s^ cs^ e.%−−] : So . And it could be som et hing like , " oh by t he
way , t he guy giving t he present at ion t oday is t he st udent of t he
professor who you know ,
fe008 [ s] : what ev er " .
fe008 [ s^ e] : So , speaker A is his professor and t hey [ disfm arker] and
he ’s preparing for his quals or som e such t hing like t hat .
fe008 [ s^ e] : Or it could be you know , " so − and − so and so − and − so
are m arried " .
m n005 [ b] : Hm m .
m e011 [ s] : Just t o pick up an arbit rary an [ com m ent ] exam ple .
m n005 [ %−] : So − and − so and so [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : We [ disfm arker] t his wouldn’t be relevant all t he t im e
fe008 [ s.%−−] : but y ou know , if t here ’s a big discussion on [ pause]
y ou know , t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] um , best way t o m ove
house , t hen [ disfm arker] and t hese people are t alking a whole lot ,
t hen it m ight be int erest ing inform at ion t o say oh by t he way t hey ’re
m arried , or [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t m ean , uh , you know .
m e011 [ fg] : Right .
m e011 [ qw] : So t h so t he sort s of quest ions I had were one Who ’s
gonna fill it out , and who ’s gonna t ake responsibilit y for filling it out
[ pause] in each m eet ing ,
m e011 [ qy ] : I m ean , will we re will we require it .
fe008 [ s] : I would t end t o leave t hat e spont aneous ,
fe008 [ s] : I t hink t hat e at t he st age of uh Uh , sc scanning t he
[ pause] t ranscript s aft er t hey ’ve been produced by [ disfm arker] by
our [ disfm arker] [ pause] by IBM , At t hat point , I t hink t hat som e of
t hese dy nam ics will appear t o be im port ant ,
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : and you could [ disfm arker] you could spend a lot of t im e
enum erat ing all t he different relat ionships t hat people have .
m e011 [ qw] : And t hat was m y ot her quest ion , which is [ pause] um
[ pause] what sort of inform at ion do we want t o record ?
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , so I t hink pairwise relat ionships are pret t y easy .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : You know , source , dest inat ion , relat ion .
m e011 [ qy ] : Are t here ot her sort s of t hings t hat m ight [ disfm arker] we
m ight want t o record ?
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well , I ju I was just t hinking , wit h reference t o uh ,
t hings t hat hav e [ disfm arker] t hat bear on t he cont ent or t he st at us
relat ions , would be t he t hings [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : Wit hout being exhaust ive , by any m eans ,

fe008 [ s^ e.%−−] : but just like I said , if t here ’s a k a cert ain t opic t hat
com es up in t he m eet ing , and [ disfm arker] [ pause] t hat knowing t heir
relat ionship will clarify it , or [ pause] if t here ’s a cert ain dynam ic t hat
com es up [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ e] : So , I m ean , a person is asked a whole bunch of
quest ions , m ore t han you ’d usually t hink t hey ’d be asked ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : and it t urns out it ’s because he ’s being prepared for a
job int erview or som et hing like t hat , t hen it ’s useful t o know t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat relat ionship .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : I t hink t hat fit s in well wit h t he whole m eet ing m ap
[ disfm arker] m apping m eet ings concept is t hat ’s anot her way of
looking at [ disfm arker] looking at it .
fe008 [ s^ r] : But , not t o be exhaust ive .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Int erest ing .
m e011 [ qy ] : So , are t here anyt hing ot her t han pairwise ?
fe008 [ s^ aa^ rt |s.%−] : Oh , well yeah , you could have people who are
all part of t he sam e foot ball league , or [ disfm arker] uh or chess club ,
or [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh yeah , OK .
fe016 [ qy ^ rt ] : So t hi Isn’t t his an open − ended , like basically a not es
colum n ?
fe016 [ s.%−] : I m ean you can im agine want ing you should be able
always t o at t ach som e not es t o [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yes , shirt [ disfm arker] cert ainly .
fe016 [ qr] : is t his t he [ disfm arker] t he place where we would do t hat ,
or is t here anot her place .
m e011 [ s] : I ’ve been t hi I [ disfm arker] it seem s t o be t hat t here is
[ disfm arker] We could at t ach m ore st ruct ure if we want ed t o .
m e011 [ s] : Especially because a lot of t hese relat ionships are
pairwise power relat ionships .
m e013 [ s] : I May be I was m issing som et hing m aybe ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : but I m ean [ pause] t his is som et hing one would t ry t o
infer ,
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : but how do [ disfm arker] how would you How would
y ou freeze t hat inform at ion about what , uh ,
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , we already have t hese t hings about som eone ’s a
professor and som eone ’s a st udent , or som et hing ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but would you [ disfm arker] would you [ disfm arker]
Som e person would be writ ing OK t his person was leading t he m eet ing
and t hat was or [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qr.%−−] : is t hat what you m ean , or [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw.%−] : What [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker]
uh ,

m e011 [ s] : Um , just as an exam ple , it would be , " Source , Adam
Janin " , " Dest inat ion , Morgan " , " Relat ionship , Advisor " .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ bu.%−] : Oh , so y ou ’re just put t ing preexist ing
relat ionships t hat are
m e011 [ s^ 2] : t hat are relevant .
fe016 [ s] : I t hink t hat st art s t o [ disfm arker] There ’s definit ely som e
clear cases ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
fe016 [ s] : but t here are a lot of gray areas , where [ pause] t he
cont ext happens just in t hat m eet ing ,
m e013 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
m e011 [ s^ aa.%] : Yep .
fe016 [ %−−] : or ,
fe016 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , where you don’t wanna sort of have t o m ake a
dist inct ion bet ween a pre − exist ing relat ionship , or
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah , I m
fe008 [ s] : Well , realize , w t his was [ disfm arker] t he idea was t hat t his
would be m eet ing specific .
fe008 [ s] : Ot herwise , t hey would [ disfm arker] it would be possible t o
have a higher lev el t hing .
fe016 [ s^ df] : But I m ean , t here are som e t hat generalize over m any
m eet ings and t here are som e t hat don’t , and t here are som e t hings
t hat happen in bet ween m eet ings ,
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ nd.%−] : Right , but t hat exam ple was not [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ aa] : That ’s t rue . That ’s t rue .
m e011 [ fg|s^ bd^ na.%−] : Right , so m y ex am ple was not a good one ,
because t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s] : So , I m ean , for [ disfm arker] t oday , for inst ance ,
fe016 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : t his is t he second m eet ing recorded t oday .
m e013 [ s] : The first m eet ing was a [ disfm arker] was a front − end
m eet ing ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : and in t hat one , t he basic form of t hat was uh , I was
t he leader ,
m e013 [ s:qw] : and I was saying uh , " what are t he result s you ’ve
got t en in t he last week ? "
m e013 [ s] : And t hey were [ disfm arker] and uh one person was sort of
t aking t he lead , in describing what t he result s were ,
m e013 [ s:qw] : and t hen uh , Chuck was t aking t he role of saying , "
well , what did y ou m ean by t hat ? " ,
m e013 [ s] : so he was sort of like t he out s sem i − out sider , asking
curiosit y quest ions .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen it would com e back t o m e wit h saying " well , you
know , y ou showed m e t hat but you know , I t hink you should do t his in
t he fut ure , "

m e013 [ s] : so it was very m uch sort of " Leader " and [ disfm arker] and
[ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and " Led " sort of relat ionship .
m e013 [ s] : And um [ pause] t he guy I was prim arily doing t his wit h uh is
[ disfm arker] is a visit ing researcher , uh , in t his l m eet ing , uh , you
are m y graduat e st udent ,
m e013 [ s] : but uh it ’s not t aking t hat kind of role at all ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e011 [ s^ aa^ m ] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : You ’re [ disfm arker] you ’re [ disfm arker] you ’re act ually
leading t he m eet ing for t he m ost part , m ost of t his m eet ing ,
m e011 [ s^ bd] : Well , it ’s just cuz it ’s m y t urn .
m e013 [ s.%−] : so it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa^ rt |s^ bd] : Yeah , well , what ever .
m e013 [ fh|s^ no] : So [ pause] Uh [ pause] Yeah , so I [ disfm arker] I
don’t know ,
m e013 [ %−] : so y ou ’re suggest ing [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ cs] : I t hink t his one needs t o be open − ended ,
fe016 [ s^ e^ r] : com plet ely open − ended ,
fe016 [ s] : and t he only concern I would have is if t here ’s som et hing
we wanna be able t o say and we can’t put it in t hat field .
fe008 [ s.%] : Well , t he t here ’s [ disfm arker] @ @ I m ean .
fe008 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] g you [ disfm arker] You ’re t he expert on t he D
T
m e011 [ s^ bd] : Well , t he D T Ds m ean we can do what ever
[ disfm arker] however we want it .
fe008 [ %−] : but [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ df^ nd] : But what I [ disfm arker] what I was t hinking uh
[ disfm arker] t he reason t hat I didn’t want t o m ake it com plet ely open −
ended is t hat it does seem s like t here is som e st ruct ure which is
com m on .
m e011 [ s] : Especially wit h t hese pairwise ones , where you can
describe t hem and pairwise .
fe016 [ s^ bu.%−] : So you m ean like [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ cs] : And y ou m ight want a t ool t hat used t hat inform at ion .
fe016 [ qy .%−−] : Is t here a way t hat we can add keywords or sub
fe016 [ qy ^ d] : I don’t know what you would call t hem , but lit t le labels
for t hings t hat we decide are useful t hings t o have
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Sure , absolut ely .
fe016 [ s] : but You know , as long as we have t his one place where it
can all be st ored , t hen we ’re fine , I t hink .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ df.%−] : Right , cuz it seem s like it ’s sort of a
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : and t hose ’ll probably occur [ disfm arker] I m ean , t o us , we
’ll t hink of a few of t hem , som e ot her researcher will t hink of som e
t ot ally different key word .

m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ fg] : Ex act ly .
m e013 [ s^ df] : It ’s sort of a research quest ion , you [ disfm arker] you
’re analy zing t he m eet ing and you ’re deciding , " ah , t here ’s t his kind
of st ruct ure t o it . "
fe016 [ s] : Y Yeah , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s gonna
change [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : It ’s gonna change ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs.%−] : and m aybe we wanna regroup t hings under different
labels lat er ,
m n005 [ s^ ba] : Int erest ing .
fe016 [ s.%−] : if we figure out t hat t hese pairwise t hings are
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg|s.%−−] : Right [ com m ent ] Well I t hink [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ]
being [ disfm arker] being in a com m on organizat ion was one I hadn’t
t hought of , t hat [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ %−] : Well [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ba] : So you ’re foot ball league was a good one .
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : So t he ones I ’ve been t hinking of are all sort of uh ,
power , responsibilit y .
m e011 [ s^ cs^ j] : I guess husband − wife is yet anot her one .
fe008 [ s] : And so , you know , in discourse [ pause] analysis you get
t hings like @ @ t he role .
m e011 [ s^ fe] : Ach !
fe008 [ s.%−] : You have [ disfm arker] you have a role in relat ionships
and it has t o do wit h your negot iat ing your [ disfm arker] how you ’re
perceiv ed and how y and how t he ot her @ @ [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Hm m .
m n005 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Role , yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : You know , and so t here are various t hings you negot iat e .
fe008 [ s] : And [ pause] I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m wondering if we m ight be
able t o do it s in sort of a loose way , but e wit h [ disfm arker] by having
a searchable field like " role "
fe008 [ s^ cs] : and t hen you know " wit hin t his cont ext t his person has
t he following roles " , and it could be very loose ,
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : but t hen it would be possible t o do som et hing as sim ple
as a grep across a dat abase

fe008 [ s] : and if you ’re int erest ed in y ou know which [ disfm arker]
which [ disfm arker] which ones t his person serves as an advisor in and
v ersus y ou know a l uh s uh what ever , a leader , speaker , what ever ,
[ pause] y ou could just grep for " role " and [ disfm arker] and you know ,
som e [ disfm arker] som e part icular value .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So it sounds like having t he facilit y is great ,
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : and t hen over a period of t im e as t he research happens
on t his we m ight dev elop [ pause] som e of t hese cat egories t hat would
be generally useful
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Som e m ore .
m e013 [ s] : and it [ disfm arker] it sounds like a good t hing t o do .
fe008 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ fg] : Int erest ing . Good .
fe008 [ s] : And syst em at ize also m aybe t he encoding of it if
[ disfm arker] as we find som e are useful and som e are not so useful .
m e011 [ b] : Nope .
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah , so what I have right now is all pairwise ,
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : so t hat ’s probably not sufficient .
fe008 [ s^ nd] : I t hink you don’t need t o have t hat m uch st ruct ure built
in , and t hat would be less t im e − consum ing t o do it t his way first , and
t hen find out what st ruct ure ’s needed .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , m aybe not .
m e011 [ b] : Yep . OK .
m e018 [ qw] : what about all of t he m eet ings t hat have been recorded
so far t hat [ disfm arker] wit hout t his ?
m e018 [ qo.%−] : Will [ disfm arker] Will som ebody go back and fill t hat in
, or we just won’t hav e it , or [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Well , I t hink t hat in a lot of t he m eet ings people won’t be
filling t his out any way .
m e011 [ s] : So really what I want t o have is a place t hat if a researcher
want s t hat inform at ion , t hey can add it .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : Alm ost all of t he m eet ings t hat we have are recorded wit h
roughly t his group
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh and uh [ pause] y ou know and [ pause] a fair m inorit y
wit h t he group t hat we have in t he m orning ,
m e013 [ s] : so t his is not a lot of people .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−] : We could easily [ disfm arker] There ’s just a couple
ot her m eet ings t hat
m e011 [ b] : Right .

m e011 [ s^ 2] : So it [ disfm arker] We can regenerat e a lot of t his
inform at ion .
m e018 [ s^ bs.%−] : So it wouldn’t be t hat hard t o go back and
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ df] : But [ disfm arker] Even if we can’t , generat e it , I t hink it
’s alright t o have som e of t he sect ions in y our dat abase blank , t hat
t his inform at ion was not collect ed for t his m eet ing .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : And t here ’s just not gonna be a way around t hat .
m e011 [ s] : That ’s just gonna happen
m e011 [ s] : like t he N S A m eet ing , t he net works m eet ing .
m e011 [ s] : I don’t t hink t hey ’re gonna want t o fill out t hat inform at ion
.
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ s^ t ^ t c] : OK , enough on form s .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ df] : OK , so we ’re running kind of lat e ,
m n005 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : so we ’ll probably wanna zip t hrough som e ot her t hings
, m aybe do som e m ore t im e on [ disfm arker] on Jose ’s st uff lat er ,
m e013 [ s^ t ] : um [ pause] uh St at us of Transcript ion ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : Uh , I guess , you know , we [ disfm arker] we recent ly
woke up um our friends
m e013 [ fh] : and uh
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : so I [ disfm arker] I guess [ disfm arker] you ’ve sent off
t his [ disfm arker] t he uh CD − ROMs
m e013 [ qy ^ d.%−] : and you got som e response from [ disfm arker] from
uh IBM about [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : They hav en’t receiv ed t hem yet ,
m e011 [ s] : but I did get a response from t hem saying " Yes we ’re st ill

m e011 [ s] : we hav en’t done anyt hing yet . " basically .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fh] : And uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qr.%−] : Was t here som e suggest ion t hat t hey m ight soon , or
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .

t o som eone else .
m e011 [ s^ no] : I [ pause] can’t rem em ber his nam e McCoond ?
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : McCoond

m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

m e011 [ s] : Som et hing like t hat ,
m e011 [ fh] : but uh [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : And so he sent m e em ail and said he ’s gonna be st art ing
t o work on it ,
m e011 [ s] : and I hav en’t received anyt hing else .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Great , OK .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s^ t c] : Well , t hat was t hat one .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fg] : Um ,
m e011 [ s^ cc] : So t om orrow I ’ll send a em ail and just ask if he

m e011 [ s] : he should be get t ing it t oday .
m e011 [ s^ bsc] : Act ually he should have got t en it yest erday .
m e011 [ s] : But . Giv e him a day .
m e013 [ fg|s] : um , and I t hink we should just sort of look at t his t hing
from y ou , off − line Jose
m e013 [ s^ df] : cuz it ’s get t ing kind of lat e
m n005 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : but I m ean I t hink t he bot t om line just glancing t hrough it
is t hat t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s a lot of overlap , in just energy
relat ed t hings
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and so you need som et hing else .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , t hat ’s sort of [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ s^ rt .%−] : And uh what [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] so I ’d
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw.%−] : What about t hat error t hat [ disfm arker] t hat uh
[ pause] t he [ disfm arker] t he supposed lub
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : The residual error ?
m e018 [ s^ ar|s.%−] : no , t he supposed bug [ pause] t hat was
[ disfm arker] t hat we were [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : We were guessing you had a bug before
m e018 [ s^ rt .%−−] : because [ pause] y ou went t hrough and you

fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ s^ bk] : Ah , yeah yeah .
m n005 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I found t he error , and I repeat ed t he

m n005 [ s.%−] : eh and here , eh [ pause] you can find t he new result s
eh [ pause] wit h [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Ah .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ bu] : OK , so t his is post bug fix .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah , yeah .

m n005 [ qy^ d^ rt .%] : OK ?
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Good , OK .
m e013 [ fg|s] : So um [ disfm arker] so I had t wo t hought just glancing
t hrough t his .
m e013 [ s] : So , one is [ disfm arker] one is t hat um t hat uh [ pause] we
m ight wanna t alk about norm alizat ion .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , I don’t know what norm alizat ions you use .
m e013 [ s] : Som et im es t hings have m ore overlap before you ’ve done
som e kind of norm alizat ion
m e013 [ s] : and we m ight t hink about what different kinds of

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t he ot her t hing is t hat , if t hat isn’t @ @ uh so
m uch of t he issue , t hen probably [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , residual LPC energy and just plain energy are very
closely relat ed , ev en t hough t hey ’re different
m e013 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : and um so um [ pause] you really m ay need t o go t o
som et hing t hat looks at i in som e sense harm onicit y , or um [ pause]
um [ nonvocalsound] relat ionship t o or [ disfm arker] fit [ disfm arker] fit
t o pit ch t racks on uh [ disfm arker] on eit her side of [ disfm arker] of it ,
for inst ance ?
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Hm m .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e.%−] : You know , so if [ disfm arker] if t here ’s uh a really
bad fit bet ween where t he pit ch is going in t his suppose [ disfm arker]
uh hypot hesized region of overlap , and t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] and one or t he ot her uh side , you know , t hen t his
[ disfm arker] t his [ disfm arker] t his m ight uh , suggest a [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s^ 2] : Anot her side .
m n005 [ s^ 2] : an alt erat ion in t h in t he t racking way .
m e013 [ qy ^ br^ rt ] : Excuse m e ?
m n005 [ s.%−−] : You m ean t hat eh you ehm [ pause] m m m [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s] : I underst and t hat eh you [ disfm arker] you m ean eh t o
[ disfm arker] t o st udy t he alt erat ion bet ween t he [ disfm arker] t he
t racking of t he pit ch eh if we com pare t he overlapping zone wit h a
speaker zone .
m e013 [ s] : I if you have t wo [ disfm arker] if you have t wo [ disfm arker] if
y ou hav e [ pause] uh [ pause] t wo people speaking uh [ pause] and
t here ’s an ov erlap , t hen [ disfm arker] I m ean t he first t hing is t hat
t here should be a m ixt ure of harm onics [ pause] uh during overlapped
v oice sect ions any way .
m n005 [ s] : in t he co in t he cont ext .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ s] : And um t he [ disfm arker] any [ disfm arker] a m easure t hat
y ou hav e of how m uch of t he energy is due t o your best guess at a
part icular harm onic sequence , it ’s also going t o be a sm aller fract ion
.
m e013 [ s] : This is , you know , relat ed t o t he harm onicit y sort of t hing
.
m n005 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen t he ot her t hing I ’m saying is t hat if you look at
t he t em poral ev olut ion [ pause] of t he pit ch t here should be som et hing
like a discont inuit y t here .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Now , t here ’s ot her places where you ’ll have
discont inuit ies in pit ch and speech ,
m e013 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] m aybe it ’ll have
som et hing t o [ disfm arker] have a different charact er .
m e013 [ s^ df^ rt ] : But it seem s like energy [ disfm arker] energy t ells
y ou som et hing ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : but uh if [ disfm arker] unless t his is a norm alizat ion
problem , it looks from your result s like t here ’s so m uch overlap t hat
[ pause] cert ainly you need som et hing t hat isn’t energy − like , in
addit ion t o it , at least .
m n005 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n005 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ qr.%−] : Are [ disfm arker] Are t he t hings in t he [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s] : I don’t norm alicized eh in t hese er experim ent s . by t he
m om ent .
m n005 [ s^ r] : I don’t norm alicize .
m e013 [ s^ bk|qy ] : OK , so t he quest ion is [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker]
would som e kind of norm alizat ion [ pause] help .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah ?
m e013 [ s] : You know , uh , i i it could be t hat if you norm alized uh by
t he ov erall um [ pause] energy uh for uh you know som e [ disfm arker]
som e longer period of t im e or som et hing , uh [ pause] t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat t here would be m ore of a dist inct ion .
m n005 [ b] : Nnn .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s^ 2] : The different zone .
m e013 [ s^ no] : uh , I [ disfm arker] I don’t know .
m e018 [ fg|s.%−−] : So , uh , from [ disfm arker] from t hese chart s , are
[ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : hm m , I ’m just t rying t o rem em ber where we were ,
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : but uh , were [ disfm arker] you were int erest ed
in finding out if you can t ell t he difference bet ween [ pause] overlap
and single speakers by looking at t he e energy ,

m e018 [ s^ e^ rt ] : like say , for exam ple , t he m ean of t he energy .
m e018 [ qy ^ g^ rt ] : Was t hat t he idea ?
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : So , if y ou look at [ disfm arker] on t his page t hat has uh
fram e energy ,
m e018 [ s] : y ou look at t he m ean for t he overlap , t hat ’s fort y − four
point six t y − t wo versus t he m ean for t he speakers , t hirt y − nine point
six t y − t wo ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : so t here seem s t o be m ore energy when t here ’s
ov erlapping which m akes sense ,
m e013 [ s^ 2] : Which is t he int uit ion ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : un unfort unat ely t here ’s a st andard deviat ion of like t en ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ %−] : but [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah ,
fe008 [ b] : Oh .
m e013 [ s^ e.%−−] : so [ pause] [ v ocalsound] For each one ,
m n005 [ s] : The product of t he deviat ion is t he vari is t he variance .
m e018 [ s] : different t han st andard deviat ion .
m e013 [ b] : yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ qy ^ rt ] : But are we assum ing t hat you could know t he energy
for a speaker when t here ’s no overlap ?
fe016 [ s.%−−:s.%−−] : I m ean I can im agine a m odel where you say , OK ,
y ou know I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m gonna give m yself [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : And [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound]
[ v ocalsound] And [ disfm arker] And did [ disfm arker] is t his from t he
m ix ed signal ?
fe016 [ s:s] : it ’s cheat ing ,
fe016 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : but not com plet ely if t hey ’re oft en not overlapping
and norm alized for t he speaker
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ qrr] : or is t hat not allowed .
fe016 [ qw.%−−] : I m ean , what ’s t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Well , t hat ’s what I was suggest ing , t hat y you wanna
do som e kind of longer t im e norm alizat ion eh wit h t he [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s.%−−] : ev en if you m ake a m ist ake occasionally , t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat i is roughly i is t here som e corresponding t o t hat
speaker , so t hat if you , if [ disfm arker] if uh [ disfm arker] [ pause] if you
fe016 [ b] : right
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df] : because t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s gonna spread out
t hese dist ribut ions really a lot , t o not do any kind of norm alizat ion ,
fe016 [ b] : right
m e013 [ s] : and so t hat [ disfm arker] t hat could m ask t he effect
som ewhat .
m e018 [ fg|s^ t c] : so t he um [ disfm arker] just one m ore clarifying
quest ion [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : On t he overlap cat egory , [ pause] is t hat
ov erlapping of speakers only ?
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : It doesn’t include som e of t he ot her sounds ?
m n005 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n005 [ s] : It ’s a pu pure overlapping zone .
m e013 [ s] : So t hat ’s why it doesn’t add up down [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s] : I m ean t hat eh overlapping bet ween t wo , t hree , four eh
eh speaker .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n005 [ %−] : Th
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , so t here is som e norm alizat ion already , in t hat
t hey ’v e been v olum e equalized uh over t he ent ire signal .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right , right .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : That ’s what m akes it [ pause] seem difficult ,
m n005 [ s.%−] : Because t hey [ disfm arker] t hey ’re [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ df] : because you ’re already left wit h a high st andard
deviat ion
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : and t hey ’re already roughly
fe016 [ s^ bu] : so t hat each person ’s hearable ,
fe016 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ? [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : so sort of equally loud , percept ually anyway .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe008 [ qw] : What about doing it wit h just t he single channels ?
m n005 [ qw^ br^ rt ] : Sorry ?
fe008 [ qw.%−−] : What about ,

fe008 [ fh] : uh
m n005 [ qy^ cs^ d^ rt ] : Say t his graphic ?
fe008 [ s.%−] : Well , I [ disfm arker] I ’m t hinking [ disfm arker] so t hey ’re
raising t he quest ion about t he fact t hat if you use t he m ixed signal ,
t here ’s already been a [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s] : I use t he m ixed signal wit hout norm alizat ion [ disfm arker]
wit hout norm alizat ion ,
m e011 [ s^ df^ ng] : Well , but t he m ix ed signal already has a
norm alizat ion in it .
fe008 [ s.%−] : I [ disfm arker] I ’m wo
m n005 [ fg] : but [ disfm arker] but
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Ex act ly .
fe008 [ s] : So what I ’m wondering is what about doing som e of t his
wit h t he single channel recordings .
m n005 [ s^ bk] : Ah .
m n005 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t st udy t he single channel yet
m n005 [ s^ ba] : but eh is eh [ disfm arker] is an idea .
m e011 [ s] : Well , I t hink it ’ll be worse ,
m e011 [ qy^ d^ g] : right ,
m e011 [ s.%−−] : I t hink t he m ixed [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ s] : t o [ disfm arker] t o begin t o work wit h t he [ pause] eh
[ pause] wit h t he one single channel . Now .
m e013 [ s^ t c] : I hav e anot her [ disfm arker] anot her t hought .
m e013 [ s] : Um , t his is [ disfm arker] t his is fram e energy ,
m e013 [ s] : of course fram e [ disfm arker] fram es have a lot of variance
t o t hem
m e013 [ s^ df] : because different sounds are different loudnesses .
m e013 [ qr^ cs] : So I m ean , what if you t ook uh one second chunks or
som et hing like t hat .
m n005 [ b.x ] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Or [ disfm arker] or m aybe not even a second ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : m ay be a quart er of a second or som et hing ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : so t hat you would t ypically have t wo or t hree basically
sy llable kind of lengt h [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fg|s] : Yeah , like t wo hundred m illiseconds
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : or t went y t o t went y − five fram es ,
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : Or window it [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fh] : or
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−] : So t hen you [ disfm arker] you ’ll [ disfm arker] you know
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ e] : ham m ing window .
m e013 [ s^ am ] : Som et hing ,

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : So [ disfm arker] so I m ean , so you know t wo
hundred , t hree hundred four hundred m ill
m e013 [ s] : som e longer chunk of t im e ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and t hen you looked at t he am ount of energy in t hat .
m e013 [ qr] : and how does t hat vary ov er t hese different cases .
m n005 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe016 [ s] : or voiced regions ,
fe016 [ qy ^ rt ] : I m ean can we t ell ?
m e013 [ s^ aa^ m ] : or voiced regions .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Int erest ing .
fe016 [ qr^ rt ] : can we [ disfm arker] sorry I m ean , is it known whet her
som et hing ’s voiced here , or is it roughly est im at e [ disfm arker]
est im at eable ?
m e013 [ s] : Well , I m ean , you could do a [ disfm arker] you could first
det erm ine t hat som et hing was voiced or not .
fe016 [ qy ] : I m ean like if one speaker ’s v oicing and t he ot her one isn’t
and t hey ’re overlapping , do we know t hat t he first speaker ’s voicing ,
or not ?
m e013 [ s] : Well , I m ean t he overlaps are t ypically m ore t han just a
t iny lit t le bit of t im e
m n005 [ b] : Ah .
m e013 [ s] : and so uh t here could be voiced and non − voiced pieces
during t he ov erlap .
m e011 [ b] : Huh .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ qy ] : But will we be able t t o det ect t he voicing when t here ’s
ov erlap ?
fe016 [ s] : That ’s what I just wondered .
m e013 [ s^ no^ rt ] : I don’t know ,
m e013 [ s^ bu] : because it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] t his
[ disfm arker] t his has t o do wit h t hese quest ions of harm onicit y , and
so fort h ,
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s.%−] : So if we could , or if you could do som e of it ,
m n005 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : y eah ,
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe016 [ s] : t hen um , voiced regions would be , like , probably m ore
inform at ive , for energy
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .

fe016 [ %−−] : because [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : Right , so you could do som et hing like , uh
fe016 [ s^ e] : and pi and pit ch for t hat m at t er .
m e013 [ %−] : but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Sure .
m e013 [ s] : But I t hink what will be easy for him t o do would be t o do
t his t hing of looking over a large enough region of t im e .
m e013 [ s] : Cuz if you look over a large enough region of t im e , m ost of
t he t im e y ou ’ll hav e som e voiced [ disfm arker] a fair am ount of voiced
uh energy in it .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−] : And so I t hink t hat would be [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : And he has on his graph som et hing like fort y percent .
m e011 [ s] : It looked like fift y percent or m ore are point t wo seconds
or longer overlap
m e011 [ s] : It ’s li I t hink t he last page .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy^ bh] : Is it ?
fe008 [ s] : That ’ll also lessen t he [ pause] st andard deviat ion .
m n005 [ s] : Here in t he [ disfm arker] y eah it [ disfm arker] it ’s a new

m n005 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And once you do t hat just for voiced ,
m e013 [ fh] : um um
m e013 [ s.%−] : I guess you ’d [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ cs] : You can also look at just t he voiced regions lat er .
fe016 [ s^ ba^ df] : I m ean , t hat would be t he m ost sensit ive m easure .
fe016 [ s^ df.%−−] : because you know , if you ’re norm alizing for voiced ,
and t hen you look at regions t hat are voiced wit h t he sam e robust ness
in est im at ion of what voicing is , um , you should be m uch m ore
sensit ive t o t he [ disfm arker] t o t he overlaps t hen if you [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ df] : you know if you norm alize but you look everywhere at
[ disfm arker] at [ disfm arker] at fricat ives or som et hing you won’t really
know any t hing .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : So I m ean assum ing if it ’s t rue t hat t he overlap regions are
sort of long enough t hat t here ’s som e v oicing in each of t hem , by
each of t he speakers , t hen you should do very well if you do t his .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ df] : But y ou ’ll only know t hat in t he re voiced regions
m n005 [ b] : Hm m .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : but t hose are close enough t o t he [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : You know , t here ’s enough v oicing going on and off uh t hat
if y ou can capt ure t he voicing and if y ou can capt ure it when t here ’s
ov erlap t hen y ou should do quit e well t here .
m n005 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n005 [ b] : Mm m .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I ’m wondering about um if t here [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I suppose t his is st ill just t hat one [ disfm arker] t hat one
dat a sam ple ,
fe008 [ qy^ d^ g] : right ,
fe008 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : t hat one m eet ing ?
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : But it seem s like t o have [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it
seem s like a very hard t est t o have it be looking at t he energy of all
t he speakers com bined rat her t han t aking s you know , m aybe t wo
ex t rem e speakers out of t he m ix and seeing if if it ’s prom ising wit h
respect t o [ pause] t hat t ype of analysis .
m e013 [ %−] : w
fe008 [ s^ cs.%−−] : If y ou t ake like a t arget speaker , and [ pause]
m ay be
m e013 [ s^ am ] : Yeah .

fe008 [ s^ cs] : well , I m ean , if t here ’s enough dat a , m aybe t wo
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : t wo t arget speakers
fe008 [ s^ cs] : and t hen com pare t hat t o t he m ix t ure of all t he
speakers .
m e013 [ s^ am ] : You could do t hat ,
m e013 [ b] : y eah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , be [ disfm arker] i And if t hey st ill overlapped , i i
t he [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba.%] : That ’s hard .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : But [ disfm arker] but I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat [ pause]
t his is a good first t hing , t o just sort of see .
m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and what t his says is t hat [ disfm arker] t h
t hat wit hout any special norm alizat ion at least , t his is [ disfm arker]
t here ’s a lot of ov erlap here .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And so [ disfm arker] I m ean com ing back t o Jose ’s
quest ion ,
m e013 [ qr.%−−] : I m ean t here ’s st ill t his issue of [ disfm arker] of
[ disfm arker] of how m uch t im e [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw] : What do you look at in order t o norm alize ?
m e013 [ qr] : I m ean , dur you [ disfm arker] you get som e dat a in , you
don’t know which it is , how do you [ disfm arker] how do you
[ disfm arker] W w what period of t im e do you look over t o norm alize it by
?
m n005 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and uh , [ pause] t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat
’s som et hing t o t hink about and experim ent wit h .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : I t hink also t he harm onics would be very im port ant .
fe016 [ s^ cs.%−−] : So if you can find v oiced regions and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : You know , if you hav e t wo speakers and t hey ’re bot h
v oicing
fe016 [ s] : unless t hey have very sim ilar , you know , pit ch , you should
be able t o see t he [ pause] difference in harm onics pret t y clearly
m e013 [ fg|s] : Right , so t hat ’s what we were t alking about before wit h
harm o wit h harm onicit y m easure .
fe016 [ s] : just by count ing t hem ,
m e011 [ fg|%−] : Um [ disfm arker] And [ disfm arker] t he lengt h
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−] : I m ean
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .

fe016 [ fg|s] : yeah , so even if you ’re not exact ly sure when t he
ov erlap st art s and ends because t here ’s som e [ pause] non − voiced
regions , at least you can [ pause] have t hese islands of reliabilit y
where y ou ’re pret t y sure .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah . So .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : It seem s like wit h t he ov erlaps being fairly long , t hat
should m ake it easier .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right ,
m e011 [ s^ ba] : That r t hat was an int erest ing st at ist ic .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : and y ou could put an est im at e [ disfm arker] est im at e ,
y ou know , a fuzzy st art and end t im e .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : That t hey ’re m uch longer t han I ex pect ed .
m n005 [ s^ ng] : But t his is very short .

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s] : Is a problem t o det ect .
fe016 [ s] : Well , it ’s sort of good , t hough , if you ’re [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] [ pause] for [ disfm arker] for your accuracy .

m n005 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I didn’t want t o just pop out an

m n005 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : Two hundred m illiseconds , ham m ing window .
m n005 [ s] : Because [ disfm arker] because t he [ disfm arker] t he

m e018 [ qy^ d] : So it was posit ioning random ly ?
m n005 [ s] : and I hav en’t problem .
m e011 [ qy ^ rt ] : Did you t ypecast t o long ?

m n005 [ s] : a very long file .
m e013 [ s] : Well , what he ’s saying is t hat t he t ypecast ing could be
t he issue , for F − seek .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : Right , if you ’re sending at [ disfm arker] an int eger
