fe046 [ s^ cc^ r] : I ’ll send it ,
fe004 [ s] : You can send it t o m e .
m n015 [ %−] : if [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe046 [ b] : y eah .
m n015 [ s.%−] : Now , i
fe004 [ s^ co] : Don’t worry ,
fe004 [ s^ df] : we [ disfm arker] t his doesn’t concern you anym ore ,
Robert .
fe004 [ s^ ba] : It ’s fine .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : How [ disfm arker] however I suggest t hat if you
[ disfm arker] if y ou look at your em ail carefully you m ay t hink
[ disfm arker] you m ay find t hat you already have it .
fe004 [ s^ fe] : Oops .
fe004 [ qy^ br^ d^ m ^ rt ] : Already ?
fe004 [ qh] : Really ?
fe004 [ s^ fe] : Oops .
fe046 [ s.%−] : Probab
m n015 [ s^ am ] : Maybe .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ no^ rt ] : I don’t rem em ber get t ing anyt hing .
m n015 [ s^ cc] : W we ’ll see .
m n015 [ s^ t ^ t c] : Anyhow ,
m n015 [ fh] : um t he uh
m n015 [ fg|s] : Yeah , not only
m n015 [ s] : Also we will t alk about Linguist ics and of course Com put er
Science .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ fg|s] : Um and t hen , secondly , we had , you m ay rem em ber ,
um t he problem wit h t he re − phrasing ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : t hat subject always re − phrase sort of t he t ask t hat uh
we gave t hem ,
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : and so we had a m eet ing on Friday t alking about how
t o av oid t hat ,

m n015 [ s] : and it proved finally fruit ful in t he sense t hat we cam e up
wit h a new scenario for how t o get t he [ disfm arker] t he subject m t o
really hav e int ent ions
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : and sort of t o act upon t hose ,
m n015 [ fh] : and um
m n015 [ s] : t here t he idea is now t hat nex t act ually we [ disfm arker] we
need t o hire one m ore person t o act ually do t hat job
m n015 [ s^ df] : because it [ disfm arker] it ’s get t ing m ore com plicat ed .
m n015 [ s^ co] : So if you know anyone int erest ed in [ disfm arker] in
what i ’m about t o describe , t ell t hat person t o [ disfm arker] t o writ e a
m ail t o m e or Jerry soon ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : fast .
m n015 [ fh|s] : Um [ v ocalsound] t he idea now is t o sort of com e up wit h
a high lev el of sort of abst ract t asks
m n015 [ s:s] : " go shopping "
m n015 [ s:s] : um " t ake in uh a bat ch of art "
m n015 [ fh] : um
m n015 [ %−−] : " v isit [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s:s] : do som e sight seeing "
m n015 [ s] : blah − blah − blah − blah − blah ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : sort of analogous t o what Fey has st art ed in
[ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in com piling [ disfm arker] com piling here
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : and already [ disfm arker] she has already gone t o t he
t rouble of [ disfm arker] of anchoring it wit h specific um o [ com m ent ] um
ent it ies and real world places you will find in Heidelberg .
m n015 [ fh] : And um .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : So out of t hese f s t hese high level cat egories t he
subject can pick a couple ,
m n015 [ s] : such as if [ disfm arker] if t here is a cop uh a cat egory in
em pt y ing your roll of film , t he person can t hen decide " OK , I wanna
do t hat at t his place " ,
m n015 [ s] : sort of m ake up t heir own it inerary a and [ disfm arker] and
t asks
m n015 [ s] : and t he person is not allowed t o t ake sort of t his h high
lev el cat egory list wit h t hem ,
m n015 [ fh] : but uh
m n015 [ s] : t he person is able t o t ake not es on a m ap t hat we will give
him and t he m ap will be a t ourist ’s sort of schem at ic represent at ion
wit h [ disfm arker] wit h sym bols for t he object s .
m n015 [ s^ cs:s] : And so , t he person can m aybe m ake a m ent al not e
t hat " ah yeah I want ed t o go shopping here "
m n015 [ s:s] : and " I want ed t o m aybe t ake a pict ure of t hat "
m n015 [ s:s] : and " m aybe um eat here "
m n015 [ s] : and t hen goes in and solves t he t ask wit h t he syst em ,
m n015 [ s] : IE [ com m ent ] Fey ,
m n015 [ fh] : and um

m n015 [ s] : and we ’re gonna t ry out t hat [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ] : Any quest ions ?
fe004 [ fg|qy ^ bu^ d] : so um y y ou ’ll hav e t hose say som ewhere what
t heir int ent ion was [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bu] : so you st ill have t he [ disfm arker] t he nice t hing about
having dat a where you know what t he act ual int ent ion was ?
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m . Yeah .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : But t hey will um [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s:s] : There ’s not hing t hat says y ou know " t hese are t he
t hings y ou want t o do "
fe004 [ s:s] : so t hey ’ll say " well t hese are t he t hings I want t o do "
fe004 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Right ,
fe004 [ s^ bu] : so t hey ’ll have a lit t le bit m ore nat ural int eract ion ?
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ ba] : Hopefully .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So t hey ’ll be given t his m ap , which m eans t hat
t hey won’t hav e t o like ask t he syst em for in for like high level
inform at ion about where t hings are ?
m n015 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah it ’s a schem at ic t ourist m ap .
m n015 [ s] : So it ’ll be uh i it ’ll st ill require t he [ disfm arker] t hat
inform at ion
m n015 [ %−] : and An
fe004 [ qy^ bu^ d.%−−] : It w it doesn’t have like st reet s on it t hat would
allow t hem t o figure out t heir way [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ nd] : N not [ disfm arker] not [ disfm arker] not really t he
st reet net work .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ b] : Nuh .
m e045 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : So you ’re just saying like what part of t own t he
t hings are in or what ever ?
m n015 [ s^ aa|%−−] : Yeah a
m n015 [ fh] : and um
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : t he m ap is m ore a m eans for t hem t o have t he
buildings and t heir nam es
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : and m aybe som e m a m a m ajor st reet s and t heir nam es
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : and we want t o m aybe ask t hem , if you have [ disfm arker]
get it sort of isolat ed st reet
m n015 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] t he , what ever ,
m n015 [ s] : " River St reet " ,
m n015 [ s:s] : and t hey know t hat [ disfm arker] t hey have decided t hat ,
y es , t hat ’s where t hey want t o do t his kind of act ion um t hat t hey
have it wit h t hem and t hey can act ually read t hem
m n015 [ s] : or sort of have t he label for t he object

m n015 [ s^ df] : because it ’s t oo hard t o m em orize all t hese st st range
Germ an nam es .
m n015 [ s] : And t hen we ’re going t o have anot her [ disfm arker] we ’re
gonna have w anot her t rial run
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : IE t he first wit h t hat new set up t om orrow at t wo
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : and we have a real int erest ing subject which is Ron Kay
m n015 [ s] : for who [ disfm arker] t hose who know him , he ’s t he
founder of ICI .
m n015 [ s] : So he ’ll [ disfm arker] he ’s around seven sevent y years old
, or som et hing .
fe004 [ s^ no] : I didn’t know he was t he founder .
fe004 [ %−] : That ’s [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : And he also approached m e and he offered t o help
[ v ocalsound] um our project
m n015 [ s] : and he was m ore t hinking about som e high level t hinking
t asks
m n015 [ s:s] : and [ v ocalsound] I said " sure we need help
m n015 [ s:s^ cs] : y ou can com e in as a subject "
m n015 [ s:s] : and he said " OK " .
m n015 [ s] : So t hat ’s what ’s gonna happen , t om orrow ,
fe004 [ s^ bu] : Using t his new [ disfm arker] new um plan ,
m n015 [ s] : dat a .
m n015 [ s^ 2] : New [ disfm arker] new set up .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : Which I ’ll hopefully sort of scrape t oget her t
m n015 [ s] : But , t hanks t o Fey , we already have sort of a nice

m n015 [ qo] : Quest ions ?
m n015 [ qo] : Com m ent s on t hat ?
m n015 [ s] : If not , we can m ove on .
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : No ?
m n015 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : No m ore quest ions ?
fe004 [ qw^ t 3] : So what ’s t he s t his is what you m ade , Fey ?
m e045 [ s] : I ’m not sure I t ot ally underst and t his
m e045 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]

m e045 [ s] : I ’m not sure I t ot ally underst and everyt hing t hat ’s being
t alked about
fe004 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ^ t 3] : Like so [ disfm arker] So it ’s just based on like
t he m at erials y ou had about Heidelberg .
m e045 [ s] : but I [ disfm arker] I im agine I ’ll c just cat ch on .
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ] : Um are you fam iliar wit h [ disfm arker] wit h t he
[ disfm arker] wit h t he very rough set up of t he dat a ?
fe046 [ s] : Based on t he web sit e ,

which of t hree m odes um t heir quest ion uh concerns .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s.%−] : So it ’s like t he Ent er versus View [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , we [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] we will sort of
get a prot ocol of t he prior int eract ion ,
fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n015 [ s] : That ’s where t he inst ruct or , t he person we are going t o

t hings
fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ %−−] : and so

m n015 [ s:s] : t h t he q first quest ion for t he subject is , " so t hese are

m n015 [ qy ] : Is t here anyt hing t hat int erest s you ? "
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s.%−−:s.%−−] : And t he person can say " yeah , sure sh
m n015 [ s:s] : t his is som et hing I would do .
m n015 [ s:s] : I would go shopping " .
m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Yeah ?
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s:s] : and t hen we can sort of [ disfm arker] t his s inst ruct or can
say " well , uh t hen you [ disfm arker] you m ay want t o find out how t o
get ov er here
m n015 [ s] : because t his is where t he shopping dist rict is " .
fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So t he int eract ion beforehand will give t hem
hint s about how specific or how what ev er t hough t he kinds of
quest ions t hat are going t o ask during t he act ual session ?
m n015 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n015 [ s:qw] : Just sort of [ disfm arker] OK , what [ disfm arker] what

m n015 [ s^ aa|s] : Yes . In a sense t hat ’s exact ly t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t he idea ,
m n036 [ fh] : uh uh
m n015 [ s] : which is never possible in a [ disfm arker] in a s in a lab
sit uat ion ,
m n036 [ s^ ng] : Well , u u t he one experim ent t h t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat I ’ve read som ewhere , it was [ disfm arker] t hey u

m n036 [ s.%−] : Uh , but you know i i
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : We had exact ly t hat on our list of possible way t hings
m n015 [ s] : so we [ disfm arker] uh I ev en m ade a sort of a silly t hing
how t hat could work , how you cont rol you are here
m n015 [ s] : y ou [ disfm arker] y ou want t o know how t o get som eplace ,
m n015 [ s] : and t his is t he place
m n015 [ s] : and it ’s a m useum
m n015 [ s.%−−] : and y ou want t o do som e
m n015 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and t here ’s a person

m n015 [ s] : all t he different act ions , if at all possible ,
m n036 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s] : and also people will get caught up in t he pict ures .

m e045 [ fg|qw] : OK . What ’s t he next t hing ?
m e003 [ b] : Yep .
m e003 [ %] : e
m n015 [ s] : This is v ery rough but t his is sort of what um Johno and I
m anaged t o com e up wit h .
m n015 [ s.%−] : The idea here is t hat [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : This is t he uh s t he schem a of t he XML here ,
m e003 [ s^ e] : not an exam ple or som et hing like t hat .
m n015 [ s^ aa|s^ m ] : Yeah t his is not an XML
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m n015 [ s^ e] : t his is sort of t owards an [ disfm arker] a schem a ,
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : nuh ?
m n036 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s^ e] : definit ion .
m n015 [ s] : The idea is , so , im agine we have a library of schem a
m n015 [ s] : such as t he Source − Pat h − Goal
m n015 [ s] : and t hen we have forced uh m ot ion ,
m n015 [ s] : we have cost act ion ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : we have a whole library of schem as .
m n015 [ s] : And t hey ’re gonna be , you know , fleshed out in
[ disfm arker] in t heir real ugly det ail ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : Source − Pat h − Goal ,
m n015 [ s] : and t here ’s gonna be s a lot of st uff on t he Goal and blah
− blah − blah , t hat a goal can be and so fort h .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : What we t hink is [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ cs] : And all t he nam es could [ disfm arker] should be t aken "
cum grano salis " .
m n015 [ fh] : So .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : This is a [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : t he fact t hat we ’re calling t his " act ion schem a " right now
should not ent ail t hat we are going t o cont inue calling t his " act ion
schem a " .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : But what t hat m eans [ vocalsound] is we have here first
of all
m n015 [ s] : on t he [ disfm arker] in t he [ disfm arker] in t he first it erat ion
a st upid list of Source − Pat h − Goal act ions
m e003 [ s^ 2.%−−] : Act ions t hat can be cat egorized wit h [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ 2] : or t hat are relat ed t o Source − Pat h − Goal .
m n015 [ %−] : wi
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ 2] : t o t hat schem a
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : and we will have you know forced m ot ion and cost act ion
act ions .
m e003 [ s] : And t hen t hose act ions can be in m ult iple cat egories at
t he sam e t im e if necessary .
m n015 [ s] : So a push m ay be in [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in bot h
y ou know push uh in t his or t his
fe004 [ s^ bu] : Forced m ot ion and caused act ion for inst ance ,
m n015 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Ex act ly .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .

m n015 [ fg|s] : Also , t hese t hings m ay or m ay not get t heir own
st ruct ure in t he fut ure .
m n015 [ s] : So t his is som et hing t hat , y ou know , m ay also be a res As
a result of your work
m n015 [ s.%−−] : in t he fut ure , we m ay find out t hat , you know , t here
’re really s t hese subt le differences bet ween
m n015 [ fh] : um
m n015 [ s] : even wit hin t he dom ain of ent ering in t he light of a Source
− Pat h − Goal schem a , t hat we need t o put in [ disfm arker] fill in
addit ional st ruct ure up t here .
m n015 [ s^ ba] : But it gives us a nice handle .
m n015 [ s] : So wit h t his we can basically um you know s slaught er t he

m n015 [ fh] : Uh .
m n015 [ s] : It [ disfm arker] it is [ disfm arker] It was sort of a [ disfm arker]
it gav e us som e headache ,
m n015 [ qr] : how do we avoid writ ing down t hat we have sort of t he
Ent er Source − Pat h − Goal
m n015 [ s] : t hat t his [ disfm arker] But t his sort of get s t he job done in
t hat respect
m n015 [ s] : and m ay be it is ev en concept ually som ewhat adequat e in
a sense t hat um we ’re t alking about t wo different t hings .
m n015 [ s] : We ’re t alking m ore on t he sort of int ent ion level , up t here
,
m n015 [ s] : and m ore on t he [ disfm arker] t his is t he [ disfm arker] your
basic bone um schem a , down t here .
m e003 [ s] : Uh one quest ion , Robert .
m e003 [ qy] : When you point at t he screen is it your shadow t hat I ’m
supposed t o look at ?
fe004 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah . It ’s t he shadow .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e003 [ s] : Whereas I keep looking where your hand is ,
m e003 [ s.%−] : and it doesn’t [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : Well , t hat wouldn’t hav e helped you at all .
fe004 [ b.%] : Right .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s] : Basically , what t his is [ disfm arker] is t hat t here ’s an
int erface bet ween what we are doing and t he act ion planner
m e045 [ s^ t 1] : Spit right here .
m e003 [ s] : and right now t he way t he int erface is " act ion go " and
t hen t hey hav e t he [ disfm arker] what t he person claim ed was t he
source and t he person claim ed as t he goal passed on .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s] : And t he problem is , is t hat t he current syst em does not
dist inguish bet ween goes of t ype " going int o " , goes of t ype " want t o
go t o a place where I can t ake a pict ure of " , et cet era .

m n015 [ s.%−−] : So t his is sort of what it looks like
m n015 [ s] : now , som e sim ple " Go " act ion from it [ disfm arker] from
an object nam ed " Pet er ’s Kirche " of t he t ype " Church " t o an object
nam ed " Powder − Tower " of t he t y pe " Tower " .
fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : This is t he uh [ disfm arker] what t he act ion
planner uses ?
m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
fe004 [ s.%−] : This is [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ aa|s^ aap] : Right . Current ly .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ aap] : Current ly .
fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : And is t hat [ disfm arker] and t ha t hat ’s
changeable ?
fe004 [ qrr] : or not ?
m n015 [ s^ bk|%−] : Yeah , well [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qy ^ e^ rt ] : Like are we adapt ing t o it ?
fe004 [ qrr.%−−] : Or [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n015 [ s] : We [ disfm arker] This is t he out put , sort of , of t he nat ural

fe004 [ b] : Oh , yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n015 [ s] : t he input int o t he act ion planning , as it is now .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : And what we are going t o do ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : we going t o [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s.%−−] : and you can see here ,
m n015 [ s^ co] : and again for Johno please [ disfm arker] please focus
t he shadow ,
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : um we ’re gon
m n015 [ fh] : uh uh
m n015 [ s] : here you have t he act ion and t he dom ain object
m n015 [ s.%−−] : and w and on [ disfm arker] on [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qw] : What did you t hink he was doing ?
fe004 [ s^ fe^ t ^ t c] : OK , sorry .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : I just [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ cs] : A laser point er would be m ost appropriat e here I t hink
.
fe046 [ %] : Eee .
m n015 [ s|s.%−] : Yeah I [ disfm arker] I um have [ disfm arker] I have no
[ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : Robert likes t o be abst ract
m e003 [ s] : and t hat ’s what I just t hought he was doing .

fe004 [ s] : You look up here .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : Sort of bet ween here and here ,
m n015 [ s] : so as you can see t his is on one level and we are going t o
add anot her um " St ruct " , if you want , IE a rich act ion descript ion on
t hat lev el .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s.%−] : So in t he fut ure [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bu.%−] : So it ’s just an addit ional inform at ion [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Exact ly .
m n015 [ s] : In t he fut ure t hough , t he cont ent of a hypot hesis will not
only be an object and an [ disfm arker] an act ion and a dom ain object
but an act ion , a dom ain object , and a rich act ion descript ion ,
fe004 [ b] : Right ?
fe004 [ s^ e] : t hat doesn’t hurt t he current way .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ %−−] : which is [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ 2] : Which [ disfm arker] which we ’re abbreviat ing as " RAD " .
fe004 [ b] : Good .
fe004 [ b] : Hm m .
m e045 [ s^ ba^ fe] : Rad !
m e012 [ fg|s] : So um you had like an act ion schem a and a Source −
Pat h − Goal schem a ,
fe004 [ b] : Hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e012 [ qw] : So how does t his Source − Pat h − Goal schem a fit int o t he
uh act ion schem a ?
m e012 [ qy^ e^ rt ] : Like is it one of t he t ags t here ?
fe004 [ s^ bk|qy ^ rt ] : Yeah can you go back t o t hat one ?
m e003 [ s.%−−] : So t he Source − Pat h − Goal schem a in t his case ,
m e003 [ s.%−−] : I ’ve [ disfm arker] if I underst and how we described
[ disfm arker] we set t his up ,
m e003 [ fh] : um
m e003 [ s] : cuz we ’ve been arguing about it all week ,
m e003 [ s.%−−] : but uh we ’ll hold t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : Well in t his case it will hold t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] I
m ean t he [ disfm arker] t he feat ures I guess .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : I ’m not [ disfm arker] it ’s hard for m e t o exact ly s
m e003 [ s.%−−] : So basically t hat will st ore t he [ disfm arker] t he object
t hat is w
m e003 [ s^ rt ] : t he Source will st ore t he object t hat we ’re going from ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s.%−] : t he Goal will st ore t he [ disfm arker] t he f

fe004 [ s] : So t he fillers of t he role source .
m e003 [ s] : we ’ll fill t hose in fill t hose roles in ,
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e003 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : The S Act ion − schem as basically have ext ra
[ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s.%−−] : See we [ disfm arker] so t hose are [ disfm arker]
schem as exist
m e003 [ s.%−−] : because in case we need ext ra inform at ion
m e003 [ s] : inst ead of just m aking it an at t ribut e and which
[ disfm arker] which is just one t hing we [ disfm arker] we decided t o
m ake it ’s own ent it y so t hat we could explode it out lat er on in case
t here is som e st ruct ure t hat [ disfm arker] t hat we need t o exploit .
fe004 [ fg|s.%−−] : OK , so t h
fe004 [ s^ fa|s^ df.%−−] : sorry I just don’t kn
fe004 [ fh] : um um um [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : This is just uh XML m o not at ional
fe004 [ s] : but um t he fact t hat it ’s act ion schem a and t hen sort of
slash act ion schem a
fe004 [ s.%−−] : t hat ’s a whole ent it
m e003 [ s] : That ’s a block ,
fe004 [ s^ bk^ m ] : That ’s a block ,
m e003 [ b] : y eah .
fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : whereas source is just an at t ribut e ?
fe004 [ qy .%−] : Is t hat [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ ar] : No , no , no .
m n015 [ s] : Source is just not spelled out here .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK , OK .
m n015 [ s] : Source m eaning [ disfm arker] Source will be uh will have a

fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh , uh − huh .
m n015 [ s.%−] : m ay be canonical uh orient at ion [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk|s.%−] : OK could it [ disfm arker] it could also be blocked
out t hen as [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e003 [ %−−] : t he [ disfm arker] So [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : OK .
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : s Source it will be ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : you know we ’ll f
m n015 [ s^ df] : we know a lot about sources
m n015 [ s] : so we ’ll put all of t hat in Source .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : But it ’s independent whet her we are using t he SPG
schem a in an Ent er , View , or Approach m ode ,

fe004 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n015 [ s] : This is just propert ies of t he SPG [ com m ent ] schem a .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : We can t alk about Pat hs being t he fast est , t he
quickest , t he nicest and so fort h ,
m n015 [ s^ cs^ e] : uh or [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker] and t he Traject or
should be com ing in t here as well .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : And t hen G t he sam e about Goals .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So I guess t he quest ion is when you act ually fill
one of t hese out , it ’ll be under act ion schem a ?
fe004 [ s.%−−] : Those are [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bu.%−] : It ’s gonna be one [ disfm arker] y you ’ll pick one of
t hose for [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ bk|s] : OK t hese are [ disfm arker] t his is just a layout of t he
possible t hat could go [ disfm arker] play t hat role .
m e003 [ s^ bk|s] : Right , so t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he roles
will be filled in wit h t he schem a
m n015 [ qw^ br] : Hm m ?
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK , go it .
fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e003 [ s] : and t hen what act ual a act ion is chosen is [ disfm arker] will
be in t he [ disfm arker] in t he act ion schem a sect ion .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ b] : OK .
fe004 [ fg] : S S
fe004 [ fg|s] : OK , so one quest ion .
fe004 [ s] : This was [ disfm arker] in t his case it ’s all um clear , sort of
obvious ,
fe004 [ s] : but y ou can t hink of t he Ent er , View and Approach as each
having t heir roles ,
fe004 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
fe004 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] I m ean it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s im plicit t hat
t he person t hat ’s m oving is doing ent ering viewing and approaching ,
fe004 [ s.%−−] : but y ou know t he usual t hing is we have bindings
bet ween sort of [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : t hey ’re sort of like act ion specific roles and t he m ore
general Source − Pat h − Goal specific roles .
fe004 [ qr] : So are we worrying about t hat or not for now ?
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yes , yes .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : Since y ou bring it up now , we will worry about it .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ co] : Tell us m ore about it .

m n015 [ qw.%−] : What do you [ disfm arker] what do you [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qw^ br] : What ’s t hat ?
fe004 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : Oh I guess it [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ rt ] : I [ disfm arker] I m ay be just um reading t his and
int erpret ing it int o m y head in t he way t hat I ’ve always viewed t hings
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Hm m .
fe004 [ s] : and [ vocalsound] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat m ay or m ay not be
what y ou guys int ended .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : But if it is , t hen t he t op block is sort of like
fe004 [ fh|s.%−−] : um , you know , you hav e t o list ex act ly what X −
schem a
fe004 [ s^ bsc.%−−] : or in t his act ion schem a ,
fe004 [ s] : t here ’ll be a cert ain one , t hat has it s own s st ruct ure
fe004 [ s] : and m aybe it has st uff about t hat specific t o ent ering or

fe004 [ s.%−−] : but t hose could include roles like t he t hing t hat you ’re
v iewing , t he t hing t hat you ’re ent ering , t he t hing t hat you ’re
fe004 [ s] : what ever ,
fe004 [ s.%−−] : you know , t hat [ disfm arker] which are [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ bs] : So very specific role nam es are " viewed t hing " , "
ent ered t hing " [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : t hink [ disfm arker] t hink of ent er , view and approach as
fram es
fe004 [ s] : and t hey have fram e − specific param et ers and [ disfm arker]
and roles
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : and y ou can also describe t hem in a general way as Source
− Pat h − Goal schem a
fe004 [ qh] : and m aybe t here ’s ot her im age schem as t hat you could
y ou know add aft er t his t hat you know , how do t hey work in t erm s of
y ou know a force dynam ics
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ qh] : or how do t hey work in f t erm s of ot her t hings .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m , Mm − hm m , Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : So all of t hose have um basically f eit her specific
[ disfm arker] fram e specific roles or m ore general fram e specific roles
t hat m ight have binding .
fe004 [ qr] : So t he quest ion is are um [ disfm arker] how t o represent
when t hings are linked in a cert ain way .
fe004 [ s] : So we know for Ent er t hat t here ’s Cont ainer pot ent ially
inv olv ed
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : and it ’s not [ disfm arker]

fe004 [ s] : uh I don’t know if you wanna have in t he sam e level as t he
act ion schem a SPG schem a
fe004 [ s] : it [ disfm arker] it ’s som ewhere in t here t hat you need t o

fe004 [ s] : and t he int erior of it corresponds t o som e part of t he
Source − Pat h − Goal um you know goal [ disfm arker] uh goal I guess in

m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ fh|qy] : So uh is t here an easy way in t his not at ion t o show
when t here ’s ident it y basically bet ween t hings
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : and I di don’t know if t hat ’s som et hing we need t o invent
fe004 [ s.%−] : or y ou know just [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ %−−] : The [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ qw^ bu.%−−] : wa wasn’t t here supposed t o be a link in t he
m e012 [ b] : Right .
m e003 [ s^ bd] : I don’t know if t his answers your quest ion ,
m e003 [ s^ df] : I was just st aring at t his while you were t alking ,
m e003 [ s^ fa] : sorry .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : It ’s OK .
m e003 [ fh|s] : Uh a link bet ween t he act ion schem a , a field in t he s in
t he schem a for t he im age schem as t hat would link us t o which act ion

m e003 [ s.%−] : so we could [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ fh|s] : Um , well t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s one [ disfm arker]

m n015 [ s^ rt ] : t hink also t hat um we can have one or m as m any as
we want links from [ disfm arker] from t he schem a up t o t he s act ion um
descript ion of it .
fe004 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ s] : But t he not ion I got from Nancy ’s idea was t hat we m ay f

Source − Pat h − Goal schem a ,
fe004 [ b] : Exact ly .
fe004 [ b] : Right , right .
m n015 [ s] : and do we have m eans of [ disfm arker] of t elling it wit hin
t hat
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s] : a and t he answer is absolut ely .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : The way [ disfm arker] we absolut ely have t hose m eans
t hat are even part of t he M − t hree − L A API ,
fe004 [ s^ ba] : Oh great .

fe004 [ b] : s Uh − huh .
m n015 [ s] : m eaning we can reference .
m n015 [ s.%−] : So m eaning [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ fg] : Great .
fe004 [ s] : That ’s ex act ly what is necessary .
m e003 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ fh] : And um .
m e003 [ %−] : St
m n015 [ s] : This referencing t hing howev er is of t em porary nat ure
m n015 [ s^ df] : because sooner or lat er t he W − t hree − C will be

m n015 [ s^ ba] : and t hen it ’s going t o be even m uch nicer .
m n015 [ s] : Then we have real m eans of point ing at an individual

m n015 [ s.%] : That ’s
fe004 [ s^ e] : Or est im at ed .
m n015 [ s] : but it ’s soon .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK , OK .
m n015 [ s] : So it ’s g it ’s [ disfm arker] t he spec is t here
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : and it ’s gonna part of t he M − t hree − L AP [ disfm arker]
API filed by t he end of t his year
m n015 [ s] : so t hat t his m eans we can st art using it basically now .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : But t his is a t echnical det ail .
fe004 [ s] : So a point er [ disfm arker] a way t o really say point ers .
m e003 [ s] : Basically references from t he roles in t he schem a
[ disfm arker] t he bot t om schem as t o t he act ion schem as is wha uh I ’m

fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .

m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah ,
fe004 [ b] : OK .

m n015 [ s] : I m ean personally , I ’m looking even m ore forward t o t he

where it allows y ou t o say t hat if t he SPG act ion up t here is Ent er ,
t hen t he goal t ype can never be a st at ue .
fe004 [ b^ rt ] : Uh − huh .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ bu] : So you have const raint s t hat are dependent on t he c

m n015 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m , yeah .
m n015 [ %−] : W
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah e exact ly .
m n015 [ fh|s] : Um , you know t his , of course , does not m ake sense in

fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n015 [ s^ df] : however [ vocalsound] it is uh you know sort of
[ disfm arker] t hese sort of t hings are im aginable .
fe004 [ %] : Tsk .
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ e] : Or t he Gat eway Arch in St .
m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Yeah ?
m e012 [ fg|qy] : S So um , like are you gonna have sim ilar schem as for

fe004 [ s] : Louis .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ fh] : So .
m e012 [ s^ e] : like forced m ot ion and caused act ion and st uff
m e012 [ s^ e] : like you have for SPG ?
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s] : And if so like can [ disfm arker] are you able t o enforce t hat
y ou know if [ disfm arker] if it ’s [ disfm arker] if it ’s SPG act ion t hen you
have t hat schem a ,
m e012 [ s.%−] : if it ’s a forced m ot ion t hen you have t he ot her schem a
present in t he [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um we have absolut e [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n015 [ s] : We have absolut ely no m eans of enforcing t hat ,
m n015 [ s] : so it would be considered valid if we have an SPG act ion "
Ent er " and no SPG schem a , but a forced act ion schem a .
m n015 [ s^ am ] : Could happen .
fe004 [ s^ ba] : Whi − which is not bad ,
fe004 [ s^ df.%−−] : because I m ean , t hat t here ’s m ult iple sens
fe004 [ s^ df] : I m ean t hat part icular case , t here ’s m ult t here
[ disfm arker] t here ’s a forced side of [ disfm arker] of t hat verb as well .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .

m n015 [ s^ cs] : It [ disfm arker] m aybe it m eans we had not hing t o say
about t he Source − Pat h − Goal .
m e012 [ b.%] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : What ’s also nice , and for a i for m e in m y m ind
m n015 [ s] : it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s crucially necessary , is t hat we can
have m ult iple schem as and m ult iple act ion schem as in parallel .
m e012 [ b.%] : Right .
m n015 [ s] : And um we st art ed t hinking about going t hrough our

m n015 [ s:qy] : so when I say " is t here a bakery here ? "
m n015 [ s] : y ou know I do ult im at ely want our m odule t o be able t o first
of all f t ell t he rest of t he syst em " hey t his person act ually want s t o go

m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Nuh ?
m n015 [ s.%−−] : And if t hese are t wo different schem as ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : IE t he Source − Pat h − Goal schem a of get t ing t here
and t hen t he buy ing snacks schem a ,
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : nuh ? [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qy .%−] : Would t hey bot h be list ed here in [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ bu] : Under so o under act ion schem a t here ’s a list t hat can

m e003 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n015 [ qw.%−−] : so what is t he
m e045 [ s^ j] : Snack act ion .
m n015 [ qy ] : uh is [ disfm arker] is t here a " buying s snacks " schem a ?
fe004 [ s^ ba] : That ’s int erest ing .
m n015 [ qw.%−] : What is t he uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] have
fe004 [ qw^ br] : What ?
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : t he buying snack schem a ?
m e045 [ s^ co] : See .
fe046 [ s^ cs.%−] : Buying [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] buying his food
[ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ j] : I ’m sure t here ’s a com m ercial event schem a in t here

fe004 [ s^ fa] : Oop .
fe004 [ %−] : I [ v ocalsound] d f
m n015 [ b] : Yeah ,
m n015 [ s^ cs] : a " com m ercial ev ent " or som et hing .
fe004 [ %] : Yeah I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Yeah ?

m n015 [ fh|s^ rt ] : So uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] so we would
[ disfm arker] we would inst ant iat e t he SPG schem a wit h a Source − Pat h

fe004 [ s^ t 1] : I see .
m n015 [ s] : and t he buying event you know at which [ disfm arker]
howev er t hat looks like , t he place f t hing t o buy .
fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe004 [ fg] : Int erest ing .
fe004 [ qy .%−−] : Would you say t hat t he [ disfm arker] like [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : I m ean you could have a flat st ruct ure and just say t hese
are t wo independent t hings ,
fe004 [ s] : but t here ’s also t his sort of like causal ,
fe004 [ s] : well , so one is really facilit at ing t he ot her and it ’s part of a
com pound act ion of som e kind , which has st ruct ure .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : Now it ’s t echnically possible t hat you can fit schem a wit hin
schem a ,
fe004 [ s^ ba] : uh I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat ’s nicer for a lot of reasons
m n015 [ s.%−] : and schem a wit hin schem at a [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bd] : but m ight be a pain
fe004 [ fh] : so uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ h] : um
m n015 [ s.%−] : Well , for m e it seem s t hat uh [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : I m ean t here are t ruly t im es when you have t wo t ot ally
independent goals t hat t hey m ight ex press at once ,
m n015 [ s^ bk] : r Yes .
fe004 [ s] : but in t his case it ’s really like t here ’s a purpo m eans t hat
y ou know f for achieving som e ot her purpose .
m n015 [ s] : Well , if I ’m [ disfm arker] if I ’m recipient of such a m essage
m n015 [ s] : and I get a Source − Pat h − Goal where t he goal is a bakery
m n015 [ s] : and t hen I get a com m ercial act ion which t akes place in a
bakery ,
m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe004 [ b^ rt ] : Uh − huh .
m n015 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and t hey [ disfm arker]
t hey are obv iously , via ident ifiers , ident ified t o be t he sam e t hing here
.
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : See t hat [ disfm arker] t hat bot hers m e t hat t hey ’re t he
sam e t hing .
m n015 [ s^ ar|%−−] : No , no , just t he [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qy ^ bh] : Yeah ?
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah
fe004 [ s^ df] : because t hey ’re t wo different t hings
fe004 [ s.%−−] : one of which is l

fe004 [ s] : you could t hink of one a sub you know pru what ever pre −
condit ion for t he second .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah !
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe004 [ b] : Yeah , y eah .
fe004 [ fg] : So . So . OK .
fe004 [ s] : So t here ’s like levels of granularit y .
fe004 [ s] : So uh t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s um a single event of
which t hey are bot h a part .
fe004 [ s] : And t hey ’re [ disfm arker] independent ly t hey [ disfm arker]
t hey are event s which have very different charact ers as far as Source −
Pat h − Goal what ev er .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m , yeah .
fe004 [ s] : So when y ou ident ify Source − Pat h − Goal and what ever ,
t here ’s gonna t o be a desire , what ever , eat ing , hunger ,
fe004 [ s] : what ever ot her fram es you hav e involved , t hey have t o
m at ch up in [ disfm arker] in nice ways .
fe004 [ s] : So it seem s like each of t hem has it s own int ernal st ruct ure
and m apping t o t hese schem as
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ e.%−−] : you know from t he ot her [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bd] : But you know t hat ’s just [ disfm arker] That ’s just m e .
fe004 [ %−−] : Like [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : Well , I t hink we ’re gonna hit a lot of int erest ing problem s
m n015 [ s] : and as I prefaced it t his is t he result of one week of
arguing [ vocalsound] about it
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Bet ween you guys
fe004 [ fh] : uh
m e003 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ fh] : and um [ disfm arker] and so [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ fg|s] : Yeah I m ean I [ disfm arker] I st ill am not ent irely sure
t hat I really fully grasp t he synt ax of t his .
m e045 [ s.%−] : You know , like what [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s.%−] : Well it ’s not [ disfm arker] it ’s not act ually a very
[ disfm arker] act ually , it doesn’t act ually [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s.%−] : Um it occur [ disfm arker] it occurs t o m e t hat I m ean ne
m e045 [ b] : Right .
m e045 [ s^ e] : Or t he int ended int erpret at ion of t his .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ fg|s] : um well I should hav e [ disfm arker] we should have
added an ano an XML exam ple ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : or som e XML exam ples
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

fe004 [ s^ aa|s^ ba^ na] : yeah t hat would be [ disfm arker] t hat would
be nice .
m n015 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and t his is on [ disfm arker] on a
[ disfm arker] on [ disfm arker] on m y list of t hings unt il next [ disfm arker]
next week .
m e045 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : It ’s also a quest ion of t he recursiveness and [ disfm arker]
and a hier hierarchy um in t here .
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ qh^ rt ] : Do we want t he schem as just blum p blum p blum p
blum p ?
m n015 [ s] : I m ean it ’s [ disfm arker] if we can act ually you know get it
so t hat we can , out of one ut t erance , act ivat e m ore t han one
schem a , I m ean , t hen we ’re already pret t y good ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n036 [ s] : Well [ disfm arker] well y ou have t o be careful wit h t hat uh
uh t hing
m n036 [ s] : because uh [ vocalsound] I m ean m any act ions presuppose
som e [ disfm arker] um alm ost [ v ocalsound] infinit ely m any ot her
act ions .
m n036 [ s] : So if you go t o a bakery [ pause] you have a general
int ent ion of uh not being hungry .
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Mayb − yeah .
m n036 [ s] : You have a specific int ent ions t o cross t he t raffic light t o
get t here .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ b] : Yeah .
m n036 [ s] : You hav e a furt her specific int ent ions t o left [ disfm arker]
t o lift y our right foot
m n015 [ b] : Hm m ?
m n036 [ s.%−−] : and so uh uh I m ean y y ou really have t o focus on on
[ disfm arker] on
fe004 [ b.%] : Right .
m n036 [ s^ cs] : and decide t he level of [ disfm arker] of abst ract ion t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat you aim at it kind of zero in on t hat ,
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n036 [ s] : and m ore or less ignore t he rest , unless t here is som e
im plicat ions t hat [ disfm arker] t hat you want t o const ant draw from
[ disfm arker] from sub − t asks um t hat are relevant
fe004 [ %−−] : M Th
m n036 [ s^ ba] : uh I m ean but very difficult .

fe004 [ s.%−−] : The ot her t hing t hat I just t hought of is t hat you could
want t o go t o t he bakery because you ’re supposed t o m eet your
friend t here or som
m n036 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : y ou know so you [ disfm arker] like being able t o infer t he
second t hing is very useful and probably oft en right .
m e003 [ s:qy ] : Well t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he ut t erance
was " is t here a bakery around here ? " ,
fe004 [ s.%−] : But having t hem separat e [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s:s] : not " I want t o go t o a bakery . "
fe004 [ s^ ng] : Well m aybe t heir friend said t hey were going t o m eet
t hem in a bakery around t he area .
m n036 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ bd] : And I ’m , yeah [ disfm arker] I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m
inv ent ing cont ex t s which are m aybe unlikely ,
m n036 [ b] : Right .
m e003 [ s^ bk|%−] : Sure it [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : but y eah I m ean like [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ df] : but it ’s st ill t he case t hat um you could [ disfm arker] you
could ov erride t hat default by giv ing ext ra inform at ion
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m , yeah .
fe004 [ s:s] : which is t o m e a reason why you would keep t he inference
of t hat separat e from t he knowledge of " OK t hey really want t o know if
t here ’s a bakery around here " ,
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : which is direct .
m n015 [ s] : Well t here [ disfm arker] t here [ disfm arker] t here should
never be a hard coded uh [ vocalsound] short cut from [ pause] t he
bakery quest ion t o t he uh double schem a t hing ,
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ %−−] : how uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : And , as a m at t er of fact , when I have t raveled wit h m y
friends we m ake t hese [ disfm arker] ex act ly t hese kinds of

fe004 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Ex act ly .
m n015 [ %−−] : We o o
fe004 [ s] : It ’s [ disfm arker] I m et som eone at t he bakery you know in
t he Vict oria St at ion t you know [ vocalsound] t rain st at ion London
before ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n036 [ b] : Right .
m e045 [ b] : Yep .
m n036 [ %−] : Well .
fe004 [ b] : yeah .
fe004 [ %−−] : It ’s like [ disfm arker]
m n036 [ s^ rt ] : I hav e a quest ion about t he slot of t he SPG act ion .
m n036 [ s] : So [ vocalsound] t he Ent er − View − Approach t he
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he EVA um , t hose are fixed slot s in t his
part icular act ion .
m n036 [ s^ bu] : Ev ery act ion of t his kind will have a choice .
m n036 [ qr^ bu.%−−] : Or [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker] or
will it just
m n036 [ fh] : um uh [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s] : Ev ery SPG [ disfm arker] every SPG act ion eit her is an Ent er
or a View or an Approach ,
m n036 [ qy ^ rt .%−] : is it change [ disfm arker]
m n036 [ s^ bk] : Right , right .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e045 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e045 [ b] : OK .
m n036 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so I [ disfm arker] I m ean for [ disfm arker] for
each part icular act ion t hat you m ay want t o charact erize you would
have som e num ber of slot s t hat define uh uh uh you know in som e way
what t his act ion is all about .
m n036 [ s] : It can be eit her A , B or C .
m n036 [ qr^ rt ] : Um . So is it a fixed num ber or [ disfm arker] or do you
leav e it open [ disfm arker] it could be bet ween one and fift een
m n036 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m n036 [ s] : it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s flexible .
m n015 [ fh] : Um , t he uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : Well , it sort of depends on [ disfm arker] on if you act ually
writ e down t he [ disfm arker] t he schem a
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : t hen y ou have t o say it ’s eit her one of t hem
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : or it can be none ,
m n015 [ s] : or it can be any of t hem .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : However t he uh [ disfm arker] it seem s t o be sensible t o
m e t o r t o v iew t hem as m ut ually exclusive
m n015 [ fh] : um
m n015 [ s^ am ] : m aybe even not .
fe004 [ qy ^ rt ] : J Do you m ean wit hin t he Source − Pat h − Goal act ions ?
m n036 [ s] : uh [ v ocalsound] ye uh uh b I uh I [ disfm arker] u I
underst and
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Those t hree ?
m n036 [ fh] : uh
m n036 [ %−] : but [ disfm arker]

m n015 [ qh] : And um how [ disfm arker] how where is t he end ?
m n015 [ s.%−] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m n036 [ s^ ar] : No , no .
m n036 [ s] : There [ disfm arker] a a act ually by I t hink m y quest ion is
sim pler t han t hat ,
m n036 [ fh|qy .%−] : um [ vocalsound] is [ disfm arker]
m n036 [ s] : OK , so you have an SPG act ion
m n036 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and it has t hree different um uh aspect s
m n036 [ fh] : um
m n036 [ s] : because you can eit her ent er a building or view it or
[ disfm arker] or approach it and t ouch it or som et hing .
m n036 [ fh|s] : Um now you define uh anot her act ion ,
m n015 [ s] : Forced act ion or forced m ot ion .
m n036 [ s] : it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s called um uh s S P G − one
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n036 [ s] : act ion
m n036 [ fh|s] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n036 [ s] : a different act ion . Um and t his [ disfm arker] uh act ion −
t wo would have v arious variable possibilit ies of int erpret ing what you

m e003 [ fg] : Oh t he [ disfm arker] OK
m n036 [ %−] : So , h

m e003 [ s^ bd^ no] : I don’t know if I ’m gonna answer your quest ion or
not wit h t his ,
m e003 [ s.%−−] : but t he cat egories inside of act ion schem as ,
m e003 [ s] : so , SPG act ion is a cat egory .
m e003 [ %−−] : Real
m e003 [ s] : alt hough I t hink what we ’re specifying here is t his is a
cat egory where t he act ions " ent er , view and approach " would fall
int o
m e003 [ s^ df] : because t hey have a relat ed Source − Pat h − Goal

m e003 [ s^ df.%−] : Cuz viewing in a t ourist dom ain is going up t o it and
[ disfm arker] or act ually going from one place t o anot her t o t ake a

m n036 [ b] : Right .

m e045 [ qw] : And what are som e t y pes of t hat ?
m e045 [ s] : And an Ent er , a View , an Approach .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
m e045 [ s] : Those are all Source − Pat h − Goal act ions .
m e003 [ s] : Inside of Ent er t here will be roles t hat can be filled
basically .
m e003 [ s] : So if I want t o go from out side t o inside [ vocalsound] t hen
y ou ’d have t he roles t hat need t o filled , where you ’d have a Source −
Pat h − Goal set of roles .
m e003 [ s] : So you ’d t he Source would be out side and Pat h is t o t he
door or what ever ,
m e003 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n036 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e003 [ s] : So if you want ed t o have a new t ype of act ion you ’d creat e
a new t y pe of cat egory .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : Then t his cat egory would [ disfm arker] we would put it
[ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ bd] : or not necessarily [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s.%−−] : We would put a new act ion in t he m uh in t he
cat egories t hat [ disfm arker] in which it has t he
m e003 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : Well , every act ion has a set of relat ed schem as
m e003 [ s] : like Source − Pat h − Goal or force , what ever ,
m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n036 [ s^ aa.%] : Right .
m e003 [ s.%−:s.%−] : So we would put " writ e a let t er " in t he cat egories
uh t hat [ disfm arker] in which it had [ disfm arker] it w had uh schem as u
m e045 [ s^ cs] : There could be a com m unicat ion event act ion or
som et hing like t hat
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Exact ly .
m e045 [ s^ cs] : and you could writ e it .
m e003 [ s] : Schem as uh t hat of t hat t ype .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : And t hen lat er , you know , t here [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] we have a com m unicat ion event act ion where we ’d define
it down t here as [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b.%] : Hm m .
fe004 [ s^ bu] : So t here ’s a bit a redundancy ,

fe004 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe004 [ s] : in [ disfm arker] in which t he t hings t hat go int o a part icular
[ disfm arker] You hav e cat egories at t he t op under act ion schem a
fe004 [ s] : and t he t hings t hat go under a part icular cat egory are um
supposed t o have a corresponding schem a definit ion for t hat t ype .
fe004 [ qw] : So I guess what ’s t he funct ion of having it up t here t oo ?
fe004 [ s^ e] : I m ean I guess I ’m wondering whet her [ disfm arker] You
could just have
fe004 [ s] : under act ion schem a you could just sort of say what ever
y ou know it ’s gonna be Ent er , View or Approach or what ever num ber
of t hings
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ df] : and pos part ly because y ou need t o know som ewhere
t hat t hose t hings fall int o som e cat egories .
fe004 [ s] : And it m ay be m ult iple cat egories as you say which is um
t he reason why it get s a lit t le m essy
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : um but if it has [ disfm arker] if it ’s supposed t o be
cat egorized in cat egory X t hen t he corresponding schem a X will be
am ong t he st ruct ures t hat [ disfm arker] t hat follow .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s] : Well , t his is one of t hings we were arguing about .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : That ’s like [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s.%−] : t h t his is [ disfm arker] t his r
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK ,

m n015 [ s] : t his is [ disfm arker] t his is m ore [ disfm arker] t his is

fe004 [ s.%−] : You didn’t t ell m e t o [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s.%−] : also for a while [ disfm arker] for

fe004 [ s] : But now you guys have seen t he light .
m n015 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : No , no , no . Uh we have not [ disfm arker] we

fe004 [ fh] : So .
m e003 [ s^ ar] : No .
fe004 [ s] : I it ’s easy t o go back and fort h
m e003 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he reason [ disfm arker] One reason we

Ent er act ion t hat ’s not capt ured by t he schem as ,

fe004 [ b] : Right .

fe004 [ fg] : Right .
m e003 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe004 [ s] : Which is why I would t hink you would say Ent er

t o Ent er .
fe004 [ s] : And t hen t he t hings t hat are abst ract will be in t he abst ract

fe004 [ s] : And t hat ’s why t he bindings becom e useful .
m e003 [ fg|%−] : Right , but [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Ri − You ’d like [ disfm arker] so you ’re saying
y ou could pract ically t urn t his st ruct ure inside out ?
m e045 [ qrr] : or som et hing ,

m n015 [ s^ ar|s.%−] : No basically w

m n015 [ s^ cs] : Get [ disfm arker] get rid of t he sort of SPG slash
som et hing
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n015 [ s^ cs^ e] : uh or t he sub − act ions cat egory ,
m n015 [ qh] : because what does t hat t ell us ?
fe004 [ b^ rt ] : Uh − huh .
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : Um and I agree t hat y ou know t his is som et hing we need
t o discuss ,
fe004 [ s.%−−] : I in fact what you could say is for Ent er ,
m n015 [ b] : yeah .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : you could say " here , list all t he kinds of schem as t hat
[ disfm arker] on t he cat egory t hat [ disfm arker]
m e045 [ s^ 2^ cs] : List all t he parent cat egories .
fe004 [ %−] : y ou know i

fe004 [ s] : It ’s just like a fram e hierarchy ,
fe004 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e045 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ e] : like y ou have t hese blended fram es .
m n015 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ cs] : So you would say ent er and you ’d say m y parent fram es
are such − and − such ,
fe004 [ s] : h and t hen t hose are t he ones t hat act ually you t hen

m e045 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right ?

m e045 [ %−] : Again [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ aa|s^ df.%−−] : Yes because nobod no t he m odules don’t
[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .

m n015 [ s] : Now t he [ disfm arker] t he reason for [ disfm arker] for not

m n036 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ e] : like , t his [ disfm arker] t he c you know , short version ,
fe004 [ %−−] : like [ disfm arker]
m n036 [ s^ cs^ t ^ t c] : An − and I would like t o second Keit h ’s request .

on Friday
m e003 [ s] : and he can weigh in as well .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ fg|s] : and um if you can get t hat binding point also m aybe
wit h a nice ex am ple t hat would be helpful for Johno and m e .
fe004 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : Oh yeah
fe004 [ %−] : uh
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s.%−] : let ’s uh yeah t hey ’re [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s.%−] : Give us [ disfm arker]
fe046 [ s^ ba] : No problem ,
m e045 [ s^ bu] : I t hink you ’ve got one on hand ,

m e045 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : huh ?
fe046 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
fe004 [ s] : I have sev eral in m y head ,
fe004 [ b] : y eah .
fe004 [ s] : Alway s t hinking about binding .
m n015 [ s] : Well t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he binding is
t echnically no problem
m n015 [ s] : but it ’s [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] for m e it seem s t o be
concept ually im port ant t hat we find out if we can s if [ disfm arker] if
t here [ disfm arker] if t here are t hings in t here t hat are sort of a
general nat ure ,
m n015 [ s^ cs] : we should dist ill t hem out
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ cs^ e] : and put t hem where t he schem as are .
m n015 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : If t here are t hings t hat you know are int ent ion −
specific , t hen we should put t hem up som ewhere ,
fe004 [ s] : So , in general t hey ’ll be bindings across bot h int ent ions
and t he act ions .
m n015 [ s.%−] : a
m n015 [ b] : Yep .
fe004 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ ba] : That ’s wonderful .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : So it ’s gen it ’s general across all of t hese t hings
fe004 [ s] : it ’s like [ disfm arker] I m ean Shast ri would say you know
binding is like [ vocalsound] an essent ial cognit ive uh process .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ fh] : So . [ vocalsound] Um .
m n015 [ b] : OK .
fe004 [ s] : So I don’t t hink it will be isolat ed t o one or t he t wo ,
fe004 [ s.%−−] : but y ou can definit ely figure out where [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ fh|s.%−−] : Yeah , som et im es t hings belong and [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−−] : So act ually I ’m not sure [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : I would be curious t o see how separat e t he int ent ion part
and t he act ion part are in t he syst em .
fe004 [ s] : Like I know t he whole t hing is like int ent ion lat t ice , or
som et hing like t hat ,
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
fe004 [ s^ bu] : So is t he ri right now are t he ideas t he rich [ disfm arker]
rich t he RAD or what ever is one you know pot ent ial block inside
int ent ion .
fe004 [ s^ bu] : It ’s st ill [ disfm arker] it ’s st ill m ainly int ent ion
hypot hesis
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

fe004 [ s^ bu] : and t hen t hat ’s just one way t o describe t he
[ disfm arker] t he act ion part of it .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ %−−] : It ’s [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ bs] : It ’s an a at t em pt t o refine it basically .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : And yeah ,
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK , great uh − huh .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : it ’s an [ disfm arker] an [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it
’s sort of [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ 2^ bu] : Not just t hat y ou want t o go from here t o here ,
fe004 [ s] : it ’s t hat t he act ion is what you int end
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : and t his act ion consist s of all com com plicat ed m odules
and im age schem as and what ever .
fe004 [ fh] : So .
m n015 [ fg|s] : Yeah . And [ disfm arker] and t here will be a [ disfm arker]
a [ disfm arker] a relat ively high lev el of redundancy
m n015 [ s.%−−] : in t he sense t hat um ult im at ely one [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ %−−] : which is ,
fe004 [ s^ ba] : yeah , It ’s fine
m n015 [ s:s] : so t h so t hat if we want t o get really cocky we we will say
" well if y ou really look at it , y ou just need our RAD . "
m n015 [ s] : You can t hrow t he rest away ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n015 [ s^ df] : Because you ’re not gonna get anym ore inform at ion
out of t he act ion a as you find it t here in t he dom ain object .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : But t hen again um in t his case , t he dom ain object m ay
cont ain inform at ion t hat we don’t really care about eit her .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ fh] : So .
m n015 [ s] : H But w we ’ll see t hat t hen , and how [ disfm arker] how it
sort of ev olves .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : I m ean if [ disfm arker] if people really like our
[ disfm arker] our RAD ,
m n015 [ s] : I m ean w what m ight happen is t hat t hey will get rid of t hat
act ion t hing com plet ely ,
m n015 [ s.%−] : you know , and leave it up for us t o get t he parser input
um

fe004 [ fg|s^ bu] : Mm m . We know t he t hings t hat m ake use of t his
t hing so t hat we can just change t hem so t hat t hey m ake use of RAD .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : I can’t believe we ’re using t his t erm .
fe046 [ s^ cs] : You don’t have t o use t he acronym .
fe004 [ s^ j] : So I ’m like RAD !
fe004 [ s^ ba] : Like every t im e I say it , it ’s horrible .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s] : I see what you m ean .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s^ ba] : RAD ’s a great t erm .
fe004 [ qy .%−] : Is t he [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qw] : But what is t he " why " ?
m e045 [ s] : It ’s rad , even !
m e003 [ qw^ br^ m ] : Why ?
fe004 [ qw^ r] : Why ?
m e045 [ s] : It happened t o c be what it st ands for .
m n015 [ %−] : Well [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : It just happened t o be t he acronym .
fe004 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah . That ’s [ disfm arker] doesn’t m ake it a great
t erm .
fe004 [ s] : It ’s just like t hose jokes where you have t o work on bot h
lev els .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : y e no but i
fe046 [ s^ cs] : Just t hink of it as [ disfm arker] as " wheel " in Germ an .
fe004 [ qy ^ rt ] : Do you see what I m ean ?
m n015 [ s] : but if y ou [ disfm arker] if you [ disfm arker] if you work in t h
in t hat XML com m unit y it is a great acronym
fe004 [ %−] : Like
m n015 [ s^ df.%−−] : because it e ev okes what ever RDF [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n015 [ s] : RDF is t he biggest t hing
m n015 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : That ’s t he rich [ disfm arker] sort of " Resource
Descript ion Fram ework "
m e045 [ s^ bk|s.%−] : Oh " rich de "
fe004 [ b] : Oh .
m n015 [ fh|%−] : and um [ disfm arker] and also [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ ba] : So , descript ion , having t he word d t erm " descript ion

fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ ba] : uh " rich " is also great ,
m n015 [ %] : rwww .
m e012 [ b] : Hm m .
m e003 [ qw.%−] : Who doesn’t like t o be a

m e045 [ s^ ba] : Ev erybody likes act ion .
