m e003 [ z] : No , she t old m e a long t im e ago . She t old m e [ disfm arker]
she t old m e like t wo weeks ago .

fn050 [ z] : What is it ?
m e003 [ z] : Let m e ex plain som et hing t o you .
fn050 [ z] : Um ,
m e003 [ z] : My laugh is bet t er t han yours .
fn050 [ z] : t here .
m n015 [ z] : Yo .
fe004 [ z] : I beg t o differ .
fn050 [ z] : Um , OK .
fe004 [ z] : But y ou have t o say som et hing genuinely funny before you ’ll
get an ex am ple .
m e003 [ z] : Yeah .
fn050 [ z] : The t hing is I don’t know how t o get t o t he next page . Here
.
m e003 [ z] : No .
m e003 [ z] : You should be [ disfm arker] at least be self − sat isfied
enough t o laugh at y our own jokes .
fn050 [ z] : Act ually I t hought [ disfm arker]
fn050 [ z] : There .
fe004 [ z] : No , it ’s a different laugh .
fn050 [ z] : How weird .
fe004 [ z] : Ooh , wow !
m e003 [ z] : Oh ! Holy m ackerel .
fe004 [ z] : Wow . Whoa !
fn050 [ z] : What ? !
fn050 [ z] : Oh .
fn050 [ z] : OK . I
fn050 [ z] : wasn’t even doing anyt hing . [ v ocalsound] OK .
fe004 [ z] : Uh .
m e003 [ z] : Eva ’s got a lapt op , she ’s t rying t o show it off .
fn050 [ z] : That was r act ually Robert ’s idea . But anyhow .
fn050 [ z] : Um
m e010 [ fg|s^ t ^ t c] : O K . So , here we are .
m e003 [ s^ 2] : Once again .
m e010 [ s^ m ] : Once again ,

m e010 [ s^ aa] : right ,
m e010 [ s] : t oget her .
m e010 [ fh|s] : Um , so we haven’t had a m eet ing for a while ,
m e010 [ s^ e] : and [ disfm arker] and probably won’t have one next
week ,
m e010 [ s^ df] : I t hink a num ber of people are gone .
m e010 [ fh|qh^ co^ t ] : Um , so Robert , why don’t you bring us up t o
dat e on where we are wit h EDU ?
m n015 [ h] : Um ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : uh in a [ disfm arker] in a sm aller group we had uh ,
t alked and decided about cont inuat ion of t he dat a collect ion .
m n015 [ s] : So Fey ’s t im e wit h us is alm ost officially over ,
m n015 [ fh|s] : and she brought us som e t hirt y subject s and , t

m n015 [ s] : and t en dialogues hav e been t ranscribed
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : and can be looked at .
m n015 [ s^ co^ rt ] : If you ’re int erest ed in t hat , t alk t o m e .
m n015 [ fh|s] : Um , and we found anot her uh , cogsci st udent who ’s
int erest ed in playing wizard for us .
m n015 [ s] : Here we ’re gonna m ake it a lit t le bit m ore com plicat ed for
t he subject s , uh t his round .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : She ’s act ually suggest ed t o look um , at t he
psy chology depart m ent st udent s ,
m n015 [ s^ df] : because t hey have t o part ake in t wo experim ent s in
order t o fulfill som e requirem ent s .
m n015 [ s^ df^ e] : So t hey hav e t o be subject ed , [ vocalsound]
[ com m ent ] before t hey can act ually graduat e .
m n015 [ fh] : And um ,
m n015 [ s] : we want t o design it so t hat t hey really have t o t hink about
having som e t im e ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : t wo days , for exam ple ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : t o plan cert ain t hings and figure out which can be done
at what t im e ,
m n015 [ fh] : and ,
m n015 [ fh|s^ e] : um , sort of package t he whole t hing in a
[ disfm arker] in a re in a few m ore com plicat ed um , st ruct ure .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : That ’s for t he dat a collect ion .
m n015 [ s] : As for Sm art Kom , I ’m [ disfm arker] t he last Sm art Kom
m eet ing I m ent ioned t hat we have som e problem s wit h t he synt hesis ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : which as of t his m orning should be resolved .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : Good .
m n015 [ fh] : And , so ,
m n015 [ s:s] : " should be " m eans t hey aren’t yet ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : but [ disfm arker] but I t hink I have t he info now t hat I
need .
m n015 [ s] : Plus , Johno and I are m eet ing t om orrow ,

m n015 [ s^ am ] : so m aybe uh uh , when t om orrow is over , we ’re done
.
m n015 [ s] : And ha n hav we ’ll never have t o look at it again
m n015 [ s^ am ] : Maybe it ’ll t ake som e m ore t im e ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : t o be realist ic ,
m n015 [ s] : but at least we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re seeing t he end of
t he t unnel t here .
m n015 [ s^ rt ^ t c] : That was t hat .
m n015 [ fh] : Um ,
m n015 [ %−−] : t he uh ,
m n015 [ fh|s] : uh I don’t t hink we need t o discuss t he form alism
m n015 [ s^ df^ rt ] : t hat ’ll be done officially s once we ’re done .
m n015 [ fh] : Um ,
m n015 [ s] : som et hing happened , in [ disfm arker] on Eva ’s side wit h
t he PRM t hat we ’re gonna look at t oday ,
m n015 [ fh] : and um ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : we have a visit or from Bruchsal from t he Int ernat ional
Univ ersit y .
m n015 [ s] : Andreas , I t hink you ’ve m et every one except Nancy .
fe004 [ fg] : Sorry .
m n059 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : Hi . Hi .
m n015 [ s^ m ] : Hi . Hi .
m n015 [ fh] : And , um ,
fe004 [ s] : So when you said " Andreas " I t hought you were t alking
about St olcke .
fe004 [ s] : Now I know t hat we aren’t ,
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ bu] : Andy , you act ually go by Andy ,
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n059 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n059 [ s] : Cuz t here is anot her Andreas around ,
m n015 [ fh.%] : Eh [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Hm m .
m n059 [ s] : so , t o avoid som e confusion .
m n015 [ qy^ bu^ rt ] : That will be [ pause] Reut er ?
m n059 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n015 [ s] : So m y scient ific direct or of t he EML is also t he dean of t he
Int ernat ional Univ ersit y ,
m n015 [ s] : one of his m any occupat ions t hat just cont ribut es t o t he
fact t hat he is v ery occupied .
m n015 [ fh] : And , um ,
m n015 [ %−−] : t he [ disfm arker]

m n015 [ fh|s^ t ] : um , he @ @ m ight t ell us a lit t le bit about what he ’s
act ually doing ,
m n015 [ s] : and why it is s som ewhat relat ed ,
m n015 [ s^ df] : and [ disfm arker] by uh using m aybe som e of t he sam e
t echnologies t hat we are using .
m n015 [ fh|qy ^ rt ] : And um . Was t hat enough of an updat e ?
m e010 [ s^ aa] : I t hink so .
m n015 [ qy^ t ^ t c] : In what order shall we proceed ?
fn050 [ s] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ cs.%−−] : Maybe you have y our on − line [ disfm arker]
fn050 [ h] : Uh ,
fn050 [ s^ aa] : y eah , sure .
fn050 [ fg|s.%−−] : Um , so , I ’ve be just been looking at , um ,
fn050 [ s^ fe] : Ack !
fn050 [ qh] : What are you doing ?
fn050 [ b] : Yeah .
fn050 [ fh] : OK .
fn050 [ fh] : Um ,
fn050 [ s] : I ’v e been looking at t he PRM st uff .
fn050 [ fh] : Um ,
fn050 [ s] : so , t his is , sort of like t he lat est t hing I have on it ,
fn050 [ fh] : and
fn050 [ s] : I sort a const ruct ed a couple of classes .
fn050 [ s^ e] : Like , a user class , a sit e class , and [ disfm arker] and
y ou know , a t im e , a rout e , and t hen [ disfm arker] and a query class .
fn050 [ s] : And I t ried t o sim plify it down a lit t le bit ,
fn050 [ s^ df] : so t hat I can act ually um , look at it m ore .
fn050 [ s] : It ’s t he sam e paper t hat I gave t o Jerry last t im e .
fn050 [ fh] : Um ,
fn050 [ s] : so basically I t ook out a lot of st uff , a lot of t he decision
nodes ,
fn050 [ s.%−−] : and t hen t ried t o [ disfm arker]
fn050 [ s] : The red lines on t he , um , graph are t he um , relat ions
bet ween t he different um , classes .
fn050 [ s] : Like , a user has like , a query ,
fn050 [ s] : and t hen , also has , you know um , reference slot s t o it s
preferences ,
fn050 [ fh|s^ e] : um , t he special needs and , you know , m oney , and
t he user int erest .
fn050 [ fh] : And so
fn050 [ s] : t his is m ore or less sim ilar t o t he flat Bayes − net t hat I have
, you know , wit h t he input nodes and all t hat .
fn050 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
fn050 [ s] : So I t ried t o const ruct t he dependency m odels ,
fn050 [ fh] : and
fn050 [ s^ rt ] : a lot of t hese st uff I got from t he flat Bayes − net ,

fn050 [ s^ e^ rt ] : and what t hey depend on ,
fn050 [ s^ df] : and it t urns out , you know , t he CPT ’s are really big , if I
do t hat ,
fn050 [ s] : so I t ried t o see how I can do , um [ disfm arker] put in t he
com put at ional nodes in bet ween .
fn050 [ s^ e] : And what t hat would look like in a PRM .
fn050 [ s] : And so I ended up m aking several classes [ disfm arker]
fn050 [ s^ bc] : Act ually , you know , a class of [ disfm arker] wit h
different at t ribut es t hat are t he int erm ediat e nodes ,
fn050 [ s^ e] : and one of t hem is like , t im e affordabilit y m oney
affordabilit y , sit e av ailabilit y , and t he t rav el com pat ibilit y .
fn050 [ s.%−−] : And so som e of t hese classes are [ disfm arker]
fn050 [ s^ rt ] : s som e of t hese at t ribut es only depend on st uff from ,
say , t he user ,
fn050 [ s^ e] : or s f just from , I don’t know , like t he sit e .
fn050 [ s] : S like , um , t hese here ,
fn050 [ s^ e] : it ’s only like , user ,
fn050 [ s] : but , if y ou look at t rav el com pat ibilit y for each of t hese
fact ors , you need t o look at a pair of , you know , what t he um ,
preference of t he user is
fn050 [ s^ e] : versus , you know , what t ype of an event it is ,
fn050 [ s^ e] : or y ou know , which form of t ransport at ion t he user has
fn050 [ s^ e] : and whet her , you know , t he onsit e parking m at t ers t o
t he user , in t hat case .
fn050 [ fh|s] : And t hat m akes t he scenario a lit t le different in a PRM ,
fn050 [ s^ df] : because , um , t hen y ou have one − user object s
fn050 [ s] : and pot ent ially you can hav e m any different sit es in
[ disfm arker] in m ind .
fn050 [ fh] : And so
fn050 [ s] : for each of t he sit e you ’ll com e up wit h t his rat ing , of t ravel
com pat ibilit y .
fn050 [ fh|s] : And , t hey all depend on t he sam e users , but different
sit es ,
fn050 [ s.%−−] : and t hat m akes a [ disfm arker]
fn050 [ s] : I ’m t r I w I wa have been t rying t o see whet her t he PRM
would m ake it m ore efficient if we do inferencing like t hat .
fn050 [ fh] : And so ,
fn050 [ s] : I guess you end up hav ing fewer num ber of nodes t han in a
flat Bay es − net ,
fn050 [ s^ df.%−−] : cuz ot herwise you would [ disfm arker] c
fn050 [ s] : well , it ’s probably t he sam e .
fn050 [ fh] : But um ,
fn050 [ s.%−−] : No , you would definit ely have [ disfm arker]
fn050 [ s^ bc] : be able t o re − use , like , [ vocalsound] um , all t he user
st uff ,

fn050 [ s] : and not [ disfm arker] not having t o recom put e a lot of t he
st uff ,
fn050 [ s^ df] : because it ’s all from t he user side .
fn050 [ s] : So if y ou changed sit es , you [ disfm arker] you can , you
know , sav e som e work on t hat .
fn050 [ fh] : But ,
fn050 [ s] : y ou know , in t he case where , it depends on bot h t he user
and t he sit e , t hen I ’m st ill having a hard t im e t rying t o see how um ,
using t he PRM will help .
fn050 [ fh|s] : Um , so anyhow , using t hose int erm ediat e nodes t hen ,
t his [ disfm arker] t his would be t he class t hat represent t he
int erm ediat e nodes .
fn050 [ s] : And t hat would [ disfm arker] basically it ’s just anot her class
in t he m odel ,
fn050 [ s^ e] : wit h , you know , references t o t he user and t he sit e and
t he t im e .
fn050 [ s.%−−] : And t hen , aft er you group t hem t oget her t his
[ disfm arker]
fn050 [ s] : no t he dependencies would [ disfm arker] of t he queries
would be reduced t o t his .
fn050 [ s] : And so , y ou know , it ’s easier t o specify t he CPT and all .
fn050 [ fh|s] : Um , so I t hink t hat ’s about as far as I ’ve gone on t he
PRM st uff .
m e010 [ s^ ar.%−−] : Well
fn050 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ ar^ rt ] : No .
m e010 [ s^ df] : So y you didn’t yet t ell us what t he out put is .
fn050 [ s^ m ] : The out put .
m e010 [ qw] : So what decisions does t his m ake ?
fn050 [ fg|s] : OK . So it only m akes t wo decisions , in t his m odel .
fn050 [ s] : And one is basically how desirable a sit e is
fn050 [ s^ e] : m eaning , um , how good it m at ches t he needs of a user
.
fn050 [ s] : And t he ot her is t he m ode of t he visit ,
fn050 [ s^ e] : whet her t h It ’s t he EVA decision .
fn050 [ fh] : Um ,
fn050 [ s^ cc^ rt ] : so , inst ead of um , [ v ocalsound] doing a lot of , you
know , com put at ion about , you know , which one sit e it want s of
[ disfm arker] t he user want s t o visit , I ’ll com e [ disfm arker] well , t ry t o
com e up wit h like , sort of a list of sit es .
fn050 [ s] : And for each sit e , y ou know , where [ disfm arker] h how
[ disfm arker] how well it fit s ,
fn050 [ s] : and basically a rat ing of how well it fit s and what t o do wit h
it .
fn050 [ fh] : So .
fn050 [ qy ^ t ] : Any t hing else I m issed ?

m e010 [ s] : So t hat was pret t y quick .
m e010 [ s] : She ’s ac uh uh Eva ’s got a lit t le writ e − up on it
m e010 [ s] : t hat uh , probably gives t he [ disfm arker] t he det ails t o
anybody who needs t hem .
m e010 [ fh] : Um ,
m e010 [ fh] : so
m e010 [ qy^ bu^ d] : t he [ disfm arker] You [ disfm arker] you didn’t look at
all y et t o see if t here ’s anybody has a im plem ent at ion .
fn050 [ s^ aa] : No , not yet ,
fn050 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So one [ disfm arker] so one of t he quest ions , you know
, about t hese P R Ms is
fn050 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ h|s^ cc] : uh , we aren’t gonna build our own int erpret er ,
m e010 [ s^ cs] : so if [ disfm arker] if we can’t find one , t hen we uh , go
off and do som et hing else and wait unt il s one appears .
m e010 [ fh|s] : Uh , so one of t he t hings t hat Eva ’s gonna do over t he
next few weeks is see if we can t rack t hat down .
m e010 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e010 [ s] : t he people at St anford writ e papers as if t hey had one ,
m e010 [ fh|s^ am ] : but , um , we ’ll see .
m e010 [ s] : So w Anyway . So t hat ’s a [ disfm arker] a m ajor open issue
.
m e010 [ s] : If t here is an int erpret er , it looks like you know , what Eva
’s got should run
m e010 [ s] : and we should be able t o act ually um , t ry t o solve , you
know , t he problem s ,
m e010 [ s^ e] : t o act ually t ake t he dat a , and do it .
m e010 [ fh|s^ am ] : Uh , and we ’ll see .
m e010 [ s] : Uh , I act ually t hink it is cleaner ,
m e010 [ s] : and t he abilit y t o inst ant iat e , y ou know , inst ance of
people and sit es and st uff , um , will help in t he expression .
m e010 [ s^ no] : Whet her t he inference get s any fast er or not I don’t
know .
m e010 [ s] : Uh , it wouldn’t surprise m e if it [ disfm arker] if it doesn’t .
fn050 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : You know , it ’s t he sam e kind of inform at ion .
m e010 [ s] : I t hink t here are t hings t hat y ou can express t his way
which y ou can’t express in a norm al belief − net ,
m e010 [ fh|s^ e] : uh , wit hout going t o som e incredible hacking
m e010 [ s^ e] : of [ disfm arker] sort of rebuilding it on t he fly .
m e010 [ s] : I m ean , t he not ion of inst ant iat ing your el elem ent s from
t he ont ology and st uff fit s t his v ery nicely and doesn’t fit very well int o
t he ex t ended belief − net .
m e010 [ s^ df] : So t hat was one of t he m ain reasons for doing it .

m e010 [ fh] : Um .
m e010 [ s^ t c] : I don’t know .
m e010 [ fh|s.%−−] : So , uh , people who have t hought about t he
problem , like Robert
m e010 [ s^ cs] : i it looked t o m e like if [ com m ent ] Eva were able t o
com e up wit h a [ vocalsound] y ou know , value for each of a num ber of
uh , sit es plus it s EVA t hing ,
m e010 [ s^ e] : t hat a t ravel planner should be able t o t ake it from
t here .
m e010 [ fh|s] : And [ disfm arker] you know , wit h som e ot her inform at ion
about how m uch t im e t he person has and what ever ,
m e010 [ s] : and t hen plan a rout e .
m n015 [ s] : Um − hm m , um , [ vocalsound] well , first of all uh , uh ,
great looks , m u m uch cleaner ,
m n015 [ %] : nnn , nnn ,
m n015 [ s] : Cert ain [ disfm arker] cert ain beaut y in it ,
m n015 [ s] : so , um , if beaut y is t rut h , t hen , uh we ’re in good shape
.
m n015 [ fh] : But ,
m n015 [ %−−] : t he um ,
m n015 [ s^ cs] : as , uh , m ent ioned before we probably should look at
t t he det ails .
m n015 [ s] : So if you have a writ e − up t hen uh , I ’d love t o read it
fn050 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ fh] : and uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s.%−−] : because , um ,
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ] : i Can you go all t he way back t o t he [ disfm arker] t he
v ery t op ?
fn050 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ fh|qy^ rt ] : Um , [ vocalsound] uh t hese [ disfm arker] @ @
[ com m ent ] t hese [ disfm arker] w w when t hese are inst ant iat ed t hey
t ake on t he sam e values ? t hat we had before ?
fn050 [ s^ t 3] : I can’t really see t he whole t hing .
m n015 [ qrr] : or are t hey [ disfm arker] have t hey changed , in a sense ?
fn050 [ s] : Well I t hink I basically leav e t hem t o sim ilar t hings .
m n015 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fn050 [ s] : Som e of t he t hings m ight [ disfm arker] t hat m ight be
different , m aybe like [ disfm arker] are t hat t he hours for t he sit e .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
fn050 [ fh|s] : And , event ually I m eant t hat t o m ean whet her t hey ’re
open at t his hour or not .
fn050 [ s:s] : And st at us would be , y ou know , m ore or less like ,
whet her t hey ’re under const ruct ion ,
m n015 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fn050 [ fh|s] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] or st uff like t hat .

m n015 [ s] : And t he , uh , ot her quest ion I would have is t hat
presum ably , from t he way t he St anford people t alk about it , you can
put t he probabilit ies also on t he relat ions .
m n015 [ %−] : If [ disfm arker]
fn050 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : Which is t he st ruct ural uncert aint y ?
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ fg|%−−] : Yeah , I [ disfm arker] t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : That I t hink was act ually in t he previous [ disfm arker] t he
Ubent h st uff .
m e010 [ s^ no] : I don’t rem em ber whet her t hey carried t hat over t o
t his or not ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ fh|s] : uh , st ruct ural uncert aint y .
m n015 [ s] : It ’s sort of in t he definit ion or [ disfm arker] in t he
[ disfm arker] in Daphne ’s definit ion of a PRM
m n015 [ s^ e] : is t hat classes and relat ions ,
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ e] : and you ’re gonna have CPT ’s over t he classes and
t heir relat ions .
m e010 [ fg] : Alright .
m n015 [ s.%−] : More uncert aint y , or [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ fh] : Uh ,
fn050 [ s] : I rem em ber t hem learning when , you know , you don’t know
t he st ruct ure for sure ,
m n015 [ s.%−] : I should say .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
fn050 [ s^ no] : but I don’t rem em ber reading how you specify
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s] : Yeah , t hat would be exact ly m y quest ion .
fn050 [ s^ e] : wh t o st art wit h .
fn050 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ fh] : Well [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
fn050 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ cc] : So , uh , t he [ disfm arker] t he plan is [ disfm arker] is
when Daphne get s back , we ’ll get in t ouch
m e010 [ s] : and supposedly , um , we ’ll act ually get s deep
[ disfm arker] seriously connect ed t o [ disfm arker] t o t heir work
m e010 [ fh] : and
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e010 [ s^ cs] : som ebody ’ll [ disfm arker] Uh , you know [ disfm arker] If
it ’s a group m eet ing once a week probably som eone ’ll go down and ,
what ev er .
m e010 [ s^ cc] : So , we ’ll act ually figure all t his out .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : OK .

m n015 [ s] : Then I t hink t he w [ vocalsound] long t erm perspect ive is
[ disfm arker] is pret t y clear .
m n015 [ s^ co] : We get rocking and rolling on t his again , once we get
a package ,
m n015 [ s^ e:qw] : if , when , and how ,
m n015 [ s] : t hen t his becom es foregrounded
fn050 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ e] : profiled ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : focused , again .
m e003 [ qy^ rt ] : Designat ed ?
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Of course .
m n015 [ fh] : And um ,
m n015 [ s^ cc^ rt ] : unt il t hen we ’ll com e up wit h a som et hing t hat ’s
[ disfm arker] @ @ [ com m ent ] t hat ’s way m ore com plicat ed for you .
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
fn050 [ s^ aa] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ df] : Because t his was laughingly easy ,
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fn050 [ s^ ng] : Act ually I had t o t ake out a lot of t he com plicat ed st uff ,
fn050 [ s^ df] : cuz I [ disfm arker] I m ade it really com plicat ed in t he
beginning ,
fn050 [ fh|s:s] : and Jerry was like , [ vocalsound] " t his is just t oo m uch "
.
m e010 [ fg] : Yeah . So , um ,
m e010 [ s^ cs] : you could , from t his , go on and say suppose t here ’s
a group of people t raveling t oget her
m e010 [ fh|s.%−] : and you want ed t o plan som et hing t hat som ehow ,
wit h som e Paret o opt im al uh , [ vocalsound] uh , t hing for [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ ba] : That ’s good .
fe004 [ s^ j] : That ’s definit ely a job for art ificial int elligence .
m e010 [ %−] : uh , or [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ na.%−] : Well t hat ’s not [ disfm arker] not even som et hing
hum ans [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : Except for hum ans can’t really solve it eit her , so .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ cs^ j.%−−] : Well t hat ’s t he [ disfm arker] t hat would
[ disfm arker] t hat would be a [ disfm arker] uh , you could sell it , as a
[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s.%−−:s] : OK , eh you don’t have t o fight about t his , just give
y our preferences t o t he [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : And t hen you can blam e t he com put er .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : w Exact ly .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .

fe004 [ fh] : So .
m n015 [ qw^ j^ rt ] : But what does it [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker] Would
a pot e pot ent ial result be t o [ disfm arker] t o split up and never t alk t o
each ot her again ?
m n015 [ b] : You know .
fe004 [ s^ j^ na] : That should be one of t hem .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Right .
m e003 [ s^ ba] : That ’d be nice .
fe004 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ fg] : Any way .
m e010 [ s] : So . So t here i t here are som e [ disfm arker] som e u uh ,
y ou know , uh , elaborat ions of t his
m e010 [ s^ cs^ e] : t hat you could t ry t o put in t o t his st ruct ure ,
m e010 [ s] : but I don’t t hink it ’s wort h it now .
m e010 [ s^ df] : Because we ’re gonna see what [ disfm arker] what else
uh [ disfm arker] what else we ’re gonna do .
m e010 [ s^ t c] : Any way .
m e010 [ fh] : But uh ,
m e010 [ s^ ba] : it ’s good , yeah
m e010 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and t here were a couple ot her ideas of
[ disfm arker] of uh , t hings for Ev a t o look at
m e010 [ s^ e] : in [ disfm arker] in t he int erim .
m n015 [ fg|s^ t ^ t c] : Good . Then , we can m ove on and see what
Andreas has got out his sleeve .
m n015 [ s^ e] : Or Andy , for t hat m at t er ?
m n059 [ fg|s^ ft ] : OK . So uh , uh , well , t hanks for having m e here ,
first of all .
m n059 [ fh|s] : Um , so m aybe just a [ disfm arker] a lit t le background on
[ disfm arker] on m y visit .
m n059 [ s] : So , uh , I ’m not really involved in any project , t hat ’s uh
[ disfm arker] t hat ’s relevant t o you uh , a at t he m om ent ,
m n059 [ s] : uh , t he [ disfm arker] t he reason is really for m e uh , t o
have an opport unit y t o t alk t o som e ot her researchers in t he field .
m n059 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and so I ’ll just n sort of give you a real
quick int roduct ion t o what I ’m working on ,
m n059 [ fh|s] : and um , I just hope t hat you have som e com m ent s
m n059 [ s] : or , m ay be you ’re int erest ed in it t o find out m ore ,
m n059 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and so I ’ll be uh , happy t o t alk t o you
m n059 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and uh , I ’d also like t o find out som e
m ore
m n059 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and m aybe I ’ll just walk around t he office
m n059 [ fh] : and
m n059 [ s] : and t hen [ disfm arker] and ask som e [ disfm arker] som e
quest ions , uh , in a couple days .

m n059 [ s] : So I ’ll be here for uh , t om orrow and t hen uh , t he
rem ainder of uh , next week .
m n059 [ s] : OK , so , um , what I st art ed looking at , uh , t o begin wit h
is just uh , cont ent m anagem ent syst em s uh , i i in general .
m n059 [ fh] : So
m n059 [ s] : um , uh what ’s uh [ disfm arker] Sort of t he st at e of t he art
t here is t o um [ disfm arker] uh you have a bunch of [ disfm arker] of uh
docum ent s or learning unit s or learning object s ,
m n059 [ s] : um , and you st ore m et a − dat a uh , associat e t o t hem .
m n059 [ s] : So t here ’s som e int ernat ional st andards
m n059 [ s^ e] : like t he I − t riple − E , uh [ disfm arker] There ’s an I − t riple
− E , LON st andard ,
m n059 [ s] : and um , t hese fields are pret t y st raight forward , you have
uh aut hor inform at ion , you hav e uh , size inform at ion , form at
inform at ion and so on .
m n059 [ s] : Uh , but t hey ’re t wo uh fields t hat are um , m ore
int erest ing .
m n059 [ s^ e] : One is uh you st ore keywords associat ed wit h t he uh
[ disfm arker] wit h t he docum ent ,
m n059 [ s^ e.%−−] : and one is uh , you have sort of a , um ,
m n059 [ s] : well , what is t he docum ent about ? So it ’s som e sort of
t ax onom ic uh , ordering of [ disfm arker] of t he [ disfm arker] of t he unit s
.
m n059 [ s] : Now , if you sort of put on your sem ant ic glasses , uh y ou
say , well t hat ’s not all t hat easy ,
m n059 [ s^ df] : because t here ’s an im plicit um , uh , assum pt ion
behind t hat
m n059 [ s^ e] : is t hat uh , all t he users of t his syst em share t he sam e
int erpret at ion of t he keyword and t he sam e int erpret at ion of uh ,
whichev er t ax onom y is used ,
m n059 [ fh] : and uh ,
m n059 [ s] : I t hink t hat ’s a [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a very [ disfm arker] t hat
’s a key point of t hese syst em s
m n059 [ s] : and t hey sort of always brush over t his real quickly wit hout
really elaborat ing m uch of t hat
m n059 [ s] : and uh [ disfm arker] As a m at t er of fact , t he only t hing
t hat m apparent ly really works out so far are library ordering codes ,
m n059 [ s^ e] : which are very , very coarse grain ,
m n059 [ s.%−−] : so y ou have som e like , science , biology , and t hen
[ disfm arker]
m n059 [ s] : But t hat ’s really all t hat we have at t he m om ent .
m n059 [ s] : So I t hink t here ’s a huge , um , uh need for im provem ent
t here .
m n059 [ s] : Now , what t his uh [ disfm arker] a st andard like t his would
giv e us is we could um , sort of uh wit h a search engine just query uh ,
different reposit ories all over t he world .

m n059 [ s.%−−] : But we can’t really [ disfm arker]
m n059 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um , so what I ’m [ disfm arker] what I t ry t o do is um ,
t o hav e um ,
m n059 [ s] : uh [ disfm arker] So . So t he scenario is t he following , you
y ou ’re working on som e sort of project and you encount er a cert ain
problem .
m n059 [ s^ df] : Now , what [ disfm arker] what we have at our universit y
quit e a bit is t hat uh , st udent s um , t ry t o u program a cert ain
assignm ent , for exam ple ,
m n059 [ s^ df^ e] : t hey always run int o t he sam e problem s ,
m n059 [ s^ df^ e] : uh , and t hey always com e running t o us ,
m n059 [ s^ df^ e] : and t hey ’ll say why ’s it not [ disfm arker] it ’s not
working ,
m n059 [ s^ df^ e] : and we alway s give out t he sam e answer ,
m n059 [ s:s] : so we t hought , well , it ’d be nice t o have a syst em t hat
could sort of t ake care of t his ,
m n059 [ s] : and so , what I want t o build is basically a [ disfm arker] a
sm art F A Q sy st em .
m n059 [ s^ co] : Now , what you uh need t o do here is you need t o
prov ide som e cont ext inform at ion
m n059 [ s^ e:s] : which is m ore elaborat e t han " I ’m looking for t his and
t his and t his key word . "
m n059 [ fh] : So .
m n059 [ s] : And I t hink t hat I don’t need t o t ell you t his .
m n059 [ s] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m sure you have t he sam e [ disfm arker]
when [ disfm arker] when som ebody ut t ers a sent ence in a cert ain , uh ,
cont ext
m n059 [ s] : it , and [ disfm arker] and t he sam e sent ence in anot her
cont ext m akes a huge difference .
m n059 [ fh|s^ cs] : So , I want t o be able t o m odel inform at ion like , um ,
so in t he [ disfm arker] in t he cont ext of [ disfm arker] in t he cont ext of
developing dist ribut ed syst em s , of a at a com put er science school ,
m n059 [ fh|s:qw] : um , what kind of soft ware is t he person using ,
m n059 [ s:qw] : which hom ework assignm ent is he or she working on at
t he m om ent ,
m n059 [ s:qw] : um , m aybe what ’s t he background of t hat st udent ’s
m n059 [ fh|s:qw] : um , which um , which error m essage was
encount ered .
m n059 [ s] : So t his sort of inform at ion I t hink should be t ransm it t ed ,
uh , when a cert ain docum ent is ret rieved .
m n059 [ fh] : Now ,
m n059 [ fh] : um ,
m n059 [ s.%−−] : basically giving t his um [ disfm arker] Uh
m n059 [ s^ cs] : so we som ehow need t o have a form alized um , way of
writ ing t his down basically ,

m n059 [ s] : and t hat ’s where t he shared int erpret at ion of [ disfm arker]
of cert ain t erm s and keywords com es in again .
m n059 [ fh|s] : And , using t his and som e [ disfm arker] som e uh ,
knowledge about t he dom ain I t hink you can do som e [ disfm arker]
som e sim ple inferences .
m n059 [ s] : Like y ou know t hat when som ebody ’s working about
[ disfm arker] uh , working on [ disfm arker] on servlet s for exam ple ,
m n059 [ s^ e] : he ’s using Java , cuz servlet s are used [ disfm arker] are
writ t en in Jav a .
m n059 [ s] : So som e [ disfm arker] som e inferences like t hat ,
m n059 [ fh|s] : now , um , u using t his you can infer m ore inform at ion ,
m n059 [ s^ cs] : and you could t hen m at ch t his t o t he m et a − dat a of
um [ disfm arker] off t he docum ent s y ou ’re [ disfm arker] you ’re
searching against .
m n059 [ s^ cs] : So , uh what I wanna do is basically have som e sort of
um [ disfm arker] giv en t hese input s ,
m n059 [ s^ rt ] : and t hen I can com put e how m any docum ent s m at ch ,
m n059 [ s] : and use t his as a m et ric in t he search .
m n059 [ s^ cs] : Now , what I plan t o do is I want t o uh sort of do a uh
[ disfm arker] uh [ pause] t ry t o im prove t he qualit y of t he search result s
,
m n059 [ s] : and I want t o do t his by having a dept h uh , um , um
[ disfm arker] st eepest descent approach .
m n059 [ s:qw] : So if I knew which operat ing syst em t he person was
working on , would t his im prove m y search result ?
m n059 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and having uh , uh a sym bolic form alized
m odel of t his I could sim ply com put e t hat ,
m n059 [ s] : and find out which um [ disfm arker] which quest ions are
wort h um , asking .
m n059 [ s] : And t hat ’s what I t hen propagat e back t o t he user ,
m n059 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and sort of t ry t o opt im ize t he search in
t his way .
m n059 [ s] : Now , t he big problem t hat I ’m facing right now is um , it ’s
fairly easy t o hack up a syst em uh quickly , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat works
in t he sm all dom ain ,
m n059 [ s] : but t he problem is obviously t he scalabilit y .
m n059 [ fh|s] : And uh uh , so Robert was m ent ioning uh , earlier t oday
is t hat uh , Microsoft for exam ple wit h t heir print er set up program has
a Bay esian net work ,
m n059 [ s^ e] : which does exact ly t his ,
m n059 [ s] : but t here you face a problem t hat t hese are very hard t o
ex t end .
m n059 [ s] : And so , uh what I ’m [ disfm arker] What I t ry t o do is
basically t ry t o m odel t his uh , in a way t hat you could really com bine
uh , knowledge from very different sources ,

m n059 [ fh|s] : and [ disfm arker] and um , sort of looking int o som e of
t he ideas t hat t he sem ant ic web com m unit y uh , cam e up wit h .
m n059 [ s] : Try ing t o [ disfm arker] t o have uh , an approach how t o
int egrat e s uh cert ain uh [ disfm arker] represent at ion of cert ain
concept s and also som e com put at ional rules ,
m n059 [ s^ e] : um , what you can do wit h t hose .
m n059 [ fh] : Um .
m n059 [ s] : What I ’m also looking int o is a probabilist ic approach int o
t his
m n059 [ s^ df] : because docum ent ret rievals is a very fuzzy procedure ,
m n059 [ s^ ba] : so it ’s probably not t hat easy t o sim ply have a
sy m bolic uh , com put at ional m odel .
m n059 [ s^ e] : That [ disfm arker] t hat probably isn’t expressive enough
.
m n059 [ s] : So . So t hat ’s anot her t hing ,
m n059 [ s^ rt ] : um , which I t hink you ’re also uh , uh looking int o right
now .
m n059 [ s.%−−] : And t hen um , uh sort of as an add − on t o t his whole
idea , um , uh t hat would be
m n059 [ s^ df] : now , depending on what t he search engine or t he
cont ent reposit ory [ disfm arker] depending on which [ disfm arker] um ,
uh , which uh , rules and which ont ologies it [ disfm arker] it uses , or
basically it s view of t he world , uh you can get very different result s .
m n059 [ s] : So it m ight m a m ake a lot of sense t o act ually query a lot
of different search engines .
m n059 [ s] : And t here you could have an idea where you act ually have
sort of a [ disfm arker] a peer t o peer approach ,
m n059 [ s^ e] : where we ’re all sort of carrying around our individual
bookshelves ,
m n059 [ s] : and um , if you hav e a quest ion about a hom ework , it ’s
[ disfm arker] probably m akes sense t o ask som ebody who ’s in your
class wit h you , sort of t he guru in t he cert ain area ,
m n059 [ s^ e] : rat her t han going t o som e Yahoo − like uh , search
engine .
m n059 [ s] : So t hese are som e of t he [ disfm arker] just in a nut shell ,
som e of t he ideas .
m n059 [ s] : And I t hink a lot of t he [ disfm arker] even t hough it ’s a
[ disfm arker] it ’s a v ery different dom ain , but I t hink a lot of t he , um ,
issues are [ disfm arker] are fairly sim ilar .
m n059 [ fh] : So .
m n059 [ s^ rt ^ t c] : OK .
fe004 [ s] : And so som e of t he [ disfm arker] I don’t know how m uch you
know about t he larger Heidelberg project ,
fe004 [ qy .%−] : I [ disfm arker] Are y ou [ disfm arker]
m n059 [ s] : Uh I know , yeah I know abou about it .

fe004 [ s] : So it seem s like a lot of [ disfm arker] som e of t he issues are
t he sam e .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : It ’s like , um , you know , t he c cont ext − based fact ors
t hat influence how you int erpret ,
m n059 [ b] : Mm − hm m . Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ fh|s.%−−] : um , s how t o int erpret .
fe004 [ s] : In [ disfm arker] in t his case , infer in in knowing [ disfm arker]
want ing t o know what kinds of t hings t o ask .
fe004 [ s] : We − we ’ve kind of t alked about t hat ,
fe004 [ s] : but we haven’t worried t oo m uch about t hat end of t he
discourse .
m n015 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : But m aybe you guys had t hat in t he previous m odels .
m n015 [ s] : Well , in a [ disfm arker] in one [ disfm arker] t one s m m m ,
sm all difference in a [ disfm arker] in a way , is t hat he doesn’t have t o
com e up wit h an answer ,
m n015 [ s.%−] : but he want s t o point t o t he places w w
m n059 [ fg|s] : Yeah , so . So I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m not [ disfm arker] I ’m
not building an ex pert [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ 2] : Docum ent s t hat have t he answers .
m n059 [ s] : Uh , I want t o build a sm art librarian , basically
fe004 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n059 [ s^ e] : t hat can point y ou t o t he right reference .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n059 [ s] : I don’t wanna com put e t he answer ,
m n059 [ s^ ba] : so it ’s a lit t le bit easier for m e .
m n015 [ s^ ng] : Well . Uh , you have t o s st ill m underst and what t he
cont ent says about it self , and t hen m at ch it t o what you t hink t he
inform at ional needs [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n059 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ bu] : So you also don’t have t o figure out what t he cont ent is
.
fe004 [ s^ bu] : You ’re just t aking t he key words as a t opic t ex t ,
m n059 [ s^ na] : I [ disfm arker] I assum e t hat [ disfm arker] t hat t he
t here will be learning syst em s t hat [ disfm arker] t hat t ag t heir
[ disfm arker] t heir cont ent .
fe004 [ %−] : as [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n059 [ fh] : And um , um ,
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Right .

m n059 [ s^ cs] : m @ @ and basically what I [ disfm arker] what I envision
is t hat y ou [ disfm arker] rat her t han just supplying a bunch of keywords
y ou could basically [ disfm arker] for [ disfm arker] for an FAQ for exam ple
y ou could st at e sort of like a logic condit ion , when t his docum ent
applies .
m n059 [ s] : So " t his docum ent explains how t o set up your uh , m ail
account on Linux " or som et hing like t his .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n059 [ s.%−−] : So . So som et hing [ disfm arker] som et hing very specific
t hat y ou can t hen [ disfm arker]
m n059 [ s] : But t he [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat t he key point wit h t hese
uh , learning syst em s is t hat uh , a learning syst em is only as good as
uh t he am ount of cont ent it [ disfm arker] it carries .
fe004 [ b] : Mm m ,
fe004 [ b^ rt ] : m m − hm m .
m n059 [ s] : You can have t he best learning syst em wit h t he best
search int erface ,
m n059 [ s] : if t here ’s no cont ent inside of it , it ’s not very useful .
m n059 [ s] : So I t hink ult im at ely because um , uh developing t hese
[ disfm arker] t hese rules and t hese inference uh [ disfm arker]
inferences I t hink is very cost ly ,
m n059 [ fh|s^ cs] : so um , uh I t hink you m ust be able t o reuse som e
[ disfm arker] som e exist ing um , dom ain [ disfm arker] dom ain
inform at ion , or [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker] or ont ologies t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat uh ot her people wrot e
m n059 [ s^ e] : and t hen t ry t o int egrat e t hem ,
m n059 [ s^ e] : and t hen also search t he ent ire web basically , rat her
t han just t he sm all uh , cont ent m anagem ent syst em .
fe004 [ b] : OK .
fe004 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m n059 [ s.%−] : So I t hink t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s crucial for
[ disfm arker] for t he success of [ disfm arker] or @ @ [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−−] : So , you ’re not [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : I guess I ’m t rying t o figure out how [ disfm arker] how it
m aps t o t he kinds of t hings t hat we ’v e t alked about in t his group , and
, act ually associat ed groups ,
m n059 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ df] : cuz som e of us do pret t y det ailed linguist ic analyses ,
fe004 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : and I ’m guessing t hat you [ disfm arker] you won’t be
doing t hat ?
m n059 [ s^ aa] : No .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ df] : Just checking .
fe004 [ fh] : So , [ vocalsound] OK .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
m n059 [ s^ aa^ r] : No .

fe004 [ s.%−−] : So , you t ake t he query , and [ disfm arker] and
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ cs] : On t he ot her hand , uh , Fram eNet could well be useful
