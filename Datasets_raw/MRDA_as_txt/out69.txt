m e013 [ s] : and Birger Kollm eier will join us .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : and you ’re [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] you ’re
probably gonna go up in a couple [ disfm arker] t hree weeks or so ?
m e013 [ qw^ e] : When d when are y ou t hinking of going up t o , uh , OGI
?
m n007 [ h|s] : Yeah , like , uh , not next week
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : but m aybe t he week aft er .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ ba|s] : Good . So at least we ’ll have one m eet ing wit h
[ v ocalsound] yo wit h you st ill around ,
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ba] : That ’s good .
m n007 [ fg] : Um ,
m n007 [ fg|s^ cs^ t ^ t c] : Yeah . Well , [ v ocalsound] m aybe we can st art

m n007 [ s] : and t he only t opic on t he agenda was just t o discuss
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : a and t o com e at [ disfm arker] uh , t o get a decision
about t his lat ency problem .
m e013 [ s^ ar|qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : No , t his [ disfm arker] I ’m sorry , t his is a
conference call bet ween different Aurora people
m n007 [ s^ aa|s] : Uh , yeah . It ’s t he conference call bet ween t he
Aurora , [ vocalsound] uh , group .
m e013 [ qrr.%−] : or just [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s] : It ’s t he m ain conference call .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ s] : Uh , yeah . There were like t wo hours of [ pause]
discussions ,
m n007 [ s] : and t hen suddenly , [ v ocalsound] uh , people were t ired , I
guess ,
m n007 [ s] : and t hey decided on [ nonvocalsound] a num ber ,
m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : t wo hundred and t went y ,
m n007 [ fh] : um ,

m n007 [ s^ e] : included e including ev eryt hing .
m n007 [ s^ e] : Uh , it m eans t hat it ’s like eight y m illiseconds [ pause]
less t han before .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ qw] : And what are we sit t ing at current ly ?
m n007 [ s] : So , current ly d uh , we have syst em t hat has t wo hundred
and t hirt y .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ ba] : So , t hat ’s fine .
m e013 [ s^ bu^ m ] : Two t hirt y .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So t hat ’s t he syst em t hat ’s described on t he second
point of [ pause] t his [ vocalsound] docum ent .
m e013 [ %−] : So it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu] : we have t o reduce it by t en m illiseconds som ehow .
m n007 [ s^ aa|%−] : Yeah . But t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ ba] : That ’s not a problem , I [ disfm arker] I guess .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : W It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s p d prim ary [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . At t his point ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : S so we can m ake t he VAD a lit t le short er .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
m e013 [ %−] : That ’s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , uh − huh .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Yeah . We probably should do t hat pret t y soon so t hat
we don’t get used t o it being a cert ain way .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ qy] : Was Hari on t he [ disfm arker] on t he phone ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , sure .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ s] : Well , it was m ainly a discussion [ vocalsound] bet ween Hari

m e013 [ s^ bk.%] : OK .
m n007 [ fh] : m m m [ disfm arker]

m n007 [ fg|s^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : Uh , yeah . So , t he second t hing is t he syst em
t hat we have current ly .
m n007 [ s] : Oh , yes . We have , like , a syst em t hat gives sixt y − t wo

m n007 [ s.%−−] : but [ vocalsound] if you want t o st ick t o t he
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] t his lat ency [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Well , it has a lat ency of t wo t hirt y ,
m n007 [ s^ bd] : but [ vocalsound] if y ou want also t o st ick t o t he

[ v ocalsound] t hen we go a lit t le bit down
m n007 [ s^ df] : but it ’s st ill sixt y − one percent .
m n007 [ s] : Uh , and if we drop t he t andem net work , t hen we have fift y

m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Uh , but t h t he t wo t h t wo t hirt y includes t he
t andem net work ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ qy ] : And i is t he t andem net work , uh , sm all enough t hat it will

m n007 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : Uh , no , I don’t t hink so .
m e013 [ s^ e.%−] : in t erm s of [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s^ bk] : No .

m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ s] : It ’s st ill [ disfm arker] in t erm s of com put at ion , if we use ,

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n007 [ s] : but it ’s , uh , m m ainly a problem of m em ory .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s^ no] : and I don’t know how m uch [ pause] t his can be

m n007 [ s] : because it ’s [ disfm arker] it could be in ROM ,

m n007 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw.%−] : Ho − how m uch m em ory d ? H how m any [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ s^ no] : I d I d uh , I [ disfm arker] I don’t kn rem em ber exact ly ,

m n007 [ s^ cc] : Yeah , I c I [ disfm arker] I have t o check t hat .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ na] : Yeah . I ’d like t o [ pause] see t hat ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : cuz m aybe I could t hink a lit t le bit about it ,
m e013 [ s^ am ^ cs] : cuz we [ vocalsound] m aybe we could m ake it a

m e013 [ s^ ba] : or [ disfm arker] I m ean , it ’d be [ disfm arker] it ’d be

m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , I ’d like t o see how far off we are .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : But I guess it ’s st ill wit hin t heir rules t o have
[ disfm arker] hav e it on t he , uh , t uh , server side .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Yeah .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d.%−−] : And t his is st ill [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Uh , well , y you ’re say ing here .
m e013 [ s] : I c I should just let y ou go on .
m n007 [ s^ bk|s^ rt ] : Yeah , t here were sm all t ricks t o m ake t his
t andem net work work .
m n007 [ fh] : Uh , [ v ocalsound] m m m ,
m n007 [ s] : and one of t he t rick was t o , [ vocalsound] um , use
[ v ocalsound] som e kind of hierarchical st ruct ure
m n007 [ s] : where [ pause] t he silence probabilit y is not com put ed by
[ pause] t he final t andem net work but by t he VAD net work .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : so apparent ly it looks bet t er when , [ vocalsound] uh ,
we use t he silence probabilit y from t he VAD net work
m n007 [ s] : and we re − scale t he ot her probabilit ies by one m inus t he
silence probabilit y .
m e013 [ b] : Huh .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s] : So it ’s som e kind of hierarchical t hing , [ vocalsound] uh ,
t hat Sunil also t ried , um , [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] on SPINE
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : and apparent ly it helps a lit t le bit also .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ fh] : And .
m n007 [ fg|s.%−] : Yeah , t he reason w why [ disfm arker] why we did t hat
wit h t he silence probabilit y was t hat , [ vocalsound] um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy .%−−] : Could [ disfm arker] ? Uh , uh ,
m e013 [ s^ fa] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m really sorry .
m e013 [ qy ] : Can y ou repeat what you were saying about t he silence

m n007 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ %−] : I only [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df.%−] : My m ind was som e [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : So t here is t he t andem net work t hat e e e est im at es t he
phone probabilit ies
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : and t he silence probabilit ies also .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m n007 [ s] : And [ vocalsound] t hings get bet t er when , inst ead of using
t he silence probabilit y com put ed by t he t andem net work , we use t he
silence probabilit y , uh , given by t he VAD net work ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n007 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d.%−] : The VAD net work is [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ s] : Which is sm aller ,
m n007 [ %−−] : but m aybe ,
m n007 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : So we have a net work for t he VAD which has one
hundred hidden unit s ,
m n007 [ s] : and t he t andem net work has five hundred .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s] : So it ’s sm aller
m n007 [ s^ df] : but t h t he silence probabilit y [ pause] from t his net work
seem s , uh , bet t er .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ fh.%] : Mm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Uh .
m n007 [ s^ ba] : Well , it looks st range ,
m n007 [ %−] : but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa|%−−] : Yeah . But [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %−−] : but it
m e013 [ s^ ba.%] : OK .
m n007 [ s^ am ^ cs] : Maybe it ’s [ disfm arker] has som et hing t o do t o
[ v ocalsound] t he fact t hat [ vocalsound] we don’t have infinit e t raining
dat a
m n007 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qh^ d^ rt ] : We don’t ?
m n007 [ %−−] : Well !
m n007 [ fh] : And
m n007 [ s^ ba] : so [ disfm arker] Well , t hings are not opt im al
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s] : Are you [ disfm arker] you were going t o say why
[ disfm arker] what m ade you [ disfm arker] wh what led you t o do t hat .
m n007 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah . Uh , t here was a p [ com m ent ] problem t hat
we observed , um , [ v ocalsound] [ v ocalsound] t hat t here was
[ disfm arker] t here were , like , m any insert ions in t he [ disfm arker] in
t he sy st em .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m .

m e013 [ b.%] : Hm m .
m n007 [ s] : Act ually plugging in t he t andem net work was increasing , I
[ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I t hink , t he num ber of insert ions .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : And , [ v ocalsound] um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : So it looked st range
m n007 [ s] : and t hen just using t he [ disfm arker] t he ot her silence
probabilit y helps .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fg|s] : Yeah . The next t hing we will do is t rain t his t andem on
m ore dat a .
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So , y ou know , in a way what it m ight [ disfm arker] i it ’s
[ disfm arker] it ’s a lit t le bit like [ vocalsound] com bining knowledge
sources .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e013 [ s^ df] : Because [ vocalsound] t he fact t hat you have t hese t wo
net s t hat are different sizes [ pause] m eans t hey behave a lit t le
different ly ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ e] : t hey find different [ pause] t hings .
m e013 [ fh] : And , um ,
m e013 [ s] : if you hav e , um [ disfm arker] f t he dist ribut ion t hat you
have from , uh , f speech sounds is w [ com m ent ] sort of one source of
knowledge .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t his is [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and rat her t han just t aking one m inus t hat t o get t he
ot her ,
m e013 [ s] : which is essent ially what ’s happening ,
m e013 [ s] : y ou have t his ot her source of knowledge t hat you ’re
put t ing in t here .
m e013 [ s] : So you m ake use of bot h of t hem [ vocalsound] in
[ disfm arker] in [ pause] what you ’re ending up wit h .
m e013 [ s^ am ] : May be it ’s bet t er .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−] : Anyway , you can probably just ify anyt hing if what ’s
use
m n007 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and t he feat ures are different also .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : I m ean , t he VAD doesn’t use t he sam e feat ures t here are
.
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ b] : Hm m .

m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh !
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : That m ight be t he key , act ually .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ df] : Cuz you were really t hinking about speech versus
nonspeech for t hat .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : That ’s a good point .
m n007 [ b.%] : Mm m .
m n007 [ fh|s^ bd] : Uh . Well , t here are ot her t hings t hat [ vocalsound]
we should do
m n007 [ fh|s^ df] : but , [ vocalsound] um , [ vocalsound] it requires t im e
m n007 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] We have ideas ,
m n007 [ s] : like [ disfm arker] so , t hese t hings are like hav having a
bet t er VAD .
m n007 [ s] : Uh , we have som e ideas about t hat .
m n007 [ s] : It would [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] probably im plies working
a lit t le bit on feat ures t hat are m ore [ vocalsound] suit ed t o a voice
act ivit y det ect ion .
m e013 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : Working on t he second st ream .
m n007 [ s] : Of course we have ideas on t his also ,
m n007 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] w we need t o t ry different
t hings
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Uh , but t heir noise est im at ion ,
m n007 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , back on t he second st ream ,
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , t hat ’s som et hing we ’ve t alked about for a while .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , I t hink [ nonvocalsound] t hat ’s cert ainly a high
hope .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . [ vocalsound] Mm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : so we have t his [ disfm arker] t his default idea
about just using som e sort of purely spect ral t hing ?
m n007 [ h|s^ aa] : Uh , yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : for a second st ream ?
m n007 [ fh|s] : But , um , we [ disfm arker] we did a first t ry wit h t his ,
m n007 [ s] : and it [ disfm arker] it [ v ocalsound] clearly hurt s .
m e013 [ qw] : But , uh , how was t he st ream com bined ?
m n007 [ s] : Uh . [ v ocalsound] It was c it was just com bined , um , by
t he acoust ic m odel .
m n007 [ s^ e] : So t here was , no neural net work for t he m om ent .

m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ cs] : Right . So , I m ean , if you just had a second
st ream t hat was just spect ral and had anot her neural net and
com bined t here , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat , uh , [ vocalsound] m ight be
good .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah . Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fg|s] : Yeah , and t he ot her t hing , t hat noise est im at ion
m n007 [ s.%−−] : and t h um , m ay be t ry t o t rain [ disfm arker] uh , t he
t raining dat a for t he t
m n007 [ s] : t andem net work , right now , is like [ disfm arker] i is using
t he noises from t he Aurora t ask
m n007 [ s] : and [ v ocalsound] [ vocalsound] I t hink t hat people m ight ,
[ v ocalsound] um , t ry t o argue about t hat
m n007 [ s] : because [ vocalsound] t hen in som e cases we have t he
sam e noises in [ disfm arker] for t raining t he net work [ pause] t han t he
noises t hat are used for t est ing ,
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : So we have t n uh , t o t ry t o get rid of t hese [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] t his problem .
m e013 [ fg|s^ cs] : Yeah . Maybe you just put in som e ot her noise ,
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m . [ v ocalsound] Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : som et hing t hat ’s different .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , it [ disfm arker] it ’s probably helpful t o have
[ disfm arker] hav e a lit t le noise t here .
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : But it m ay be som et hing else
m e013 [ s.%−−] : t h at least you could say it was .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen [ disfm arker] if it doesn’t hurt t oo m uch , t hough .
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Yeah . That ’s a good idea .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ fg|s^ t ^ t c] : Yeah . The last t hing is t hat I t hink we are get t ing
close t o hum an perform ance .
m n007 [ s^ bd^ df] : Well , t hat ’s som et hing I would like t o invest igat e
furt her ,
m n007 [ %−−] : but ,
m n007 [ fh] : um ,
m n007 [ s] : I did , like , um [ disfm arker] I did , uh , list en t o t he m m ost

m n007 [ s] : and t ried t o t ranscribe t hem .

m n007 [ fh] : And , um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So t his is a part icular hum an .
m e013 [ s^ bu^ e] : This is [ disfm arker] t his i t his is St ephane .
m n007 [ s^ aa|s.%−] : Yeah . So t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s^ 2] : St − St ephane .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ bd] : t hat ’s t he [ disfm arker] t he flaw of t he experim ent .
m n007 [ s^ bd^ e] : This is just [ disfm arker] i j [ com m ent ] [ vocalsound]
[ v ocalsound] it ’s just one subject ,
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e006 [ s^ ba] : Get t ing close .
m n007 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ df] : but st ill , uh , [ vocalsound] what happens is
[ disfm arker] is t hat , [ vocalsound] uh , t he digit error rat e on t his is
around one percent ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ df^ e] : while our syst em is current ly at seven percent .
m n007 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um , but what happens also is t hat if I list en t o t he ,
um [ disfm arker] [ nonvocalsound] a re − synt hesized version of t he

m n007 [ s.%−−] : and [ pause] I re − synt hesized t his using a whit e noise
t hat ’s filt ered by a LPC , uh , filt er [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s] : well , you can argue , t hat , uh [ disfm arker] t hat t his is not
speech ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : so t he ear is not t rained t o recognize t his .
m n007 [ s] : But s act ually it sound like [ pause] whispering ,
m n007 [ s.%−−] : so we are [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Well , I m ean , it ’s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %−] : eh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : There ’s t wo problem s t here .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean [ disfm arker] I m ean , so [ disfm arker] so t he first is
[ v ocalsound] t hat by doing LPC − t welve wit h synt hesized speech w like
y ou ’re saying , uh , it ’s [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] i i you ’re
[ disfm arker] you ’re adding ot her degradat ion .
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e013 [ s^ e] : So it ’s not just t he noise
m e013 [ s^ e] : but y ou ’re adding in fact som e degradat ion
m e013 [ s^ df^ e] : because it ’s only an approxim at ion .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s] : and t he second t hing is [ disfm arker] which is m m aybe
m ore int erest ing [ disfm arker] is t hat , um , [ com m ent ] [ vocalsound] if
y ou do it wit h whispered speech , you get t his num ber .

m e013 [ qh^ cs] : What if you had [ pause] done analysis [ com m ent ] re −
sy nt hesis and t aken t he pit ch as well ?
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Alright ?
m e013 [ s] : So now you put t he pit ch in .
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ qh] : What would t he percent age be t hen ?
m n007 [ h] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : See , t hat ’s t he quest ion .
m e013 [ s] : So , y ou see , if it ’s [ disfm arker] if it ’s [ disfm arker] if it ’s ,
uh [ disfm arker] Let ’s say it ’s [ pause] back down t o one percent again
.
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : That would say at least for people , having t he pit ch is
really , really im port ant ,
m e013 [ s^ ba] : which would be int erest ing in it self .
m n007 [ s^ aap|%−] : Uh , yeah . But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s:s^ ba] : if i on t he ot her hand , if it st ayed up [ pause] near
five percent , [ v ocalsound] t hen I ’d say " boy , LPC n t welve is pret t y
crum m y " .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f] : You know ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s^ no] : So I I I ’m not sure [ disfm arker] I ’m not sure how we
can conclude from t his anyt hing about [ disfm arker] t hat our syst em is
close t o [ v ocalsound] t he hum an perform ance .
m n007 [ %−] : Ye
m n007 [ fg|s] : Yeah . Well , t he point is t hat eh l ey [ disfm arker] t he

when I re − synt hesized t he LP − t he LPC − t welve [ pause] spect rum
[ v ocalsound] is in a way what t he syst em , uh , is hearing ,
m n007 [ s^ df.%−−] : cuz @ @ [ disfm arker] all t he [ disfm arker] all t he ,
um , ex cit at ion [ disfm arker] all t he [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : well , t he excit at ion is [ disfm arker] is not t aken int o

m n007 [ s] : That ’s what we do wit h our syst em .
m n007 [ fh] : And
m e013 [ s^ nd.%−−] : Well , you ’re not doing t he LPC [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %−] : in t his case [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qh.%−] : I m ean , so [ disfm arker] so what if you did a
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk^ m |s^ aa] : Well , it ’s not LPC , sure ,
m n007 [ s^ df.%−] : but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qh^ cs] : What if you did LPC − t went y ?
m n007 [ qw^ br^ d^ m ] : LPC [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s] : Twent y .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?

m e013 [ s^ ba] : I m ean , t h t he t hing is LPC is not a [ disfm arker] a
really great represent at ion of speech .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So , all I ’m saying is t hat y ou have in addit ion t o t he w t he
, uh , rem ov al of pit ch , [ vocalsound] you also are doing , uh , a
part icular param et erizat ion ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ %−−] : which ,
m e013 [ fh] : um , uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b.%] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s^ t 1] : Uh , so , let ’s see ,
m e013 [ qw^ t 1.%−] : how would you do [ disfm arker] ? So , fo
m n007 [ s^ df] : But t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s what we do wit h our
sy st em s .
m n007 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : No . Act ually , we d we [ disfm arker] we don’t ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : because we do [ disfm arker] we do , uh , [ vocalsound]
uh , m el filt er bank , for inst ance .
m n007 [ s^ aap|qh^ df] : Yeah , but is it t hat [ disfm arker] is it t hat
different , I m ean ?
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e013 [ s^ bd^ no] : Um , [ vocalsound] I don’t know what m el , [ pause]
uh , based sy nt hesis would sound like ,
m n007 [ %−] : I
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ df^ ng] : but cert ainly t he spect ra are quit e different .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ qy^ cs^ rt ] : Couldn’t you t couldn’t you , um , t est t he hum an
perform ance on just t he original [ pause] audio ?
m n007 [ s] : This is t he one percent num ber .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , it ’s one percent .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : He ’s t ry ing t o rem ov e t he pit ch inform at ion
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , oh . OK ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ e] : and m ake it closer t o what [ disfm arker] t o what we ’re
seeing as t he feat ure vect ors .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : OK . So , y uh , your perform ance was one percent ,
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ s] : and t hen when you re − synt hesize wit h LPC − t welve it went
t o fiv e .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m e013 [ s] : I m ean [ disfm arker] We were [ disfm arker] we were j It
[ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it ’s a lit t le bit st ill apples and oranges
m e013 [ s] : because we are choosing t hese feat ures in order t o be
t he best for recognit ion .
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ fh] : And , um ,
m e013 [ s] : i if you list en t o t hem t hey st ill m ight not be very
[ disfm arker] Ev en if you m ade som et hing closer t o what we ’re gonna
[ disfm arker] i it m ight not sound very good .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , and i t he degradat ion from t hat m ight [ disfm arker]
m ight act ually m ake it even harder , [ vocalsound] uh , t o underst and
t han t he LPC − t welve .
m e013 [ s^ bs] : So all I ’m saying is t hat t he LPC − t welve [ vocalsound]
put s in [ disfm arker] synt hesis
m e013 [ s^ e] : put s in som e degradat ion
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : t hat ’s not what we ’re used t o hearing ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and is , um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : It ’s not [ disfm arker] it ’s not just a quest ion of how m uch
inform at ion is t here , as if you will always t ake m axim um [ vocalsound]
advant age of any inform at ion t hat ’s present ed t o you .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : In fact , you [ vocalsound] hear som e t hings bet t er t han
ot hers .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And so it [ disfm arker] it isn’t [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s] : But , [ v ocalsound] I agree t hat it says t hat , uh , t he
kind of inform at ion t hat we ’re feeding it is probably , [ vocalsound] um ,
um , a lit t le bit , um , m inim al .
m e013 [ s] : There ’s definit ely som e t hings t hat we ’ve t hrown away .
m e013 [ s] : And t hat ’s why I was say ing it m ight be int erest ing if you
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] an int erest ing t est of t his would be if you
[ disfm arker] if y ou act ually put t he pit ch back in .
m e013 [ s] : So , y ou just ext ract it from t he act ual speech and put it
back in ,
m e013 [ qh] : and see does t hat [ disfm arker] is t hat [ disfm arker] does
t hat m ake t he difference ?
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s:s] : If t hat [ disfm arker] if t hat t akes it down t o one percent
again , [ v ocalsound] t hen you ’d say " OK , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s in fact
having , um , [ v ocalsound] not just t he spect ral envelope but also t he
[ disfm arker] also t he [ disfm arker] t he pit ch [ vocalsound] t hat , uh ,
[ com m ent ] @ @ [ com m ent ] has t he inform at ion t hat people can use ,
anyway . "
m n007 [ b.%] : Mm m .

m e018 [ s^ bu] : But from t his it ’s pret t y safe t o say t hat t he syst em is
wit h eit her [ v ocalsound] t wo t o seven percent away from [ pause] t he
perform ance of a hum an .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e018 [ s^ bu^ e] : So it ’s som ewhere in t hat range .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Well , or it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa|%−] : Yeah , so [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu^ e] : Two [ disfm arker] t wo t o six percent .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s one point four t im es , uh , t o , uh ,
sev en t im es t he error ,
m n007 [ s^ 2|s^ aa] : To f seven t im es , yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : for St ephane .
m n007 [ fg] : Um .
m e013 [ fh] : So , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bd^ no] : uh , but i I don’t know .
m n007 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I do don’t wanna t ake you away from ot her t hings .
m e013 [ s.%−] : But t hat ’s [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t hat ’s what
[ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he first t hing t hat I would be curious about , is ,
y ou know , i i [ v ocalsound] when y ou we
m n007 [ s] : But t he signal it self is like a m ix of [ disfm arker] um , of a
[ disfm arker] a periodic sound and , [ pause] @ @ [ com m ent ] uh ,
unv oiced sound , and t he noise
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : which is m ost ly , [ vocalsound] uh , noise .
m n007 [ s^ e] : I m ean not [ pause] periodic .
m n007 [ qw.%−−] : So , [ pause] what [ disfm arker] what do you m ean
ex act ly by put t ing back t he pit ch in ?
m n007 [ s^ df.%−] : Because [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : In t he LPC synt hesis ?
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah . You did LPC re − synt hesis [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ %−] : I t hink [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %−] : I
m n007 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s^ r] : L PC re − synt hesis .
m e013 [ fh|s^ bu] : So , [ vocalsound] uh [ disfm arker] and you did it wit h
a noise source ,
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bu^ e] : rat her t han wit h [ disfm arker] wit h a s periodic
source .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e013 [ s] : So if you act ually did real re − synt hesis like you do in an
LPC sy nt hesizer , where it ’s unv oiced you use noise ,
m e013 [ s] : where it ’s voiced you use , [ vocalsound] uh , periodic

m n007 [ h] : Um .

m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m n007 [ s^ bk|s^ df^ nd] : Yeah , but it ’s neit her [ pause] purely voiced
or purely unv oiced .
m n007 [ s^ df] : Esp − especially because t here is noise .
m e013 [ s^ bd^ na] : Well , it m ight be hard t o do it
m n007 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ df^ nd] : but it but [ disfm arker] but t he t hing is t hat if you
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] um , if you det ect t hat t here ’s periodic
[ disfm arker] s st rong periodic com ponent s , t hen you can use a voiced

m n007 [ b.%] : Oh .
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s^ bd] : Yeah . I m ean , it ’s probably not wort h your t im e .
m e013 [ s^ df^ e] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s a side t hing

m n007 [ s^ aa] : Uh − huh , yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df] : But I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m just saying , at least as a

m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t hen t hat would t ell you whet her in fact it ’s
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ df] : Cuz we ’ve t alked about , like , t his harm onic t unneling

m e013 [ s^ am ^ cs] : m aybe t hat ’s really a key elem ent .
m e013 [ s^ am ] : May be [ disfm arker] m aybe , uh , [ vocalsound] uh ,
wit hout t hat , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not possible t o do a whole lot

m e013 [ s^ am ] : That [ disfm arker] t hat could be .

it ’s hard t o im agine t hat t here ’s a whole lot m ore [ vocalsound] in t he

m e013 [ s.%−−] : If som ebody was paying really close at t ent ion , you

m e018 [ s] : Ot her com parable syst em s from , uh [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] were get t ing from , uh , like six point nine , six point eight

m e018 [ s] : but t hey [ disfm arker] t hey don’t have a whole lot of it filled

m e013 [ x] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e018 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] and I didn’t not ice unt il aft er

what t hese different t est ing condit ions are .
m e018 [ s^ e] : You act ually have t o click on it on t he web sit e t o see

m e013 [ qw] : What kind of num bers are t hey get t ing on t hese
[ disfm arker] on t he t est condit ions ?
m e018 [ s] : Well , see , I was a lit t le confused
m e018 [ s^ df] : because on t his t able , I ’m [ disfm arker] t he t hey ’re

m e013 [ %−−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , we [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw] : W what ’s [ disfm arker] what ’s som e of t he lower error

m n007 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : and if you ’re saying sixt y − t housand word recognit ion ,
get t ing sixt y percent error on som e of t hese noise condit ion not at all

m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : The baseline is sixt y percent also on digit s ,
m e018 [ s^ bk|qy ^ bh^ rt ] : Oh , is it ?
m n007 [ s^ e] : on t he m m ore [ pause] m ism at ched condit ions .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ fh] : So .

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : So , y eah , t hat ’s probably what it is t hen .
m e018 [ fh|s] : Yeah . So t hey have a lot of different condit ions t hat
t hey ’re gonna be filling out .
m e013 [ s^ ba^ fe] : It ’s a bad sign when y ou [ disfm arker] looking at
t he num bers , you can’t t ell whet her it ’s accuracy or error rat e .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fg|s^ ba] : Yeah . It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s gonna be hard .
m e018 [ fh] : Um ,
m e018 [ s] : t hey ’re [ disfm arker] I I ’m st ill wait ing for t hem t o [ pause]
release t he , um , [ v ocalsound] m ult i − CPU version of t heir script s ,
m e018 [ s^ df] : cuz right now t heir script only handles processing on a

m e018 [ s] : which will t ake a really long t im e t o run .
m e018 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : This is for t he t raining ?
m e018 [ %−] : But t heir s
m e018 [ h|s.%−−] : Uh [ disfm arker] I beli
m e018 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yes , for t he t raining [ pause] also .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s] : And , um , t hey ’re supposed t o be com ing out wit h it any
t im e ,
m e018 [ s] : t he m ult i − CPU one .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s] : So , as soon as t hey get t hat , t hen I ’ll [ disfm arker] I ’ll

m e018 [ %−] : and so w
m e013 [ fg|s^ df] : Yeah . Cuz we have t o get st art ed ,
m e013 [ s^ df.%−] : cuz it ’s [ disfm arker] cuz , uh ,
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fg|s] : Yeah . I ’ll go ahead and t ry t o run it t hough wit h just t he

m e013 [ %−] : if t he [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] t hey [ disfm arker] t hey ,
[ v ocalsound] um , released like a sm aller dat a set t hat you can use
t hat only t akes like sixt een hours t o t rain and st uff .
m e018 [ s] : So I can [ disfm arker] I can run it on t hat just t o m ake sure
t hat t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t he t hing works and everyt hing .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : Oh ! Good .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e006 [ b.%] : Hm m .
m e013 [ %−−] : Cuz we ’ll [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I guess t he act ual evaluat ion will be in six weeks or

m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t hat about right [ pause] you t hink ?

m n007 [ s^ no] : Uh , we don’t know yet , I [ disfm arker] I t hink .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ m ^ rt ] : Really , we don’t know ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ b.%] : Hm m .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : It wasn’t on t he conference call t his m orning ?
m n007 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e018 [ s^ bk.%] : Hm m .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Did t hey say any t hing on t he conference call [ pause]
about , um , how t he [ pause] Wall St reet Journal part of t he t est was
going t o be [ pause] run ?
m e018 [ s^ df] : Because I [ disfm arker] I t hought I rem em bered hearing
t hat som e sit es [ v ocalsound] were saying t hat t hey didn’t have t he

m n007 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e018 [ s] : so t here was som e t alk about having Mississippi St at e run
[ pause] t he syst em s for t hem .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : And I [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Did [ disfm arker] did t hat com e up at all ?
m n007 [ s^ ar] : Uh , no .
m n007 [ s^ df^ rt ] : Well , t his [ disfm arker] first , t his was not t he point
at all of t his [ disfm arker] t he m eet ing t oday
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n007 [ fh] : and ,
m n007 [ s^ no] : uh , frankly , I don’t know
m e013 [ %−] : Som e
m n007 [ s^ df] : because I d [ com m ent ] didn’t read also t he [ pause]
m ost recent m ails about [ vocalsound] t he large − vocabulary t ask .
m n007 [ qy ] : But , [ v ocalsound] uh , did you [ disfm arker] do you st ill ,
uh , get t he m ails ?
m n007 [ qrr^ d] : You ’re not on t he m ailing list or what ?
m e018 [ s^ ar] : Hm m − m m .
m e018 [ s] : The only , um , m ail I get is from Mississippi St at e
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk|s] : Oh , yeah . So we should have a look at t his .
m e018 [ s^ e] : about t heir syst em .
m e018 [ s.%−] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t get any [ pause] m ail about
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I hav e t o say , t here ’s uh som et hing funny − sounding
about saying t hat one of t hese big com panies doesn’t have enough
cup com put e power do t hat ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : so t hey ’re having t o have it done by Mississippi St at e .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s^ ba] : It just [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] just sounds funny .
m e018 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . It does .
m e013 [ fh] : But ,
m e013 [ s^ t c] : anyway .
m e018 [ fg|s] : Yeah . I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m wondering about t hat
m e018 [ s^ df] : because t here ’s t his whole issue about , you know ,
sim ple t uning param et ers , like word insert ion penalt ies .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : And [ pause] whet her or not t hose are going t o be t uned
or not ,
m e018 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] So .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : I m ean , it m akes a big difference .
m e018 [ s] : If you change your front − end , you know , t he scale is
com plet ely [ disfm arker] can be com plet ely different ,
m e018 [ fh] : so .
m e018 [ s] : It seem s reasonable t hat t hat at least should be t weaked
t o m at ch t he front − end .
m e018 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : You didn’t get any answer from [ pause] Joe ?
m e018 [ s^ na] : I did ,
m e018 [ s:s] : but Joe [ pause] said , y ou know , " what you ’re saying
m akes sense
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ s:s^ no] : and [ pause] I don’t know " .
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ s^ e] : So he doesn’t know what t he answer is .
m e018 [ qh] : I m ean , t hat ’s t h We had t his back and fort h a lit t le bit
about , [ v ocalsound] you know , are sit es gonna [ disfm arker] are you
gonna run t his dat a for different sit es ?
m e018 [ s] : And , well , if [ disfm arker] if Mississippi St at e runs it , t hen
m ay be t hey ’ll do a lit t le opt im izat ion on t hat [ pause] param et er ,
m e018 [ fh] : and , uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : But t hen he wasn’t asked t o run it for anybody .
m e018 [ s] : So i it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s just not clear yet what ’s gonna
happen .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : Uh , he ’s been put t ing t his st uff out on t heir web sit e and
[ disfm arker] for people t o grab
m e018 [ s] : but I haven’t heard t oo m uch about what ’s happening .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So it could be [ disfm arker] I m ean , Chuck and I had
act ually t alked about t his a couple t im es , and [ disfm arker] and
[ disfm arker] over som e lunches , I t hink , [ vocalsound] t hat , um ,
[ v ocalsound] one t hing t hat we m ight wanna do [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qh] : The − t here ’s t his quest ion about , you know , what do
y ou wanna scale ?

m e013 [ s] : Suppose y you can’t adjust [ vocalsound] t hese word
insert ion penalt ies and so fort h ,
m e013 [ s] : so y ou have t o do everyt hing at t he level of t he feat ures .
m e013 [ qh] : What could you do ?
m e013 [ s] : And , uh , one t hing I had suggest ed at an earlier t im e was
m ay be som e sort of scaling ,
m e013 [ s] : som e sort of root or [ disfm arker] or som et hing of t he , um
, [ v ocalsound] uh , feat ures .
m e013 [ s] : But t he problem wit h t hat is t hat isn’t quit e t he sam e ,
m e013 [ s] : it occurred t o m e lat er ,
m e013 [ s^ df.%−] : because what you really want t o do is scale t he , uh
, @ @ [ com m ent ] t he range of t he likelihoods rat her t han [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ 2.%−] : Nnn , t he dist
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df] : But , [ vocalsound] what m ight get at som et hing sim ilar
, it just occurred t o m e , is kind of an int erm ediat e t hing [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ cs] : is because we do t his st range t hing t hat we do wit h
t he t andem sy st em , at least in t hat syst em what you could do
[ v ocalsound] is t ake t he , um , [ vocalsound] uh , values t hat com e out
of t he net ,
m e013 [ s] : which are som et hing like log probabilit ies ,
m e013 [ s] : and scale t hose .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen , uh , um [ disfm arker] [ pause] t hen at least
t hose t hings would have t he right values
m e013 [ s^ bsc] : or t he right [ disfm arker] t he right range .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen t hat goes int o t he rest of it and t hen t hat ’s
used as observ at ions .
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s , [ vocalsound] um , anot her way t o
do it .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ df^ nd] : But , t hese values are not direct ly used as
probabilit ies anyway .
m e013 [ s^ na] : I know t hey ’re not .
m n007 [ s.%−] : So t here are [ disfm arker] t here is [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ m ^ na] : I know t hey ’re not .
m e013 [ %−−] : But [ disfm arker] but ,
m e013 [ fh] : y ou know [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s^ df] : So because what we ’re doing is pret t y st range and
com plicat ed , we don’t really know what t he effect is [ pause] at t he
ot her end .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So , [ vocalsound] um , [ pause] m y t hought was m aybe
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : I m ean , t hey ’re not used as probabilit ies ,

m e013 [ s.%−−] : but t he log probabilit ies [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : we ’re t aking advant age of t he fact t hat som et hing like log
probabilit ies has m ore of a Gaussian shape t han Gaus − t han
[ v ocalsound] probabilit ies ,
m e013 [ s] : and so we can m odel t hem bet t er .
m e013 [ s] : So , [ pause] in a way we ’re t aking advant age of t he fact
t hat t hey ’re probabilit ies ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : because t hey ’re t his quant it y t hat looks kind of
Gaussian when you t ake it ’s log .
m e013 [ s] : So , [ com m ent ] [ vocalsound] uh , m aybe [ disfm arker]
m ay be it would hav e a [ disfm arker] a reasonable effect t o do t hat .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ no] : I d I don’t know .
m e013 [ s] : But , [ pause] I m ean , I guess we st ill haven’t had a
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] a ruling back on t his .
m e013 [ s] : And we m ay end up being in a sit uat ion where we just you
know really can’t change t he [ v ocalsound] word insert ion penalt y .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : But t he ot her t hing we could do [ vocalsound] is
[ disfm arker] also we could [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bd^ df] : I m ean , t his [ disfm arker] t his m ay not help us ,
[ v ocalsound] uh , in t he evaluat ion
m e013 [ s] : but it m ight help us in our underst anding at least .
m e013 [ s] : We m ight , [ vocalsound] just run it wit h different insper
insert ion penalt ies ,
m e013 [ s:s] : and show t hat , uh , " well , OK , not changing it ,
[ v ocalsound] playing t he rules t he way you want ed , we did t his . But in
fact if we did t hat , it m ade a [ disfm arker] [ pause] a big difference . "
m e018 [ s^ cs] : I wonder if it [ disfm arker] it m ight be possible t o , uh ,
sim ulat e t he back − end wit h som e ot her syst em .
m e018 [ s] : So we [ disfm arker] we get our f front − end feat ures ,
m e018 [ s.%−−] : and t hen ,
m e018 [ fh] : uh ,
m e018 [ s] : as part of t he process of figuring out t he scaling of t hese
feat ures , [ com m ent ] you know , if we ’re gonna t ake it t o a root or t o
a power or som et hing , [ com m ent ] [ vocalsound] we have som e back −
end t hat we at t ach ont o our feat ures t hat sort of sim ulat es what
would be happening .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d] : And just adjust it unt il it ’s t he best num ber ?
m e018 [ s^ m ^ na.%−] : and just adjust it unt il t hat [ disfm arker] our l
v ersion of t he back − end , uh , decides t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s^ cs] : Well , we can probably use t he real t hing ,
m e013 [ qy ^ g] : can’t we ?

m e013 [ s^ cs^ e] : And t hen jus just , uh , [ vocalsound] use it on a
reduced t est set or som et hing .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Oh , yeah .
m e018 [ s^ na] : That ’s t rue .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : And t hen we just use t hat t o det erm ine som e scaling
fact or t hat we use .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah . So I m ean , I I t hink t hat t hat ’s a reasonable
t hing t o do
m e013 [ qh] : and t he only quest ion is what ’s t he act ual knob t hat we
use ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t he knob t hat we use should [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : uh , uh , unfort unat ely , like I say , I don’t know t he analyt ic
solut ion t o t his
m e013 [ s^ df] : cuz what we really want t o do is change t he scale of
t he likelihoods ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : not t he cha not t he scale of t he [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] t he [ pause] observat ions .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker] but , uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e006 [ qw^ t ^ t c] : Out of curiosit y , what [ disfm arker] what kind of
recognizer [ pause] is t he one from Mississippi St at e ?
m e018 [ qw] : Uh , w what do you m ean when you say " what kind " ?
m e006 [ qy .%−] : Is it [ disfm arker] ?
m e006 [ qy] : Um , is it like a [ pause] Gaussian m ixt ure m odel ?
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ m ^ na] : Gaussian m ix t ure m odel .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s] : It ’s t he sam e syst em t hat t hey use [ pause] when t hey
part icipat e in t he Hub − five evals .
m e018 [ s] : It ’s a , [ v ocalsound] um [ disfm arker] sort of [ pause] cam e

m e018 [ s] : And so , [ vocalsound] it ’s a Gaussian m ixt ure syst em ,
m e018 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ] : Do t hey have t he sam e sort of m ix − down sort of

m e018 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m e018 [ fg|s^ 2] : Yeah . And t hen [ pause] divide t he m ixt ures in half .
m e013 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker] ?

m e006 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ qy ] : D Do y ou know what kind of t ying t hey use ?
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Are t hey [ disfm arker] t hey sort of [ disfm arker] som e

m e018 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , t h I have [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I
[ disfm arker] I don’t have it up here

m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and t hen , [ vocalsound]
when y ou get a new [ disfm arker] new t hing t hat you [ disfm arker] you

m e018 [ b] : Hm m .

m e013 [ s] : You do t his kind of [ vocalsound] piece − wise linear or ,
[ v ocalsound] uh , som e kind of piece − wise approxim at ion .
m e013 [ s] : They did a [ disfm arker] uh one version t hat was piece −

[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] bet ween t he [ pause] point s .
m e013 [ fh] : And , uh ,
m e013 [ s] : t hey said t hey s t hey sort of see it in a way as s for t he
speech case [ com m ent ] [ disfm arker] as being kind of a generalizat ion
of spect ral subt ract ion in a way ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : because , you know , in spect ral subt ract ion you ’re
t ry ing t o [ vocalsound] get rid of t his excess energy .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , you know , it ’s not supposed t o be t here .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] and , uh ,
m e013 [ s] : t his is sort of [ pause] [ v ocalsound] adjust ing it for

m e013 [ s] : And t hen t hey have s t hey have som e kind of ,
[ v ocalsound] uh , [ pause] a floor or som et hing ,

m e013 [ s.%−] : I guess in pri
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ na] : In principle .
m e013 [ s^ bd^ df] : I didn’t read carefully how t hey act ually

m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : whet her it was som e , [ vocalsound] uh , on − line t hing ,
or whet her it was a second pass , or what .
m e013 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but t hey [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] That
[ disfm arker] t hat was sort of t he idea .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat seem ed , you know , different .
m e013 [ qh] : We ’re sort of curious about , uh , what are som e t hings
t hat are , u u um , [ vocalsound] @ @ [ com m ent ] [ pause] concept ually
quit e different from what we ’ve done .
m e013 [ s^ df] : Cuz we [ disfm arker] you know , one t hing t hat w t hat ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ s] : uh , St ephane and Sunil seem ed t o find , [ vocalsound] uh ,
was , y ou know , t hey could act ually m ake a unified piece of soft ware
t hat handled a range of different t hings t hat people were t alking
about ,
m e013 [ s] : and it was really just sort of set t ing of different [ pause]
const ant s .
m e013 [ s] : And it would t urn , you know , one t hing int o anot her .
m e013 [ s] : It ’d t urn Wiener filt ering int o spect ral subt ract ion , or
what ev er .
m e013 [ s] : But t here ’s ot her t hings t hat we ’re not doing .
m e013 [ s] : So , we ’re not m aking any use of pit ch ,
m e013 [ s] : uh , uh , which again , m ight [ disfm arker] m ight be
im port ant ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : uh , because t he st uff bet ween t he harm onics is
probably a schm ut z .
m e013 [ s^ j] : And [ disfm arker] and t he , [ vocalsound] uh , t ranscribers
will hav e fun wit h t hat .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] And , um ,
m e013 [ s] : t he , uh , st uff at t he harm onics isn’t so m uch .
m e013 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker] and , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : And we t here ’s t his ov erall idea of really sort of m at ching
t he [ disfm arker] t he hi dist ribut ions som ehow .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Uh , not just ,
m e013 [ fh] : um , [ vocalsound] um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : not just subt ract ing off your est im at e of t he noise .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s^ bu^ t ^ t c] : So I guess , uh , [ vocalsound] Guent er ’s gonna
play around wit h som e of t hese t hings now over t his next [ pause]
period ,
m n007 [ h|s^ no] : Uh , I dunno .
m e013 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ s^ e^ no] : I don’t have feedback from him ,
m n007 [ fh] : but
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−] : I guess he ’s gonna , m aybe [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Well , he ’s got it any way ,
m e013 [ s] : so he can .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : So pot ent ially if he cam e up wit h som et hing t hat was
useful , like a diff a bet t er noise est im at ion m odule or som et hing , he
could ship it t o you guys u up t here
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : and
m e013 [ s] : we could put it in .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m . [ vocalsound] Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So ,
m e013 [ s^ ba^ t c] : t hat ’s good .
m e013 [ fg|qh.%−−] : So , why don’t we just , uh , um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I t hink st art ing [ disfm arker] [ pause] st art ing a w couple
weeks from now , especially if you ’re not gonna be around for a while ,
we ’ll [ disfm arker] we ’ll be shift ing m ore over t o som e ot her
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] ot her t errit ory .
m e013 [ fh] : But , uh , uh , [ com m ent ] uh ,
m e013 [ s] : n not [ disfm arker] not so m uch in t his m eet ing about
Aurora ,
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker] but , uh ,
m e013 [ s^ cs^ t ^ t c] : uh , m ay be just , uh , quickly t oday about
[ disfm arker] m ay be y ou could just say a lit t le bit about what you ’ve
been t alking about wit h Michael .
m e013 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ cs^ t ] : and t hen Barry can say som et hing about [ pause]
what [ com m ent ] [ disfm arker] what we ’re t alking about .
m e026 [ s^ aa] : OK .
m e026 [ s] : So Michael Kleinschm idt , who ’s a PHD st udent from
Germ any , [ vocalsound] showed up t his week .
m e026 [ s] : He ’ll be here for about six m ont hs .
m e026 [ s] : And he ’s done som e work using [ vocalsound] an audit ory
m odel [ pause] of , um , [ vocalsound] hum an hearing ,
m e026 [ s] : and [ pause] using t hat f uh , t o generat e speech
recognit ion feat ures .
m e026 [ s] : And [ pause] he did [ vocalsound] work back in Germ any
[ v ocalsound] wit h , um , a t oy recognit ion syst em [ vocalsound] using ,
um , isolat ed [ vocalsound] digit recognit ion [ vocalsound] as t he t ask .
m e026 [ s] : It was act ually just a single − layer neural net work
[ v ocalsound] t hat classified words [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s^ e] : classified digit s , [ vocalsound] in fact .
m e026 [ s] : Um , and [ pause] he t ried t hat on [ disfm arker] I t hink on
som e Aurora dat a and got result s t hat he t hought [ pause] seem ed
respect able .
m e026 [ fh] : And
m e026 [ s] : he w he ’s com ing here t o u u use it on a [ vocalsound] uh ,
a real speech recognit ion syst em .
m e026 [ s] : So I ’ll be working wit h him on t hat .
m e026 [ fh] : And , um ,
m e026 [ s] : m ay be I should say a lit t le m ore about t hese feat ures ,
m e026 [ s^ bd^ df] : alt hough I don’t underst and t hem t hat well .
m e026 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s a t wo − st age idea .

m e026 [ s] : And , um , [ vocalsound] t he first st age of t hese feat ures
correspond t o what ’s called t he peripheral [ vocalsound] audit ory
sy st em .
m e026 [ s] : And [ vocalsound] I guess t hat is like [ vocalsound] a filt er
bank wit h a com pressive nonlinearit y .
m e026 [ s^ no] : And [ vocalsound] I ’m − I ’m not sure what we have @
@ in t here t hat isn’t already m odeled in som et hing like , [ vocalsound]
um , [ pause] PLP .
m e026 [ s] : I should learn m ore about t hat .
m e026 [ s] : And t hen [ vocalsound] t he second st age [ pause] is , um ,
[ v ocalsound] t he m ost different t hing , I t hink , from what we usually do
.
m e026 [ s] : It ’s , um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] it
com put es feat ures which are , [ vocalsound] um , [ vocalsound] based
on [ disfm arker] sort of like based on diffe different w um , wav elet
basis funct ions [ vocalsound] used t o analy ze [ vocalsound] t he input .
m e026 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e026 [ s] : So t h he uses analysis funct ions called [ vocalsound] Gabor
funct ions ,
m e026 [ s] : um , [ v ocalsound] which have a cert ain [ vocalsound]
ex t ent , um , [ v ocalsound] in t im e and in frequency .
m e026 [ s^ rt ] : And [ v ocalsound] t he idea is t hese are used t o sam ple
, [ v ocalsound] um , t he signal in a represent ed as a t im e − frequency
represent at ion .
m e026 [ s] : So you ’re [ pause] sam pling som e piece of t his t im e −
frequency plane .
m e026 [ s] : And , um , [ vocalsound] t hat , [ vocalsound] um , is
[ disfm arker] is int erest ing ,
m e026 [ s] : cuz , [ v ocalsound] @ @ for [ disfm arker] for one t hing , you
could use it , [ v ocalsound] um , in a [ disfm arker] a m ult i − scale way .
m e026 [ s.%−−] : You could have t hese [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s.%−−] : inst ead of hav ing everyt hing [ disfm arker] like we use a
t went y − fiv e m illisecond or so analysis window , [ vocalsound] t ypically ,
m e026 [ s] : um , and t hat ’s our t im e scale for feat ures ,
m e026 [ s] : but y ou could [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] using t his , um ,
basis funct ion idea , you could have som e basis funct ions
m e026 [ s] : which hav e a lot longer t im e scale
m e026 [ s] : and , um , som e which hav e a lot short er ,
m e026 [ s] : and [ vocalsound] so it would be like [ pause] a set of m ult i
− scale feat ures .
m e026 [ s.%−−] : So he ’s int erest ed in , um [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s] : Th − t his is [ disfm arker] because it ’s , um [ disfm arker]
t here are t hese different param et ers for t he shape of t hese
[ v ocalsound] basis funct ions , [ vocalsound] um [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] t here are a lot of different possible basis funct ions .

m e026 [ s] : And so he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] he act ually does
[ v ocalsound] an opt im izat ion procedure t o choose an [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] an opt im al set of basis funct ions out of all t he possible
ones .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ %−] : H
m e018 [ qw] : What does he do t o choose t hose ?
m e026 [ s^ ba] : The m et hod he uses is kind of funny [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s] : is , [ com m ent ] [ vocalsound] um , [ vocalsound] he st art s
wit h [ disfm arker] he has a set of M of t hem .
m e026 [ fh] : Um ,
m e026 [ s] : he [ disfm arker] and t hen [ pause] he uses t hat t o classify
[ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s^ rt ] : I m ean , he t he t ries , um , [ vocalsound] using [ pause]
just M m inus one of t hem .
m e026 [ s] : So t here are M possible subset s of t his [ vocalsound]
lengt h − M vect or .
m e026 [ s] : He t ries classifying , using each of t he M [ vocalsound]
possible sub − v ect ors .
m n007 [ b] : Hm m .
m e026 [ s] : Whichever sub − vect or , [ v ocalsound] um , works t he
[ disfm arker] t he best , I guess , he says [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t he
[ disfm arker] t he fe feat ure t hat didn’t use was t he m ost useless
feat ure ,
m e013 [ b] : Y yeah .
m e013 [ s^ 2] : Get s t hrown out .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e026 [ s] : so we ’ll t hrow it out
m e026 [ s] : and we ’re gonna random ly select anot her feat ure [ pause]
from t he set of possible basis funct ions .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Hm m !
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s.%−] : So it ’s a [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : So i so it ’s act uall
m e018 [ s] : it ’s a lit t le bit like a genet ic algorit hm or som et hing in a
way .
m e006 [ s.%−] : It ’s like a greedy [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ng] : Well , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s m uch sim pler .
m e013 [ s] : But it ’s [ disfm arker] but it ’s [ disfm arker] uh , it ’s
[ disfm arker] t here ’s a lot [ disfm arker] num ber of t hings I like about it ,
let m e just say .
m e018 [ s^ e] : Greedy .
m e013 [ s] : So , first t hing , well , y ou ’re absolut ely right .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , [ vocalsound] i i [ nonvocalsound] in t rut h , [ pause]
bot h pieces of t his are [ disfm arker] hav e t heir analogies in st uff we
already do .

m e013 [ s] : But it ’s a different t ake [ vocalsound] at how t o approach
it
m e013 [ s] : and pot ent ially one t hat ’s m m aybe a bit m ore syst em at ic
t han what we ’ve done ,
m e013 [ s] : uh , and a b a bit m ore inspirat ion from [ disfm arker] from
audit ory t hings .
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] so I t hink it ’s a neat t hing t o t ry .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : The prim ary feat ures , [ vocalsound] um , are in fact
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Yeah , essent ially , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s , uh , you know ,
PLP or [ disfm arker] or m el cepst rum , or som et hing like t hat .
m e013 [ s] : You ’ve [ disfm arker] you ’ve got som e , [ vocalsound] uh ,
com pression .
m e013 [ s] : We always have som e com pression .
m e013 [ s] : We always have som e [ disfm arker] you know , t he
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he kind of filt er bank wit h a kind of
[ v ocalsound] [ v ocalsound] quasi − log scaling .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Um , [ vocalsound] if you put in [ disfm arker] if you also
include t he RASTA in it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : i RASTA [ disfm arker] t he filt ering being done in t he log
dom ain [ vocalsound] has an AGC − like , uh , charact erist ic , which , you
know , people t y pi t ypically put in t hese kind of , [ vocalsound] uh ,
[ pause] um , [ v ocalsound] uh , audit ory front − ends .
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s v ery , very sim ilar ,
m e013 [ s] : uh , but it ’s not exact ly t he sam e .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s] : I would agree t hat t he second one is [ disfm arker] is
som ewhat m ore different
m e013 [ s] : but , [ v ocalsound] um , it ’s m ainly different in t hat t he
t hings t hat we hav e been doing like t hat have been [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] um , had a different kind of m ot ivat ion and have ended
up wit h different kinds of const raint s .
m e013 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : So , for inst ance , if you look at t he LDA RASTA
st uff , [ v ocalsound] you know , basically what t hey do is t hey
[ disfm arker] t hey look at t he different eigenvect ors out of t he LDA and
t hey form filt ers out of it . Right ?
m e013 [ s] : And t hose [ pause] filt ers have different , uh , kinds of
t em poral ext ent s and t em poral charact erist ics .
m e013 [ s] : And so in fact t hey ’re m ult i − scale .
m e013 [ s] : But , t hey ’re not sort of syst em at ically m ult i − scale , like "
let ’s st art here and go t o t here , and go t o t here , and go t o t here " ,
and so fort h .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s m ore like , [ vocalsound] you run it on t his , you do
discrim inant analy sis , and you find out what ’s helpful .
m e026 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : I it ’s m ult i − scale because you use several of
t hese in parallel ,

m e013 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e026 [ qy^ rt ] : is t hat right ?
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . They use sev eral of t hem .
m e026 [ %−] : Of [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Uh , I m ean , you don’t hav e t o
m e013 [ s^ df] : but [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] but , uh , Hynek has .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but it ’s also , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ s] : Hy n − when Hynek ’s had people do t his kind of LDA
analy sis , t hey ’ve done it on frequency direct ion
m e013 [ s] : and t hey ’ve done it on t he t im e direct ion .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink he m ay have had people som et im es doing it on
bot h sim ult aneously [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ e] : som e t wo − D [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : and t hat would be t he closest t o t hese Gabor funct ion
kind of t hings .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , but I don’t t hink t hey ’v e done t hat m uch of t hat .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And , uh , t he ot her t hing t hat ’s int erest ing
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he , uh [ disfm arker] t he feat ure
select ion t hing ,
m e013 [ s] : it ’s a sim ple m et hod ,
m e013 [ s] : but I kinda like it .
m e013 [ s] : Um , [ vocalsound] t here ’s a [ disfm arker] [ pause] a old ,
old m et hod for feat ure select ion .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , [ pause] eh , uh , I rem em ber people referring t o it
as old when I was playing wit h it t went y y ears ago ,
m e013 [ s] : so I know it ’s pret t y old ,
m e013 [ s] : uh , called St epwise Linear Discrim inant Analysis
m e013 [ s.%−−] : in which you [ disfm arker] which [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I t hink it ’s used in social sciences a lot .
m e013 [ s] : So , y ou [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker] you
pick t he best feat ure .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen [ vocalsound] you t ake [ disfm arker] y you find t he
next feat ure t hat ’s t he best in com binat ion wit h it .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen so on and so on .
m e013 [ s] : And what [ disfm arker] what Michael ’s describing seem s t o
m e m uch , m uch bet t er ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : because t he problem wit h t he st epwise discrim inant
analy sis is t hat you don’t know t hat [ disfm arker] you know , if you ’ve
[ v ocalsound] picked t he right set of feat ures .
m e013 [ s^ df] : Just because som et hing ’s a good feat ure doesn’t
m ean t hat you should be adding it .
m e013 [ fh] : So , [ v ocalsound] um , [ pause] uh ,

m e013 [ s] : here at least you ’re st art ing off wit h all of t hem ,
m e013 [ s] : and y ou ’re [ vocalsound] t hrowing out useless feat ures .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : I t hink t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat seem s , uh [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] t hat seem s like a lot bet t er idea .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , you ’re always looking at t hings in com binat ion wit h
ot her feat ures .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s] : so t he only t hing is , of course , t here ’s t his [ disfm arker]
t his art ificial quest ion of [ disfm arker] of , uh , [ vocalsound] exact ly how
y ou [ disfm arker] how you a how you assess it
m e013 [ s] : and if [ disfm arker] if your order had been different in
t hrowing t hem out .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , it st ill isn’t necessarily really opt im al ,
m e013 [ s^ ba^ df] : but it seem s like a pret t y good heurist ic .
m e006 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So I t h I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s
kinda neat st uff .
m e013 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and , uh ,
m e013 [ s] : t he t hing t hat I want ed t o [ disfm arker] t o add t o it also
was t o hav e us use t his in a m ult i − st ream way .
m e006 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s] : so [ disfm arker] so t hat , um , [ vocalsound] when you com e
up wit h t hese different t hings , [ vocalsound] and t hese different
funct ions , [ vocalsound] you don’t necessarily just put t hem all int o
one huge vect or ,
m e013 [ s] : but perhaps [ vocalsound] you [ vocalsound] have som e of
t hem in one st ream and som e of t hem in anot her st ream , and so fort h
.
m e013 [ fh] : And , um , um , [ com m ent ] um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : And we ’v e also t alked a lit t le bit about , uh , [ vocalsound]
uh , Shihab Sham m a ’s st uff ,
m e013 [ s] : in which [ vocalsound] you [ disfm arker] t he way you look at
it is t hat t here ’s t hese different m appings
m e013 [ s] : and som e of t hem em phasize , uh , upward m oving ,
[ v ocalsound] uh , energy and fre and frequency .
m e013 [ s] : And som e are em phasizing downward
m e013 [ s^ e] : and [ vocalsound] fast t hings and slow t hings and
[ disfm arker] and [ pause] so fort h .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s] : So t here ’s a bunch of st uff t o look at .
m e013 [ s] : But , uh , I t hink we ’re sort a gonna st art off wit h what
[ v ocalsound] he , uh , cam e here wit h
m e013 [ s] : and branch out [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] branch out from
t here .

m e013 [ s] : And his advisor is here , t oo , [ vocalsound] at t he sam e
t im e .
m e013 [ fh] : So ,
m e013 [ s] : he ’ll be anot her [ pause] int erest ing source of [ pause]
wisdom .
m e006 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e006 [ s^ rt ^ t c] : As [ disfm arker] as we were t alking about t his I was
t hinking , [ v ocalsound] um , [ v ocalsound] whet her t here ’s a
relat ionship bet ween [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] um , [ vocalsound]
[ v ocalsound] bet ween Michael ’s approach t o , uh , som e [ disfm arker]
som e sort of opt im al brain dam age or opt im al brain surgeon on t he
neural net s .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e006 [ s.%−−] : So , like , if we hav e ,
m e026 [ b] : Hm m .
m e006 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s.%−−] : we have our [ disfm arker] we have our RASTA feat ures
and [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s] : and presum ably t he neural net s are [ disfm arker] are
learning som e sort of a nonlinear m apping , [ vocalsound] uh , from t he
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he feat ures [ vocalsound] t o [ disfm arker]
t o t his [ disfm arker] t his probabilit y post erior space .
m e013 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e006 [ fh|s] : And , um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] and
each of t he hidden unit s is learning som e sort of [ disfm arker] som e
sort of [ disfm arker] som e sort of pat t ern .
m e006 [ s^ f] : Right ?
m e006 [ s] : And it could be , like [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] like t hese ,
um [ disfm arker] t hese audit ory pat t erns t hat Michael [ pause] is
looking at .
m e006 [ s] : And t hen when you ’re looking at t he [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] t he , uh , [ pause] um , [ vocalsound] t he best feat ures ,
[ v ocalsound] you know , you can t ake out [ disfm arker] you can do t he
[ disfm arker] do t his , uh , brain surgery by t aking out , [ vocalsound]
um , hidden unit s t hat don’t really help at all .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ s.%−] : And t his is k sort a like [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ 2] : Or t he [ disfm arker] or feat ures .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e006 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s^ rt ] : I m ean , y act ually , you m ake m e t hink a [ disfm arker] a
v ery im port ant point here is t hat , um , [ vocalsound] if we a again t ry t o
look at how is t his different from what we ’re already doing ,
[ v ocalsound] uh , t here ’s a [ disfm arker] a , uh [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] a nast y argum ent t hat could be m ade t h t hat it ’s
[ disfm arker] it ’s not different at [ disfm arker] at all ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : because , uh [ disfm arker] if you ignore t he [ disfm arker]
t he select ion part
m e013 [ s^ df] : because we are going int o a [ disfm arker] a very
powerful , [ vocalsound] uh , nonlinearit y
m e013 [ s] : t hat , uh , in fact is com bining over t im e and frequency ,
m e013 [ s] : and is com ing up wit h it s own [ disfm arker] you know ,
bet t er t han Gabor funct ions
m e006 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : it s , y ou know , neural net funct ions ,
m e026 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ s] : it s [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] [ vocalsound] what ever it finds
t o be best .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Um , so you could argue t hat in fact it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : But I [ disfm arker] I don’t act ually believe t hat argum ent
m e013 [ s^ df.%−−] : because I know t hat , um , [ vocalsound] you can ,
uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : com put ing feat ures is useful ,
m e013 [ s] : ev en t hough [ pause] in principle you haven’t [ pause]
[ v ocalsound] added anyt hing [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : in fact , you subt ract ed som et hing , from t he original
wav eform [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : You know , uh , if you ’ve [ disfm arker] you ’ve processed it
in som e way y ou ’ve t ypically lost som et hing [ disfm arker] som e
inform at ion .
m e013 [ fh|s] : And so , [ vocalsound] you ’ve lost inform at ion and yet it
does bet t er wit h [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] wit h feat ures t han it does
wit h t he waveform .
m e013 [ fh] : So ,
m e013 [ s] : uh , I [ disfm arker] I know t hat i som et im es it ’s useful t o
[ disfm arker] [ pause] t o const rain t hings .
m e013 [ s] : So t hat ’s [ vocalsound] why it really seem s like t he
const raint [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in all t his st uff it ’s t he
const raint s t hat are act ually what m at t ers .
m e013 [ s^ df] : Because if it wasn’t [ pause] t he const raint s t hat
m at t ered , t hen we would ’ve com plet ely solved t his problem long ago ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : because long ago we already knew how t o put
wav eform s int o powerful st at ist ical m echanism s .
m e013 [ fh] : So .

m n007 [ fg|s.%−] : Yeah . Well , if we had infinit e processing power and
[ pause] dat a , [ com m ent ] I guess , using t he waveform could
[ disfm arker]
m e006 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ %−] : Yeah
m e013 [ fg] : Uh ,
m e013 [ s^ 2] : t hen it would work .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , I agree .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah . There ’s t he problem .
m n007 [ %−] : So , t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah . Then it would work .
m e013 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but , I m ean , i it ’s [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] Wit h finit e [ pause] of t hose t hings [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , uh , we [ disfm arker] we have done experim ent s
where we lit erally have put waveform s in
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and , uh ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : we kept t he num ber of param et ers t he sam e and so fort h ,
m e013 [ s] : and it used a lot of t raining dat a .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And it [ disfm arker] and it [ disfm arker] it , uh
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bd^ df] : not infinit e
m e013 [ s^ df] : but a lot , and t hen com pared t o t he num ber
param et ers [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : and it [ disfm arker] it , uh [ disfm arker] it just doesn’t do
nearly as well .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So , anyway t he point is t hat you want t o suppress
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : it ’s not just having t he m axim um inform at ion ,
m e013 [ s] : y ou want t o suppress , [ vocalsound] uh , t he aspect s of
t he input signal t hat are not helpful for [ disfm arker] for t he
discrim inat ion y ou ’re t rying t o m ake .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s^ t ^ t c.%−−] : So m aybe just briefly , uh [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s] : Well , t hat sort of segues int o [ pause] what [ disfm arker]
what I ’m doing .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e006 [ fh|s] : Um , [ vocalsound] so , uh , t he big pict ure is k um ,
[ v ocalsound] com e up wit h a set of , [ vocalsound] uh , int erm ediat e
cat egories ,
m e006 [ s] : t hen build int erm ediat e cat egory classifiers , t hen do
recognit ion ,
m e006 [ s] : and , um , im prove speech recognit ion in t hat way .

m e006 [ s] : Um , so right now I ’m in [ disfm arker] in t he phase where
[ v ocalsound] I ’m looking at [ disfm arker] at , um , deciding on a init ial
set of int erm ediat e cat egories .
m e006 [ s] : And [ v ocalsound] I ’m looking [ vocalsound] for dat a dat a −
driv en [ pause] m et hods t hat can help m e find , [ vocalsound] um , a
set of int erm ediat e cat egories [ v ocalsound] of speech t hat , uh , will
help m e t o discrim inat e [ pause] lat er down t he line .
m e006 [ s] : And one of t he ideas , [ vocalsound] um , t hat was t o t ake
a [ disfm arker] t ake a neural net [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s^ e] : t rain [ disfm arker] t rain an ordinary neural net
[ v ocalsound] t o [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] uh , t o learn t he post erior
probabilit ies of phones .
m e006 [ fh] : And so ,
m e006 [ s] : um , at t he end of t he day you have t his neural net
m e006 [ s] : and it has hidden [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] hidden unit s .
m e006 [ s] : And each of t hese hidden unit s is [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] um , is learning som e sort of pat t ern .
m e006 [ qh] : And so , um , what [ disfm arker] what are t hese pat t erns
?
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e006 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m e006 [ s.%−−] : Um , and I ’m gonna t o t ry t o [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
t o look at t hose pat t erns [ vocalsound] t o [ disfm arker] t o see ,
[ v ocalsound] um , [ vocalsound] from t hose pat t erns [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s] : uh , presum ably t hose are im port ant pat t erns for
discrim inat ing bet ween phone classes .
m e006 [ s] : And m aybe [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] m aybe som e , uh ,
int erm ediat e cat egories can com e from [ vocalsound] just looking at
t he pat t erns of [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] um , t hat t he neural net
learns .
m e013 [ s|qy^ d^ f^ g] : Be − before you get on t he next part l let m e just
point out t hat s t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s a [ disfm arker] a pret t y
nice [ com m ent ] [ vocalsound] relat ionship bet ween what you ’re t alking
about doing and what you ’re t alking about doing t here . Right ?
m e006 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So , [ v ocalsound] it seem s t o m e t hat , you know , if you
t ake away t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] [ pause] t he difference of
t his [ pause] prim ary feat ures , [ vocalsound] and , say , you use
[ disfm arker] as we had t alked about m ay be doing [ disfm arker] you use
P − RASTA − PLP or som et hing for t he [ disfm arker] t he prim ary feat ures ,
[ v ocalsound] um , t hen t his feat ure discovery , [ pause] uh , uh , t hing
[ v ocalsound] is just what he ’s t alking about doing , t oo ,
m e013 [ s] : ex cept t hat he ’s t alking about doing t hem in order t o
discov er [ pause] int erm ediat e cat egories t hat correspond
[ v ocalsound] t o t hese [ disfm arker] uh , uh , what t hese sub − feat ures
are [ disfm arker] are [ disfm arker] are [ disfm arker] are showing you .

m e013 [ s] : And , um , [ vocalsound] t he ot her difference is t hat , um ,
[ v ocalsound] he ’s doing t his in a [ disfm arker] in a m ult i − band set t ing
,
m e013 [ s|qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : which m eans t hat he ’s const raining him self
[ v ocalsound] t o look across t im e in som e f relat ively lim it ed , uh , uh ,
spect ral ex t ent . Right ?
m e013 [ s] : And whereas in [ disfm arker] in t his case you ’re saying " let
’s just do it unconst rained " .
m e013 [ s] : So t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re really pret t y relat ed
m e013 [ s] : and m aybe t hey ’ll be [ disfm arker] at som e point where we
’ll see t he [ disfm arker] t he connect ions a lit t le bet t er
m e026 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s] : and [ vocalsound] connect t hem .
m e006 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ fg] : Um .
m e006 [ fh|s] : Yeah , so [ disfm arker] so t hat ’s t he [ disfm arker] t hat ’s
t he first part [ disfm arker] uh , one [ disfm arker] one of t he ideas t o get
at som e [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] som e pat t erns of int erm ediat e
cat egories .
m e006 [ s] : Um , [ v ocalsound] t he ot her one [ pause] was ,
[ v ocalsound] um , t o , [ vocalsound] uh , com e up wit h a [ disfm arker] a
[ disfm arker] a m odel [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] um , a graphical m odel ,
[ v ocalsound] t hat t reat s [ pause] t he int erm ediat e cat egories
[ v ocalsound] as hidden [ disfm arker] hidden variables , lat ent variables
, t hat we don’t know anyt hing about ,
m e006 [ s] : but t hat t hrough , [ vocalsound] um , s st at ist ical t raining
and t he EM algorit hm , [ vocalsound] um , at t he end of t he day ,
[ v ocalsound] we have , um [ disfm arker] we have learned som et hing
about t hese [ disfm arker] t hese lat ent , um [ disfm arker] lat ent
v ariables
m e006 [ s^ e] : which happen t o correspond t o [ vocalsound]
int erm ediat e cat egories .
m e006 [ fh|s] : Um . [ v ocalsound] [ nonvocalsound] Yeah , and so t hose
are t he [ disfm arker] t he t wo direct ions t hat I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m
looking int o right now .
m e006 [ fh] : And , uh , [ vocalsound] um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
[ v ocalsound] Yeah .
m e006 [ s^ t c] : I guess t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s it .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ qy ^ cs^ rt ] : Should we do our digit s
m e013 [ s^ e^ rt ] : and get ou get our t reat s ?
m e006 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Oh , t ea t im e ?
m e013 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah . It ’s kind of like , y ou know , t he lit t le rat s wit h
t he lit t le t hing dropping down t o t hem .
m e018 [ s^ bk.%−−] : That ’s ri
m e013 [ s] : We do t he digit s and t hen we get our t reat s .

m e006 [ s^ fe] : Oops .
m e018 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : OK .
