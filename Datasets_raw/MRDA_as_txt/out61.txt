m e018 [ z] : now we ’re on .
m e013 [ z] : Yeah .
m n052 [ z] : Uh Chuck , is t he m ike t ype wireless [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ z] : Yes .
m n052 [ z] : wireless headset ?
m e018 [ z] : Yes .
m n052 [ z] : OK .
m e013 [ z] : Yeah .
m e018 [ z] : For you it is .
m e013 [ z] : Yeah .
m e013 [ z] : We uh [ disfm arker] we abandoned t he lapel
m e013 [ z] : because t hey sort of were not t oo [ disfm arker] not t oo hot
, not t oo cold ,
m e013 [ z] : t hey were [ disfm arker] you know , t hey were [ vocalsound]
uh , far enough away t hat you got m ore background noise , uh , and
uh [ disfm arker] and so fort h
m n052 [ z] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ z] : but t hey weren’t so close t hat t hey got quit e t he
[ disfm arker] you know , t he really good [ disfm arker] No , t h
m n052 [ z] : OK .
m e013 [ z] : t hey [ disfm arker] I m ean t hey didn’t [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ z] : Wait a m inut e .
m e013 [ z] : I ’m say ing t hat wrong .
m e013 [ z] : They were not so far away t hat t hey were really good
represent at iv e dist ant m ikes ,
m e013 [ z] : but on t he ot her hand t hey were not so close t hat t hey got
rid of all t he int erference .
m n052 [ z] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ z] : So it was no [ disfm arker] didn’t seem t o be a good point t o
t hem .
m e013 [ z] : On t he ot her hand if you only had t o have one m ike in
som e way s y ou could argue t he lapel was a good choice ,
m e013 [ z] : precisely because it ’s in t he m iddle .
m n052 [ z] : Yeah , y eah .
m e013 [ z] : There ’s uh , som e kinds of junk t hat you get wit h t hese
t hings t hat you don’t get wit h t he lapel
m e013 [ z] : uh , lit t le m out h clicks and breat hs and so fort h are worse
wit h t hese t han wit h t he lapel ,
m e013 [ z] : but
m e013 [ z] : giv en t he choice we [ disfm arker] t here seem ed t o be very
st rong opinions for uh , get t ing rid of lapels .
m e013 [ z] : So ,
m n052 [ z] : The m ike num ber is [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ z] : Uh , your m ike num ber ’s writ t en on t he back of t hat unit
t here .
m n052 [ z] : Oh yeah .

m n052 [ z] : One .
m e018 [ z] : And t hen t he channel num ber ’s usually one less t han t hat
.
m n052 [ z] : Oh , OK .
m e018 [ z] : It − it ’s one less t han what ’s writ t en on t he back of your
[ disfm arker]
m n052 [ z] : OK .
m n052 [ z] : OK .
m n052 [ z] : OK .
m e018 [ z] : y eah .
m e018 [ z] : So you should be zero , act ually .
m n052 [ z] : Hello ?
m n052 [ z] : Yeah .
m e018 [ z] : For y our uh , channel num ber .
m n052 [ z] : Yep , yep .
m e013 [ z] : And you should do a lot of t alking so we get a lot m ore of
y our pronunciat ions .
m e013 [ z] : no , t hey don’t [ disfm arker] don’t have a [ disfm arker] have
any Indian pronunciat ions .
m e018 [ z] : So what we usually do is um , we t ypically will have our
m eet ings
m e013 [ z] : Yeah .
m e018 [ z] : and t hen at t he end of t he m eet ings we ’ll read t he digit s .
m e018 [ z] : Ev ery body goes around and reads t he digit s on t he
[ disfm arker] t he bot t om of t heir form s .
m e013 [ z] : Session R
m n007 [ z] : R − ninet een ?
m n052 [ z] : OK .
m e013 [ z] : R − ninet een .
m e018 [ z] : Yeah .
m e018 [ z] : We ’re [ disfm arker] This is session R − ninet een .
m e013 [ z] : If you say so .
m e013 [ fg] : O K .
m e013 [ qy^ rt ^ t ] : Do we have anyt hing like an agenda ?
m e013 [ qw] : What ’s going on ?
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I guess
m e013 [ fh] : um .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Sunil ’s here for t he sum m er ?
m e013 [ s.%−] : One t hing [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ m ^ na] : Sunil ’s here for t he sum m er ,
m e013 [ s^ aa] : right .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s^ t ] : so , one t hing is t o t alk about a kick off m eet ing
m e013 [ s^ am ^ e] : m aybe

m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ s^ t ] : and t hen just uh , I guess uh , progress report s
indiv idually , and t hen uh , plans for where we go bet ween now and
t hen , pret t y m uch .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : I could say a few words about um , som e of t he uh ,
com put e st uff t hat ’s happening around here ,
m e018 [ s^ df] : so t hat people in t he group know .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ qw^ co] : Why don’t you st art wit h t hat ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : That ’s sort of [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ fh] : We um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah ?
m e018 [ s] : So we just put in an order for about t welve new m achines ,
uh , t o use as sort of a com put e farm .
m e018 [ fh] : And um ,
m e018 [ s] : uh , we ordered uh , SUN − Blade − one − hundreds ,
m e018 [ fh] : and um ,
m e018 [ s] : I ’m not sure exact ly how long it ’ll t ake for t hose t o com e
in ,
m e018 [ s.%−−] : but , uh , in addit ion , we ’re running [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : So t he plan for using t hese is , uh , we ’re running P −
m ake and Cust om s here
m e018 [ s] : and Andreas has sort of got t en t hat all uh , fixed up and
up t o speed .
m e018 [ s] : And he ’s got a num ber of lit t le ut ilit ies t hat m ake it very
easy t o um , [ v ocalsound] run t hings using P − m ake and Cust om s .
m e018 [ s^ df] : You don’t act ually have t o writ e P − m ake script s and
t hings like t hat .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : The sim plest t hing [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ cs] : And I can send an em ail around
m e018 [ s^ cs] : or , m aybe I should do an FAQ on t he web sit e about it
or som et hing .
m e018 [ fh] : Um ,
m e018 [ s.%−] : t here ’s a c
m e013 [ qw^ cs] : How about an em ail t hat point s t o t he FAQ ,
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
m e013 [ qy ^ f] : you know what I ’m saying ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : so t hat you can [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : Uh , t here ’s a com m and , uh , t hat you can use called "
run com m and " .
m e018 [ s^ e] : " Run dash com m and " ,
m e018 [ s^ bsc^ e] : " run hyphen com m and " .

m e018 [ s] : And , if y ou say t hat and t hen som e job t hat you want t o
ex ecut e , uh , it will find t he fast est current ly available m achine , and
ex port y our job t o t hat m achine ,
m e018 [ fh|s] : and uh [ disfm arker] and run it t here
m e018 [ s] : and it ’ll duplicat e your environm ent .
m e018 [ fh] : So
m e018 [ s] : y ou can t ry t his as a sim ple t est wit h uh , t he L S com m and
.
m e018 [ s^ e] : So you can say " run dash com m and L S " ,
m e018 [ fh|s^ e] : and , um , it ’ll act ually export t hat [ vocalsound] LS
com m and t o som e m achine in t he inst it ut e , and um , do an LS on your
current direct ory .
m e018 [ s^ bs] : So , subst it ut e LS for what ever com m and you want t o
run ,
m e018 [ fh|s] : and um [ disfm arker] And t hat ’s a sim ple way t o get
st art ed using [ disfm arker] using t his .
m e018 [ s] : And , so , soon , when we get all t he new m achines up ,
[ v ocalsound] um , e t hen we ’ll have lot s m ore com put e t o use .
m e018 [ s] : Now t h one of t he nice t hings is t hat uh , each m achine
t hat ’s part of t he P − m ake and Cust om s net work has at t ribut es
associat ed wit h it .
m e018 [ fh|s^ e] : Uh , at t ribut es like how m uch m em ory t he m achine
has ,
m e018 [ s^ e] : what it s speed is ,
m e018 [ s^ e] : what it s operat ing syst em ,
m e018 [ s] : and when you use som et hing like " run com m and " , you
can specify t hose at t ribut es for your program .
m e018 [ s^ e] : For exam ple if y ou only want your t hing t o run under
Linux , you can giv e it t he Linux at t ribut e ,
m e018 [ s^ e] : and t hen it will find t he fast est available Linux m achine
and run it on t hat .
m e018 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ s] : You can cont rol where y our jobs go , t o a cert ain ext ent ,
m e018 [ s^ e] : all t he way down t o an indiv idual m achine .
m e018 [ s] : Each m achine has an at t ribut e which is t he nam e of it self .
m e018 [ s] : So you can give t hat as an at t ribut e and it ’ll only run on
t hat .
m e018 [ s] : If t here ’s already a job running , on som e m achine t hat
y ou ’re t ry ing t o select , your job will get queued up ,
m e018 [ s] : and t hen when t hat resource , t hat m achine becom es
av ailable , y our job will get export ed t here .
m e018 [ fh] : So ,
m e018 [ s] : t here ’s a lot of nice feat ures t o it
m e018 [ s] : and it kinda helps t o balance t he load of t he m achines
m e018 [ fh] : and uh ,
m e018 [ s] : right now Andreas and I have been t he m ain ones using it

m e018 [ %−−] : and we ’re [ disfm arker] Uh .
m e018 [ s] : The SRI recognizer has all t his P − m ake cust om s st uff built
int o it .
m e018 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So as I underst and , you know , he ’s using all t he
m achines and you ’re using all t he m achines ,
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e.%−−] : is t he rough division of [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Exact ly .
m e018 [ fg|s] : Yeah , you know , I [ disfm arker] I sort of got st art ed
[ com m ent ] using t he recognizer just recent ly
m e018 [ fh] : and uh ,
m e018 [ s] : uh I fired off a t raining job ,
m e018 [ s] : and t hen I fired off a recognit ion job
m e018 [ s:qy ] : and I get t his em ail about m idnight from Andreas saying
, " uh , are y ou running t wo [ vocalsound] t rainings sim ult aneously
m e018 [ s:s] : s m y m m y jobs are not get t ing run . "
m e018 [ s] : So I had t o back off a lit t le bit .
m e018 [ fh] : But ,
m e018 [ s] : soon as we get som e m ore m achines t hen uh [ disfm arker]
t hen we ’ll have m ore com put e av ailable .
m e018 [ fh] : So ,
m e018 [ fh] : um ,
m e018 [ s] : t hat ’s just a quick updat e about what we ’ve got .
m e006 [ fg|s^ rt ] : Um , I have [ disfm arker] I have a quest ion about t he
uh , parallelizat ion ?
m e018 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ fh|s] : So , um , let ’s say I have like , a t housand lit t le
[ disfm arker] lit t le jobs t o do ?
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ fh|qw] : Um , how do I do it wit h " run com m and " ?
m e006 [ s.%−−] : I m ean do [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : You could writ e a script uh , which called run com m and on
each sub − job
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m e006 [ qy ^ 2^ d] : A t housand t im es ?
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
m e006 [ b] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : But you probably wanna be careful wit h t hat
m e018 [ s^ df] : because um , you don’t wanna sat urat e t he net work .
m e018 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e018 [ fh] : so , um ,
m e018 [ s^ cs] : y ou know , you should [ disfm arker] you should
probably not run m ore t han , say t en jobs yourself at any one t im e ,

m e018 [ s^ df.%−] : uh , just because t hen it would keep ot her people
[ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Oh ,
m e006 [ s] : t oo m uch file t ransfer and st uff .
m e018 [ s^ nd] : Well it ’s not t hat so m uch as t hat , you know , e wit h
[ disfm arker] if ev ery body ran fift y jobs at once t hen it would just bring
ev ery t hing t o a halt
m e018 [ s] : and , you know , people ’s jobs would get delayed ,
m e018 [ s^ nd] : so it ’s sort of a sharing t hing .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ fh] : Um ,
m e018 [ s^ cs] : so y ou should t ry t o lim it it t o som et som et im som e
num ber around t en jobs at a t im e .
m e018 [ fh] : Um .
m e018 [ s^ e] : So if you had a script for exam ple t hat had a t housand
t hings it needed t o run , um , you ’d som ehow need t o put som e logic
in t here if you were gonna use " run com m and " , uh , t o only have t en
of t hose going at a t im e .
m e018 [ s^ e] : And uh , t hen , when one of t hose finished you ’d fire off
anot her one .
m e018 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s^ t c] : I rem em ber I [ disfm arker] I forget whet her it was when
t he Rut gers or [ disfm arker] or Hopkins workshop ,
m e013 [ s] : I rem em ber one of t he workshops I was at t here were
[ disfm arker] everybody was real ex cit ed cuz t hey got t went y − five
m achines
m e013 [ s] : and t here was som e kind of P − m ake like t hing t hat sit
sent t hings out .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So all t went y − five people were sending t hings t o all t went y
− fiv e m achines
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : and [ v ocalsound] and t hings were a lot less efficient t han
if y ou ’d just use your own m achine .
m e018 [ b] : Yep .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , exact ly .
m e018 [ s] : Yeah , you have t o be a lit t le bit careful .
m e013 [ s^ e] : as I recall ,
m e013 [ fh] : but .
m n007 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fg] : Um ,
m e018 [ s^ t c.%−−] : but uh , you can also [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ s] : If you have t hat level of parallelizat ion um , and you don’t
wanna hav e t o worry about writ ing t he logic in [ disfm arker] in a Perl
script t o t ake care of t hat , you can use um , P − m ake
m e006 [ s^ 2] : Just do P − m ake .
m e018 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and y ou basically writ e a Make file t hat uh
, you know y our final job depends on t hese one t housand t hings ,
m e006 [ %] : s
m e006 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : and when you run P − m ake , uh , on your Make file ,
y ou can give it t he dash capit al J and [ disfm arker] and t hen a num ber ,
m e006 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : and t hat num ber represent s how m any uh , m achines t o
use at once .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e018 [ s] : And t hen it ’ll m ake sure t hat it nev er goes above t hat .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ fh] : So ,
m e018 [ s] : I can get som e docum ent at ion .
m n007 [ s] : So it [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not syst em at ically
queued .
m n007 [ s^ df] : I m ean all t he jobs are running .
m n007 [ s^ e] : If you launch t went y jobs , t hey are all running .
m e018 [ s^ am ] : It depends .
m n007 [ fh] : Alright .
m e018 [ s^ df] : If you [ disfm arker] " Run com m and " , t hat I m ent ioned
before , is [ disfm arker] doesn’t know about ot her t hings t hat you m ight
be running .
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ s^ df] : So , it would be possible t o run a hundred run jobs at
once ,
m n007 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s^ df] : and t hey wouldn’t know about each ot her .
m e018 [ s^ df] : But if you use P − m ake , t hen , it knows about all t he
jobs t hat it has t o run
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ df] : and it can cont rol , uh , how m any it runs
sim ult aneously .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d|qrr.%−−] : So " run com m and " doesn’t use P − m ake ,
or [ disfm arker] ?
m e018 [ s] : It uses " export " underly ingly .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : But , if you [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : i It ’s m eant t o be run one job at a t im e ?
m e018 [ s^ e] : So you could fire off a t housand of t hose ,
m e018 [ s^ e] : and it doesn’t know [ disfm arker] any one of t hose
doesn’t know about t he ot her ones t hat are running .

m e013 [ qw] : So why would one use t hat rat her t han P − m ake ?
m e018 [ s.%−−] : Well , if you have ,
m e018 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : Like , for exam ple , uh if you didn’t wanna writ e a P − m ake
script
m e018 [ s] : and y ou just had a , uh [ disfm arker] an HTK t raining job
t hat y ou know is gonna t ake uh , six hours t o run ,
m e018 [ s] : and som ebody ’s using , uh , t he m achine you t ypically use
,
m e018 [ s] : y ou can say " run com m and " and your HTK t hing
m e018 [ s] : and it ’ll find anot her m achine ,
m e018 [ s^ e] : t he fast est current ly available m achine
m e018 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and run your job t here .
m e013 [ qy ] : Now , does it have t he sam e sort of behavior as P − m ake
,
m e013 [ s^ e.%−−] : which is t hat , you know , if you run som et hing on
som ebody ’s m achine and t hey com e in and hit a key t hen it
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e018 [ s.%−−] : t here are um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e018 [ s] : So som e of t he m achines at t he inst it ut e , um , have t his
at t ribut e called " no evict " .
m e018 [ s] : And if you specify t hat , in [ disfm arker] in one of your
at t ribut e lines , t hen it ’ll go t o a m achine which your job won’t be
ev ict ed from .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : But , t he m achines t hat don’t have t hat at t ribut e , if a job
get s fired up on t hat , which could be som ebody ’s deskt op m achine ,
and [ disfm arker] and t hey were at lunch ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : t hey com e back from lunch and t hey st art t yping on t he
console , t hen y our m achine will get evict ed [ disfm arker] your job
[ com m ent ] will get evict ed from t heir m achine and be rest art ed on
anot her m achine . Aut om at ically .
m e018 [ s^ e] : So [ disfm arker] which can cause you t o lose t im e ,
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
m e018 [ s^ e] : If y ou had a t wo hour job , and it got halfway t hrough
m e018 [ s^ e] : and t hen som ebody cam e back t o t heir m achine and it
got ev ict ed .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : So . If you don’t want y our job t o run on a m achine
where it could be ev ict ed , t hen y ou give it t he m inus [ disfm arker] t he
at t ribut e , y ou know , " no evict " ,
m e018 [ s] : and it ’ll pick a m achine t hat it can’t be evict ed from .
m e018 [ fh] : So .

m e013 [ fg|qw.%−−] : Um , what [ disfm arker] what about [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I rem em ber always used t o be an issue , m aybe it ’s not
anym ore , t hat if y ou [ disfm arker] if som et hing required [ disfm arker] if
y our m achine required som ebody hit t ing a key in order t o evict t hings
t hat are on it so y ou could work ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qw^ d^ rt ] : but if you were logged int o it from hom e ?
m e013 [ s^ e] : and y ou weren’t hit t ing any keys ? cuz you were , hom e ?
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e018 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I ’m not sure how t hat works .
m e018 [ s] : Uh , it seem s like Andreas did som et hing for t hat .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : We can ask him som et im e .
m e018 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ no] : I don’t know whet her it m onit ors t he keyboard or
act ually looks at t he console TTY ,
m e018 [ s^ cs] : so m aybe if you echoed som et hing t o t he you know ,
dev [ disfm arker] dev console or som et hing .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : You probably wouldn’t ordinarily , t hough .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Yeah . Right ?
m e018 [ qw^ br] : Hm m ?
m e013 [ s^ r] : You probably wouldn’t ordinarily .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean you sort of [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : y ou ’re at hom e and y ou ’re t rying t o log in ,
m e013 [ s] : and it t akes forever t o ev en log you in ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah .
m e013 [ s] : and you probably go , " screw t his " ,
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] You know .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fg] : Yeah ,
m e018 [ fh] : so , um ,
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fh] : yeah .
m e018 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I can [ disfm arker] I ’m not sure about
t hat one .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : y eah .
m e018 [ fh] : But uh .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ s] : Uh , I need a lit t le orient at ion about t his environm ent and
uh scr s how t o run som e jobs here
m n052 [ s^ df] : because I never d did any t hing so far wit h t his X

m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ fh] : So ,
m n052 [ s^ cc] : I t hink m aybe I ’ll ask you aft er t he m eet ing .
m e018 [ fg] : Um .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : Yeah , and [ disfm arker] and also uh , St ephane ’s a
[ disfm arker] a really good resource for t hat if you can’t find m e .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Yep .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n052 [ s^ bk] : sure
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e018 [ s^ e] : Especially wit h regard t o t he Aurora st uff .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s] : He [ disfm arker] he knows t hat st uff bet t er t han I do .
m e013 [ fg] : OK .
m e013 [ qw^ cs.%−−] : Well , why don’t we uh ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ qw^ cs^ t c] : Sunil since you ’re [ vocalsound] haven’t
[ disfm arker] hav en’t been at one of t hese yet , why don’t yo you t ell us
what ’s [ disfm arker] what ’s up wit h y ou ?
m e013 [ s^ e] : Wh − what you ’ve been up t o , hopefully .
m n052 [ h] : Um .
m n052 [ h] : Yeah .
m n052 [ h] : So ,
m n052 [ qy.%−−] : uh , shall I st art from [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ no.%−−] : Well I don’t know how m ay I [ disfm arker] how
[ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ s^ cc] : Uh , I t hink I ’ll st art from t he post uh Aurora
subm ission m ay be .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n052 [ fh] : Uh , y eah ,
m n052 [ s] : aft er t he subm ission t he [ disfm arker] what I ’ve been
working on m ainly was t o t ake [ disfm arker] t ake ot her s subm issions
m n052 [ s.%−−] : and t hen
m n052 [ s] : over t heir syst em , what t hey subm it t ed ,
m n052 [ s^ df] : because we didn’t have any speech enhancem ent
sy st em in [ disfm arker] in ours .
m n052 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s.%−−] : So I t ried
m n052 [ fh] : uh ,
m n052 [ s] : And u First I t ried just LDA .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : And t hen I found t hat
m n052 [ fh] : uh ,

m n052 [ s] : I m ean , if [ disfm arker] if I com bine it wit h LDA , it gives @
@ im prov em ent ov er t heirs .
m n052 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy] : Are y are you saying LDA ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : LDA .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ fg] : So ,
m n052 [ s] : just [ disfm arker] just t he LDA filt ers .
m n052 [ s] : I just plug in [ disfm arker] I just t ake t he cepst ral
coefficient s com ing from t heir syst em and t hen plug in LDA on t op of
t hat .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : But t he LDA filt er t hat I used was different from what we
subm it t ed in t he proposal .
m n052 [ s] : What I did was [ vocalsound] I t ook t he LDA filt er ’s design
using clean speech ,
m n052 [ fh|s^ df] : uh , m ainly because t he speech is already cleaned
up aft er t he enhancem ent
m n052 [ s] : so , inst ead of using t his , uh , narrow [ disfm arker] narrow
band LDA filt er t hat we subm it t ed uh , I got new filt ers .
m n052 [ fh] : So
m n052 [ s] : t hat seem s t o be giving [ disfm arker] uh , im proving over
t heir uh , sy st em .
m n052 [ s^ e] : Slight ly .
m n052 [ s^ e] : But , not very significant ly .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : And uh , t hat was
m n052 [ s] : uh , showing any im prov em ent over [ disfm arker] final
[ disfm arker] by plugging in an LDA .
m n052 [ fh] : And uh ,
m n052 [ s] : so t hen aft er [ disfm arker] aft er t hat I [ disfm arker] I added
uh , on − line norm alizat ion also on t op of t hat .
m n052 [ s] : And t hat [ disfm arker] t here [ disfm arker] t here also I n I
found t hat I have t o m ake som e changes t o t heir t im e const ant t hat I
used
m n052 [ s^ df] : because t h it has a [ disfm arker] a m ean and variance
updat e t im e const ant
m n052 [ s^ e] : and [ disfm arker] which is not suit able for t he enhanced
speech , and what ev er we t ry it on wit h proposal − one .
m n052 [ fh] : But um ,
m n052 [ s] : I didn’t [ disfm arker] I didn’t play wit h t hat t im e const ant a
lot ,
m n052 [ s.%−−] : I just t g
m n052 [ s] : I just found t hat I have t o reduce t he value [ disfm arker]

m n052 [ s] : I m ean , I have t o increase t he t im e const ant , or reduce
t he v alue of t he updat e value .
m n052 [ s] : That ’s all I found
m n052 [ s.%−−] : So I have t o .
m n052 [ fh] : Uh ,
m n052 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n052 [ fh] : And uh ,
m n052 [ s] : uh , t he ot her [ disfm arker] ot her t hing what I t ried was , I
just um , uh , t ook t he baseline and t hen ran it wit h t he endpoint inf uh
t h inform at ion ,
m n052 [ s^ e] : just t he Aurora baseline ,
m n052 [ s^ e] : t o see t hat how m uch t he baseline it self im proves
m n052 [ s^ e] : by just supplying t he inform at ion of t he [ disfm arker] I
m ean t he w speech and nonspeech .
m n052 [ fh] : And uh ,
m n052 [ s.%−−] : I found t hat t he baseline it self im proves by t went y − t wo
percent by just giv ing t he wuh .
m e013 [ qy ^ br^ cs] : Uh , can you back up a second ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I m issed som et hing ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : I guess m y m ind wandered .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Ad − ad When you added t he on − line norm alizat ion
and so fort h , uh , uh t hings got bet t er again ?
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qrr.%−−] : or is it ?
m n052 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n052 [ s^ ar^ r] : No .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu] : Did it not ?
m n052 [ s^ nd] : No , t hings didn’t get bet t er wit h t he sam e t im e
const ant t hat we used .
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No , no .
m e013 [ s^ ng] : Wit h a different t im e const ant .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : Wit h t he different t im e const ant I found t hat
[ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ nd] : I m ean , I didn’t get an im provem ent over not using on
− line norm alizat ion ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : No you didn’t ,
m n052 [ s^ df] : because I [ disfm arker] I found t hat I would have
change t he value of t he updat e fact or .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : But I didn’t play it wit h play [ disfm arker] play quit e a bit
t o m ake it bet t er t han .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ s] : So , it ’s st ill not [ disfm arker]

m n052 [ s] : I m ean , t he on − line norm alizat ion didn’t give m e any
im provem ent .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ fh] : And uh ,
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m n052 [ fh] : so ,
m n052 [ s^ bk] : oh y eah
m n052 [ s] : So I just st opped t here wit h t he uh , speech enhancem ent
.
m n052 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he ot her t hing what I t ried was t he
[ disfm arker] adding t he uh , endpoint inform at ion t o t he baseline
m n052 [ s] : and t hat it self gives like t went y − t wo percent
m n052 [ s^ df] : because t he [ disfm arker] t he second [ disfm arker] t he
new phase is going t o be wit h t he endpoint ed speech .
m n052 [ s.%−] : And just t o get a feel of how m uch t he baseline it self is
going t o change by adding t his endpoint inform at ion , I just , uh , use
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : So people won’t ev en hav e t o worry about , uh , doing
speech − nonspeech t hen .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah
m n052 [ s^ na] : t hat ’s , t hat ’s what t he feeling is like .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm m .
m n052 [ s] : They ’re going t o give t he endpoint inform at ion .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ s] : G I guess t he issue is t hat people do t hat anyway ,
m e013 [ s] : ev ery body does t hat ,
m e013 [ s] : and t hey want ed t o see , given t hat you ’re doing t hat ,
what [ disfm arker] what are t he best feat ures t hat you should use .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n052 [ fg] : So ,
m e013 [ s] : I m ean clearly t hey ’re int eract .
m e013 [ s] : So I don’t know t hat I ent irely agree wit h it .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : But [ disfm arker] but it m ight be uh [ disfm arker] In
som e way s it m ight be bet t er t t o [ disfm arker] rat her t han giving t he
endpoint s , t o have a st andard t hat everybody uses and t hen int eract s
wit h .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : But , y ou know . It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s st ill som et h
reasonable .
m e018 [ qy.%−−] : So , are people supposed t o assum e t hat t here is uh
[ disfm arker]

m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Are [ disfm arker] are people not supposed t o use any
speech out side of t hose endpoint s ?
m n052 [ h] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qrr] : Or can you t hen use speech out side of it for est im at ing
background noise and t hings ?
m n052 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n052 [ s^ ar^ r] : No .
m n052 [ %−−] : That i I [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yeah , yeah ,
m n052 [ s^ aa] : ex act ly .
m n052 [ s^ na] : I guess t hat is [ disfm arker] t hat is where t he
consensus is .
m n052 [ s] : Like y y ou will [ disfm arker] you will [ disfm arker] You ’ll be
giv en t he inform at ion about t he beginning and t he end of speech
m n052 [ s] : but t he whole speech is available t o you .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s] : So it should m ake t he spect ral subt ract ion st yle t hings
work ev en bet t er ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : because you don’t hav e t he m ist akes in it .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Yeah ?
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ b] : So [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s.%−−] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] The baseline
it self [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : I m ean , it im proves by t went y − t wo percent .
m n052 [ s] : I found t hat in s one of t he SpeechDat − Car cases , t hat
like , t he Spanish one im proves by just fift y percent by just put t ing t he
endpoint .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Wow .
m n052 [ %−−] : w
m n052 [ s^ e] : I m ean you don’t need any furt her speech
enhancem ent wit h fift y .
m n052 [ fh] : So , uh ,
m e018 [ s^ bu] : So t he baseline it self im proves by fift y percent .
m n052 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , by fift y percent .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s g it ’s gonna be harder t o [ vocalsound] beat t hat
act ually .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Wow .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker]

m n052 [ fg] : so [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : so t hat is when uh , t he [ disfm arker] t he qualificat ion
crit eria was reduced from fift y percent t o som et hing like t went y − five
percent for well − m at ched .
m n052 [ s] : And I t hink t hey have [ disfm arker] t hey have act ually
changed t heir qualificat ion c crit eria now .
m n052 [ fh] : And uh ,
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n052 [ s] : I guess aft er t hat , I just went hom e f I just had a vacat ion
fo for four weeks .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ fh] : Uh .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : No , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a
good [ disfm arker] good updat e .
m n052 [ %−−] : Ye
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n052 [ s] : and I [ disfm arker] I cam e back and I st art ed working on uh
, som e ot her speech enhancem ent algorit hm .
m n052 [ s] : I m ean , so [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] from t he subm ission
what I found t hat people have t ried spect ral subt ract ion and Wiener
filt ering . These are t he m ain uh , approaches where people have t ried
,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : so just t o [ disfm arker] just t o fill t he space wit h som e f few
m ore speech enhancem ent algorit hm s t o see whet her it im proves a lot
, I [ disfm arker] I ’ve been working on t his uh , signal subspace
approach for speech enhancem ent
m n052 [ s^ e] : where you t ake t he noisy signal and t hen decom posing
t he signal s and t he noise subspace
m n052 [ s] : and t hen t ry t o est im at e t he clean speech from t he signal
plus noise subspace .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s.%−−] : So , I ’ve been act ually running som e s
m n052 [ s] : So far I ’ve been t rying it only on Mat lab .
m n052 [ s] : I have t o [ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker] t o t est whet her it
works first or not
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : and t hen I ’ll p port it t o C
m n052 [ s] : and I ’ll updat e it wit h t he reposit ory once I find it it giving
any som e posit ive result .
m n052 [ fh] : So , yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : S
m e013 [ s] : So y ou s you So you said one t hing I want t o jum p on for a

m e013 [ s^ bu] : So [ disfm arker] so now y ou ’re [ disfm arker] you ’re
get t ing t uned int o t he reposit ory t hing t hat he has here
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : and [ disfm arker] so we we ’ll have a [ vocalsound]
single place where t he st uff is .
m n052 [ b] : Yep .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Cool .
m e013 [ fg] : Um ,
m e013 [ s^ co^ t c] : so m aybe uh , just briefly , you could rem ind us
about t he relat ed experim ent s .
m e013 [ s^ bu^ df] : Cuz you did som e st uff t hat you t alked about last
week ,
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : I guess ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s^ e.%−−] : Um , where you were also com bining som et hing
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : bot h of you I guess were bot h com bining som et hing
from t he uh , French Telecom syst em wit h [ vocalsound] t he u uh
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ bu^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know whet her it was syst em
one or syst em t wo ,
m e013 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ h] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : It was syst em one .
m n007 [ fh] : So
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ %−−] : we [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : The m ain t hing t hat we did is just t o t ake t he spect ral
subt ract ion from t he France Telecom ,
m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : which provide us som e speech sam ples t hat are uh ,
wit h noise rem ov ed .
m e013 [ s^ co] : So I let m e [ disfm arker] let m e just st op you t here .
m e013 [ s^ bu.%−] : So t hen , one dist inct ion is t hat uh , you were
t aking t he act ual France Telecom feat ures and t hen applying
som et hing t o [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ h|s^ ar] : Uh , no
m n052 [ s^ arp] : t here is a slight different .
m n052 [ fh] : Uh
m n052 [ s] : I m ean , which are ext ract ed at t he handset
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ df] : because t hey had anot her back − end blind
equalizat ion [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : But t hat ’s what I m ean .

m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : But u u
m e013 [ s^ fa] : Sorry ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : yeah , I ’m not being [ disfm arker] I ’m not being clear .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g] : What I m eant was you had som et hing like
cepst ra or som et hing , right ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And so one difference is t hat , I guess you were t aking
spect ra .
m n052 [ s^ 2] : The speech .
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : But I guess it ’s t he s ex act ly t he sam e t hing
m n007 [ s^ bu^ df] : because on t he heads uh , handset t hey just
applied t his Wiener filt er and t hen com put e cepst ral feat ures ,
m n007 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m n052 [ s^ df] : t he cepst ral f The difference is like [ disfm arker] There
m ay be a slight difference in t he way [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ df] : because t hey use exact ly t he baseline syst em for
conv ert ing t he cepst rum once y ou have t he speech .
m n007 [ b] : Right .
m n052 [ s] : I m ean , if we are using our own code for t h I m ean t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat could be t he only difference .
m n052 [ s] : I m ean , t here is no ot her difference .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ng] : But you got som e sort of different result .
m e013 [ s^ df] : So I ’m t rying t o underst and it .
m e013 [ fh] : But uh ,
m n007 [ s^ bk|s^ cs] : Yeah , well I t hink we should uh , have a t able
wit h all t he result
m e013 [ %] : I t h
m n007 [ s^ df^ no] : because I don’t know I uh , I don’t exact ly know
what are your result s ?
m n007 [ fh] : But ,
m n052 [ s^ aa] : OK .
m n052 [ s^ aa^ r] : OK .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ fg|s] : Yeah , but so we did t his ,
m n007 [ s] : and anot her difference I guess is t hat we just applied uh ,
proposal − one syst em aft er t his

m n007 [ s^ e] : wit hout [ disfm arker] well , wit h our m odificat ion t o
reduce t he delay of t he [ disfm arker] t he LDA filt ers ,
m n007 [ fh] : and
m n052 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ s] : Well t here are slight m odificat ions ,
fn002 [ s.%−] : And t he filt er [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : but it was t he full proposal − one .
m n007 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : In your case , if you t ried just put t ing LDA , t hen
m ay be on − line norm alizat ion [ disfm arker] ?
m n052 [ s^ 2] : Only LDA .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : Af − I [ disfm arker] aft er t hat I added on − line norm alizat ion ,
m n052 [ fh] : yeah .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : So we just t ried direct ly t o [ disfm arker] t o just , keep
t he sy st em as it was
m n007 [ fh] : and ,
m n007 [ fh] : um ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : when we plug t he spect ral subt ract ion it im proves uh ,
signif significant ly .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s] : but , what seem s clear also is t hat we have t o ret une t he
t im e const ant s of t he on − line norm alizat ion .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah , yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ df] : Because if we keep t he v alue t hat was subm it t ed uh , it
doesn’t help at all .
m n007 [ s^ df] : You can rem ove on − line norm alizat ion , or put it , it
doesn’t change anyt hing .
m n007 [ s^ e] : Uh , uh , as long as you have t he spect ral subt ract ion .
m n007 [ s] : But , you can st ill find som e kind of opt im um som ewhere ,
m n007 [ s^ no] : and we don’t know where exact ly
m n007 [ fh] : but ,
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : uh .
m n052 [ s^ na] : Yeah , I assum e .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : So it sounds like y ou should look at som e t ables of
result s or som et hing
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and see where i where t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
where t hey were different and what we can learn from it .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : so , um ,
m e013 [ s] : it seem s t o m e t hat t he well − m at ched condit ion is gonna

m e013 [ s^ e] : in t his case .
m n052 [ s^ bu] : Usual .
m e013 [ s^ nd] : Unusual .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s^ df^ rt ] : Because , um , you don’t act ually have good

m e013 [ fh] : or
m n052 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m n052 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : It seem s like som et hing like t he m iddle one is [ disfm arker]

m n052 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s^ no.%−−] : So I don’t know why t he [ pause] well − m at ched is
m n052 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ %] : uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , but act ually t he well [ disfm arker] well t he well
− m at ched
m n052 [ fh] : um ,
m n052 [ fh] : uh ,
m n052 [ s] : I m ean t he [ disfm arker] t he well − m at ched condit ion is not
like , uh , t he one in TI − digit s
m n052 [ s^ e] : where uh , you hav e all t he t raining , uh , condit ions
ex act ly like replicat ed in t he t est ing condit ion also .
m n052 [ s] : It ’s like , t his is not calibrat ed by SNR or som et hing .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : The well − m at ched has also som e [ disfm arker] som e
m ism at ch in t hat which is ot her t han t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : The well wa m at ched has m ism at ch ?
m n052 [ s^ aap] : has [ disfm arker] has also som e slight m ism at ches ,
m n052 [ s^ e] : unlike t he TI − digit s where it ’s like prefect ly m at ched
m e018 [ s^ 2] : Perfect t o m at ch .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ df] : because it ’s art ificially added noise .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : But t his is nat ural recording .
m e013 [ s^ co] : So rem ind m e of what well − m at ched m eant ?
m e013 [ s] : You ’ve t old m e m any t im es .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : The [ disfm arker] t he well − m at ched is like [ disfm arker]

m n052 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] t he well − m at ched is defined like it ’s
sev ent y percent of t he whole dat abase is used for t raining and t hirt y
percent for t est ing .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : Well , so it m eans t hat if t he dat abase is large enough , it
’s m at ched .
m n052 [ %−] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Because it
m n052 [ b] : OK ,
m n052 [ %−−] : it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ df] : in each set you hav e a range of condit ions [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Well [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ fh] : So , I m ean ,
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : yeah , unless t hey deliberat ely chose it t o be
different , which t hey didn’t because t hey want it t o be well − m at ched ,
m e013 [ s] : it is pret t y m uch [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : You know , so it ’s [ disfm arker] so it ’s sort of saying if
y ou [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not guarant eed t hough .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ h|s^ na] : Uh , it ’s not guarant eed .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ aa^ r] : Right .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : Yeah because t he m t he m ain [ disfm arker] m ajor

m n052 [ s] : t he m ain m ism at ch is com ing from t he am ount of noise
and t he silence fram es and all t hose present in t he dat abase act ually .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Again , if you have enough [ disfm arker] if you have

m n052 [ %−−] : No
m n052 [ s^ aa] : y eah , yeah .
m n052 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s:s^ bk] : So it ’s sort of i i it ’s sort of saying OK ,
m e013 [ s:s] : so you [ disfm arker] m uch as you t rain your dict at ion
m achine for t alking int o your com put er , um , you [ disfm arker] you
have a car ,
m e013 [ s:s] : and so you drive it around a bunch and [ disfm arker] and

m e013 [ s^ ba] : and t hen [ disfm arker] I don’t t hink t hat ’s very realist ic
,

m e013 [ fh] : I [ disfm arker] I you know ,

m e013 [ fh] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] you know ,
m e013 [ s] : I guess t hey ’re saying t hat if y ou were a com pany t hat was
selling t he st uff com m ercially , t hat you would have a bunch of people

m e013 [ s^ am ] : and m aybe t hat ’s t he argum ent ,
m e013 [ s^ ng] : but I ’m not sure I buy it ,
m e013 [ fh] : so .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah , y eah , yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e013 [ fh] : So
m e013 [ qw^ t c] : What else is going on ?
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ %−−] : You
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : We are playing [ disfm arker] we are also playing , t rying t o
put ot her spect ral subt ract ion m m m , in t he code .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : it would be a very sim ple spect ral subt ract ion , on t he
um , m el energies
m n007 [ s^ e] : which I already t est ed but wit hout t he um fram e

m n007 [ s] : and I t hink it ’s im port ant t o have fram e dropping if you
use spect ral subt ract ion .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Is it [ disfm arker] is spect ral subt ract ion t ypically done
on t he [ disfm arker] aft er t he m el , uh , scaling
m e018 [ qrr] : or is it done on t he FFT bins ?
m n007 [ h] : Um ,
m e018 [ qy] : Does it m at t er ,
m e018 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ %−−] : I d
m n007 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Well , it ’s bot h [ disfm arker] bot h uh , cases can i
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : So − som e of t he proposal , uh , we ’re doing t his on t he

m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : ot hers on t he um , m el energies .
m n007 [ s] : You can do bot h ,
m n007 [ s^ no] : but I cannot t ell you what ’s [ disfm arker] which one
m ight be bet t er
m n007 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ s^ bk] : Hm m .
m n007 [ %−−] : I [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ cs] : I guess if you want t o reconst ruct t he speech , it m ay
be a good idea t o do it on FFT bins .
m n007 [ fh] : I don’t know .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ fh] : but
m n052 [ s] : But for speech recognit ion , it m ay not .
m n052 [ s^ df] : I m ean it m ay not be v ery different if you do it on m el
warped or whet her you do it on FFT .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n052 [ s] : So you ’re going t o do a linear weight ing anyway aft er t hat
.
m n052 [ fh] : Well [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ fh] : Yeah ?
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m n052 [ s] : So , it m ay not be really a big different .
m n007 [ s^ nd] : Well , it gives som et hing different ,
m n007 [ s^ df^ no] : but I don’t know what are t he , pros and cons of
bot h .
m n052 [ %−] : It
m n052 [ b] : I Uh − huh .
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
m n052 [ z] : So
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ s^ t c] : The ot her t hing is like when you ’re put t ing in a speech

m n052 [ fh] : uh ,
m n052 [ qy] : is it like one st age speech enhancem ent ?
m n052 [ s^ df] : Because everybody seem s t o have a m od t wo st ages of

m n052 [ s^ e] : which is really giving t hem som e im prov em ent .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : I m ean t hey just do t he sam e t hing again once m ore .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] So , t here ’s som et hing t hat is good
about doing it [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ df] : I m ean , t o cleaning it up once m ore .
m n007 [ s^ aa|s^ am ] : Yeah , it m ight be .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n052 [ s.%−] : so we can [ disfm arker]

m n007 [ s] : So m ay be in m y im plem ent at ion I should also t ry t o inspire
m e from t his kind of t hing
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ %−] : That ’s what
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Well , t he ot her t hing would be t o com bine what you ’re
doing .
m e013 [ s^ df] : I m ean m aybe one or [ disfm arker] one or t he ot her of
t he t hings t hat y ou ’re doing would benefit from t he ot her happening
first .
m n052 [ s.%−] : That ’s wh
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ fg] : So ,
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g] : Right ,
m e013 [ s] : so he ’s doing a signal subspace t hing ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : m ay be it would work bet t er if you ’d already done som e
sim ple spect ral subt ract ion ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : or m aybe vi m aybe t he ot her way around ,
m n007 [ b] : Yeah ,
m n007 [ b] : m m − hm m .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : you know ?
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s^ t c] : So I ’ve been t hinking about com bining t he Wiener

m n052 [ s^ df] : I m ean just t o see all [ disfm arker] som e [ disfm arker]
som e such perm ut at ion com binat ion t o see whet her it really helps or
not .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : How is it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I guess I ’m ignorant about t his ,
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : how does [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw] : I m ean , since Wiener filt er also assum es t hat you ’re
[ disfm arker] t hat you ’re adding t oget her t he t wo signals , how is
[ disfm arker] how is t hat differ from signal subspace ?
m n052 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : The signal subspace ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ %−−] : The [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : The signal subspace approach has act ually an in − built
Wiener filt ering in it .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n052 [ fh] : Yeah .

m n052 [ s] : It is like a KL t ransform followed by a Wiener filt er .
m n052 [ s] : Is t he signal is [ disfm arker] is a signal subst rat e .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , oh , OK
m e013 [ s] : so t he difference is t he KL .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : So , t he [ disfm arker] t he different [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : t he c t he [ disfm arker] t he advant age of com bining t wo
t hings is m ainly com ing from t he signal subspace approach doesn’t
work v ery well if t he SNR is very bad .
m n052 [ %−−] : It ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n052 [ s] : it works very poorly wit h t he poor SNR condit ions , and in
colored noise .
m e013 [ s.%−] : So essent ially you could do sim ple spect ral subt ract ion
, followed by a KL t ransform , followed by a
m n052 [ s^ 2] : Wiener filt ering .
m e013 [ s^ e^ m ^ na] : Wiener filt er .
m n052 [ s.%−] : It ’s a [ disfm arker] it ’s a cascade of t wo s
m e013 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : Yeah , in general , y ou don’t [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa] : t hat ’s right
m e013 [ s] : y ou don’t wanna ot horg ort hogonalize if t he t hings are
noisy .
m e013 [ s^ e] : Act ually .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um , t hat was som et hing t hat uh , Herve and I were
t alking about wit h um , t he m ult i − band st uff ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : t hat if you ’re convert ing t hings t o from uh , bands ,
groups of bands int o cepst ral coef y ou know , local sort of local

m n052 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e013 [ fh] : so .
m n052 [ fh] : So .
m n052 [ s] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s one reason m aybe we could
com bine
m n052 [ s^ cs^ df] : s som e [ disfm arker] som et hing t o im prove SNR a
lit t le bit , first st age ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ cs] : and t hen do a som et hing in t he second st age
m n052 [ s^ e] : which could t ake it furt her .
m n007 [ qw^ br^ rt ] : What was your point about [ disfm arker] about
colored noise t here ?
m n052 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : Oh , t he colored noise
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]

m n052 [ s] : t he colored noise [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he v t he
signal subspace approach has [ disfm arker] I m ean , it [ disfm arker] it
act ually depends on invert ing t he m at rices .
m n052 [ %−−] : So it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] ac
m n052 [ s] : t he cov ariance m at rix of t he noise .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : So if [ disfm arker] if it is not posit ive definit e ,
m n052 [ s.%−−] : I m ean it has a [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : It doesn’t behave very well if it is not posit ive definit e
m n052 [ %] : ak
m n052 [ s] : It works v ery well wit h whit e noise because we know for

m e013 [ s^ cs] : So y ou should do spect ral subt ract ion and t hen add
noise .
m n052 [ s] : So t he way t hey get around is like t hey do an inverse
filt ering ,
m n052 [ s] : first of t he colo colored noise
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : and t hen m ake t he noise whit e ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : and t hen finally when you reconst ruct t he speech back ,
y ou do t his filt ering again .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , right .
m e013 [ s] : I was only half kidding .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean if you [ disfm arker] sort of [ vocalsound] you do
t he s spect ral subt ract ion , t hat also get s rid [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : and t hen you [ disfm arker] t hen [ disfm arker] t hen add a

m e013 [ s] : I m ean , t hat sort of what J [ disfm arker] JRASTA does , in a

m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Huh ?
m n052 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s^ e] : in order t o get rid of t he effect s of noise .

m n007 [ s^ cs] : well we find som e people so t hat [ vocalsound] uh ,
agree t o m aybe work wit h us ,
m n007 [ s] : and t hey have im plem ent at ion of VTS t echniques
m n007 [ s] : so it ’s um , Vect or Taylor Series t hat are used t o m m m ,
[ v ocalsound] uh f t o m odel t he t ransform at ion bet ween clean cepst ra
and noisy cepst ra .
m n007 [ fh] : So . Well ,
m n007 [ s] : if y ou t ake t he st andard m odel of channel plus noise , uh ,
it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s a nonlinear eh uh , t ransform at ion in t he cepst ral
dom ain .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m n007 [ fh] : And
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : uh , t here is a way t o approxim at e t his using uh , first −
order or second − order Taylor Series
m n007 [ fh] : and
m n007 [ s] : it can be used for [ vocalsound] uh , get t ing rid of t he
noise and t he channel effect .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : Who is doing t his ?
m n007 [ qy^ bu^ d] : Uh w working in t he cepst ral dom ain ?
m n007 [ s] : So t here is one guy in Grenada ,
fn002 [ s^ bk|s^ 2] : Yeah , in Grenada
m n007 [ s] : and anot her in [ pause] uh , Lucent t hat I m et at ICASSP .
fn002 [ s] : one of m y friend .
m n007 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ qw] : Who ’s t he guy in Grenada ?
fn002 [ h|s] : Uh , Jose Carlos Segura .
m e013 [ s] : I don’t know him .
m n052 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : This VTS has been proposed by CMU ?
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .

fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah , OK .
fn002 [ s^ na] : Originally t he idea was from CMU .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : From C .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ s] : Well , it ’s again a different t hing [ vocalsound]
[ v ocalsound] t hat could be t ried .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m , yeah .

m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah , so at any rat e , you ’re looking general , uh ,
st anding back from it , looking at way s t o com bine one form or anot her

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s^ ba] : uh , looks like a wort hy t hing t o [ disfm arker] t o do
here .
m n007 [ b] : Uh , y eah .
m n007 [ fg] : But , y eah .
m n007 [ s] : But for sure t here ’s required t o [ disfm arker] t hat requires
t o re − check everyt hing else , and re − opt im ize t he ot her t hings
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh y eah .
m n007 [ fh] : and ,
m n007 [ s] : for sure t he on − line norm alizat ion m ay be t he LDA filt er .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Well one of t he [ disfm arker] seem s like one of t he
t hings t o go t hrough next week when Hari ’s here ,
m n007 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ df] : cuz Hari ’ll hav e his own ideas t oo [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : or [ pause] I guess not next week ,
m e013 [ s^ bsc] : week and a half ,

m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ fh] : You know .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So , I m ean one way would [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : he Here are som e alt ernat e visions .
m e013 [ s^ e] : I m ean one would be , y ou look at a few t hings very

m e013 [ s^ e] : you pick on som et hing t hat looks like it ’s prom ising
m e013 [ s^ e] : and t hen everybody works really hard on t he sam e
[ disfm arker] different aspect s of t he sam e t hing .
m e013 [ s^ e] : Anot her t hing would be t o have t t o [ disfm arker] t o pick
t wo pol t wo plausible t hings ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : and [ disfm arker] and you know , have t sort of t wo
working t hings for a while unt il we figure out what ’s bet t er ,

m e013 [ fh] : you know ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,

fn002 [ s] : I do t he difference [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ b] : OK .
fn002 [ s] : I found a difference at t he variance of t his different
m n052 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fn002 [ s^ df] : because , suppose we [ disfm arker] we t hink t hat if t he

m n052 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fn002 [ s^ e] : But Doesn’t help .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I really wonder t hough .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean we ’ve had t hese discussions before ,
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and one of t he t hings t hat st ruck m e was
t hat [ disfm arker] uh , about t his line of t hought t hat was part icularly
int erest ing t o m e was t hat we um [ disfm arker] whenever you condense
t hings , uh , in an irreversible way , um , you t hrow away som e

m e013 [ s] : And , t hat ’s m ost ly viewed on as a good t hing , in t he way
we use it ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : because we wanna suppress t hings t hat will cause
v ariabilit y for uh part icular , uh , phonet ic unit s .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s] : but , you ’ll do t hrow som et hing away .
m e013 [ s:qy ] : And so t he quest ion is , uh , can we figure out if t here ’s
som et hing we ’ve t hrown away t hat we shouldn’t have .
m e013 [ fh] : And um .
m e013 [ fh] : So ,
m e013 [ s:s^ bk] : when t hey were looking at t he difference bet ween
t he filt er bank and t he FFT t hat was going int o t he filt er bank , I was
t hinking " oh , OK ,
m e013 [ s:s] : so t hey ’re picking on som et hing
m e013 [ s:s] : t hey ’re looking on it t o figure out noise , or voice
[ disfm arker] voiced propert y what ever . "
m e013 [ s^ ba] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s int erest ing .
m e013 [ s] : May be t hat helps t o drive t he [ disfm arker] t he t hought
process of com ing up wit h t he feat ures .
m e013 [ s:qy ] : But for m e sort of t he int erest ing t hing was , " well , but
is t here just som et hing in t hat difference which is useful ? "
m e013 [ s^ cs] : So anot her way of doing it , m aybe , would be just t o
t ake t he FFT uh , power spect rum , and feed it int o a neural net work ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and t hen use it , you know , in com binat ion , or alone ,
or [ disfm arker] or what ever

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ bk|s^ ng] : Yeah , but t here is so m uch variabilit y in t he

m e013 [ s] : and a couple post ers away it was som ebody who
com pared one t o uh , just put t ing in t he FFT
m e013 [ s] : and t he FFT did slight ly bet t er .

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So I m ean t he [ disfm arker] i i It ’s t rue t here ’s lot s of
v ariabilit y ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : but again we have t hese wonderful st at ist ical
m echanism s for quant ifying t hat a t hat v ariabilit y , and you know ,
doing som et hing reasonable wit h it .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So ,
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ s] : It − it ’s sam e , you know , argum ent t hat ’s gone bot h ways
about uh , you know , we have t hese dat a driven filt ers , in LDA ,
m e013 [ s] : and on t he ot her hand , if it ’s dat a driven it m eans it ’s
driv en by t hings t hat have lot s of variabilit y , and t hat are necessarily
[ disfm arker] not necessarily gonna be t he sam e in t raining and t est ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : so , in som e ways it ’s good t o have dat a driven t hings ,
m e013 [ s] : and in som e ways it ’s bad t o have dat a driven t hings .
m e013 [ fh] : So ,
m n052 [ fg] : Yeah , d
m e013 [ s] : part of what we ’re discovering , is ways t o com bine t hings
t hat are dat a driv en t han are not .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , so anyway , it ’s just a t hought , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
if we [ disfm arker] if we had t hat [ disfm arker] m aybe it ’s just a baseline
m e013 [ s^ e] : uh , which would show us " well , what are we really
get t ing out of t he filt ers " ,
m e013 [ %−−] : or m aybe i i
m e013 [ s^ e] : probably not by it self ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : but in com binat ion ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : uh ,
m e013 [ s] : you know , m aybe t here ’s som et hing t o be gained from it ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and let t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : But , you know , y y ou ’ve only worked wit h us for a short
t im e ,
m e013 [ s] : m aybe in a year or t wo you w you will act ually com e up wit h
t he right set of t hings t o ext ract from t his inform at ion .
m e013 [ s] : But , m aybe t he neural net and t he H M Ms could figure it
out quicker t han y ou .
fn002 [ s^ am ] : Maybe .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s^ df] : It ’s just a t hought .
fn002 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
fn002 [ s^ cc] : I can [ disfm arker] I will t ry t o do t hat .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .

m n052 [ s] : What [ disfm arker] one [ disfm arker] one um p one t hing is
like what [ disfm arker] before we st art ed using t his VAD in t his Aurora ,
t he [ disfm arker] t h what we did was like , I [ disfm arker] I guess m ost of
y ou know about t his , adding t his addit ional speech − silence bit t o t he
cepst rum and t raining t he HMM on t hat .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : That is just a binary feat ure
m n052 [ s] : and t hat seem s t o be [ v ocalsound] im proving a lot on t he
SpeechDat − Car where t here is a lot of noise
m n052 [ s] : but not m uch on t he TI − digit s .
m n052 [ s] : So , a adding an addit ional feat ure t o dist in t o discrim inat e
bet ween speech and nonspeech was helping .
m n052 [ s] : That ’s it .
m n007 [ qw^ br^ rt ] : Wait [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I ’m sorry ?
m n052 [ s] : Yeah , we act ually added an addit ional binary feat ure t o
t he cepst rum ,
m n052 [ s^ e] : just t he baseline .
m n007 [ qy ^ bh] : Yeah ?
fn002 [ s] : You did som e experim ent .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n052 [ s^ aa^ r] : y eah .
m n052 [ s] : Well , in [ disfm arker] in t he case of TI − digit s it didn’t
act ually give us any t hing ,
m n052 [ s^ df] : because t here wasn’t any f anyt hing t o discrim inat e
bet ween speech ,
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ df] : and it was very short .
m n007 [ b] : Hm m .
m n052 [ s] : But It alian was like very [ disfm arker] it was a huge
im provem ent on It alian .
m n007 [ fg] : Well [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : But any way t he quest ion is even m ore , is wit hin speech ,
can we get som e feat ures ?
m n007 [ qy ] : Are we drop dropping inform at ion t hat can m ight be
useful wit hin speech ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : I m ean . To [ disfm arker] m aybe t o dist inguish bet ween
v oice sound and unvoiced sounds ?
m n052 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n052 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah , yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : And it ’s part icularly m ore relevant now since we ’re gonna

m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ fh] : So .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m n052 [ b] : Mm m .
m n052 [ s] : There was a paper in ICASSP [ disfm arker] t his ICASSP
[ disfm arker] over t he uh ext ract ing som e higher − order uh ,
inform at ion from t he cepst ral coefficient s
m n052 [ s] : and I forgot t he nam e .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : Som e is som e harm onics
m n052 [ s^ no] : I don’t know ,
m n052 [ s] : I can [ disfm arker] I can pull t hat paper out from ICASSP .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy^ bu] : Talking cum ulant s or som et hing ?
m n052 [ %−] : It [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ qy ^ br] : Huh ?
m e013 [ s^ r] : Cum ulant s or som et hing .
m n052 [ h|s^ no] : Uh , I don’t know .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : But [ disfm arker] No .
m n052 [ s^ no] : I don’t rem em ber .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : It wa it was t aking t he , um [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s.%−−] : It was about finding t he higher − order m om ent s of
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n052 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : cum ulant s ,
m n052 [ s^ no.%−−] : And I ’m not sure about whet her it is t he higher −
order m om ent s , or [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : yeah .
m n052 [ s^ am ] : m aybe higher − order cum ulant s
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n052 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : Or m e
m n052 [ %−−] : It was [ disfm arker] it was [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : I m ean , he was showing up uh som e [ disfm arker]
som et hing on noisy speech ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ e] : som e im provem ent on t he noisy speech .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s^ e] : Som e sm all vocabulary t asks .
m e013 [ b] : Uh .
m n052 [ s] : So it was on PLP deriv ed cepst ral coefficient s .

m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah , but again [ disfm arker] You could argue t hat t h
t hat ’s ex act ly what t he neural net work does .
m n052 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s.%−] : So n neural net work uh , is in som e sense equivalent t o
com put ing , y ou know , higher − order m om ent s of what you
[ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ 2.%−−] : t rying t o f
m n052 [ %−−] : t o
m n052 [ s^ 2] : Mom ent s ,
m n052 [ b] : yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , it doesn’t do it very specifically ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ %−−] : and
m e013 [ s^ e] : pret t y [ disfm arker] you know .
m e013 [ fh] : But .
m n052 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ fg] : Uh ,
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ^ t c] : anyt hing on y our end you want t o t alk about ?
m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m e006 [ h|s^ nd] : Um , not hing I wanna really t alk about .
m e006 [ s^ cs] : I can [ disfm arker] I can just uh , um , share a lit t le bit
[ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s^ df] : Sunil hasn’t [ disfm arker] hasn’t heard about uh , what I
’v e been doing .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e006 [ fh] : Um ,
m e006 [ fh] : so ,
m e006 [ fh|s] : um , I t old you I was [ disfm arker] I was [ disfm arker] I was
get t ing prepared t o t ake t his qualifier exam .
m e006 [ s^ df] : So basically t hat ’s just , um , t rying t o propose um , uh
, your nex t your [ disfm arker] your following years of [ disfm arker] of your
PHD work ,
m e006 [ s^ df] : t rying [ disfm arker] t rying t o find a project t o
[ disfm arker] t o define and [ disfm arker] and t o work on .
m e006 [ s] : So , I ’ve been , uh , looking int o , um , doing som et hing
about r uh , speech recognit ion using acoust ic event s .
m e006 [ fh] : So ,
m e006 [ s] : um , t he idea is you have all t hese [ disfm arker] t hese
different ev ent s ,
m e006 [ s^ e] : for ex am ple voicing ,
m e006 [ s^ e] : nasalit y ,
m e006 [ s^ e] : R − coloring ,
m e006 [ s^ e] : y ou know burst

m e006 [ s^ e] : or noise , uh , fricat ion ,
m e006 [ s^ e] : t hat kinda st uff ,
m e006 [ s] : um , building robust um , prim ary det ect ors for t hese
acoust ic event s ,
m e006 [ s] : and using t he out put s of t hese robust det ect ors t o do
speech recognit ion .
m e006 [ fh] : Um ,
m e006 [ fh|s] : and , um , t hese [ disfm arker] t hese prim ary det ect ors ,
um , will be , uh , inspired by , you know , m ult i − band t echniques , um ,
doing t hings , um , sim ilar t o Larry Saul ’s work on , uh , graphical
m odels t o [ disfm arker] t o det ect t hese [ disfm arker] t hese , uh ,
acoust ic event s .
m e006 [ fh|s] : And , um , so I [ disfm arker] I been [ disfm arker] I been
t hinking about t hat
m e006 [ s] : and som e of t he issues t hat I ’ve been running int o are ,
um , ex act ly what [ disfm arker] what kind of acoust ic event s I need ,
m e006 [ s] : what [ disfm arker] um , what acoust ic ev ent s will prov ide a
[ disfm arker] a good enough coverage t o [ disfm arker] in order t o do
t he lat er recognit ion st eps .
m e006 [ s] : And , also , um , once I decide a set of acoust ic event s ,
um , h how do I [ disfm arker] how do I get labels ?
m e006 [ s^ e] : Training dat a for [ disfm arker] for t hese acoust ic event s
.
m e006 [ s] : And , t hen lat er on down t he line , I can st art playing wit h
t he [ disfm arker] t he m odels t hem selves ,
m e006 [ s^ e] : t he [ disfm arker] t he prim ary det ect ors .
m e006 [ fh] : Um ,
m e006 [ fh] : so ,
m e006 [ fh|s] : um , I kinda see [ disfm arker] like , aft er [ disfm arker]
aft er building t he prim ary det ect ors I see um , m yself t aking t he
out put s and feeding t hem in , sort a t andem st yle int o [ disfm arker] int o
a um , Gaussian m ix t ures HMM back − end , um , and doing recognit ion
.
m e006 [ fh] : Um .
m e006 [ fh|s] : So , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s just generally what I ’ve
been looking at .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e006 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s] : By [ disfm arker] by t he way , uh , t he voiced − unvoiced
v ersion of t hat for inst ance could t ie right in t o what Carm en was
looking at .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : So ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : y ou know , um , if you [ disfm arker] if a m ult i − band
approach was helpful as [ disfm arker] as I t hink it is ,

m e013 [ s] : it seem s t o be helpful for det erm ining voiced − unvoiced ,
m e006 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : t hat one m ight be anot her t hing .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ b] : Yeah .
m e006 [ fg] : Um ,
m e006 [ qy ^ rt ] : were [ disfm arker] were you gonna say som et hing ?
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e006 [ s.%−−] : It looked [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m e006 [ s] : never m ind .
m e006 [ fh] : Um , yeah .
m e006 [ s] : And so , t his [ disfm arker] t his past week um , I ’ve been uh
, looking a lit t le bit int o uh , TRAPS um , and doing [ disfm arker] doing
TRAPS on [ disfm arker] on t hese e event s t oo ,
m e006 [ s] : just , um , seeing [ disfm arker] seeing if t hat ’s possible .
m e006 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e006 [ fh] : and
m e006 [ fh|s] : um , ot her t han t hat , uh , I was kicked out of I − house
for liv ing t here for four years .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Oh no .
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d^ j] : So you liv e in a cardboard box in t he st reet now
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qrr] : or , no ?
m e006 [ h|s^ aap] : Uh , well , s s som som et hing like t hat .

m e013 [ s^ j] : So a t wo bedroom cardboard box .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Th − t hat ’s great .

m e006 [ b] : yeah
m n052 [ b.%] : Yeah . Yeah . [ vocalsound] Yeah .

m n052 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : Um ,
m n052 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy ^ t c.%−−] : Do y wanna say anyt hing about [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : You [ disfm arker] you act ually been [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , last week you were doing t his st uff wit h Pierre , you
were [ disfm arker] y ou were m ent ioning .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t hat [ disfm arker] t hat som et hing wort h t alking
about ,
m e013 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e026 [ h] : Um ,
m e026 [ %−−] : it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s^ ng] : Well , um , it [ disfm arker] I don’t t hink it direct ly relat es
.
m e026 [ fh|s] : Um , well , so , I was helping a speech researcher
nam ed Pierre Divenyi
m e026 [ s] : and he ’s int He want ed t o um , look at um , how people
respond t o form ant changes , I t hink .
m e026 [ fh] : Um .
m e026 [ s] : So he [ disfm arker] he creat ed a lot of synt het ic audio files
of v owel − t o − vowel t ransit ions ,
m e026 [ s] : and t hen he want ed a psycho − acoust ic um , spect rum .
m e026 [ s] : And he want ed t o look at um , how t he energy is m oving
[ pause] over t im e in t hat spect rum
m e026 [ s] : and com pare t hat t o t he [ disfm arker] t o t he list ener t est s
.
m e026 [ fh] : And , um .
m e026 [ s] : So , I gav e him a PLP spect rum .
m e026 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] t o um [ disfm arker] he [ disfm arker] he t
want ed t o t rack t he peaks so he could look at how t hey ’re m oving .
m e026 [ s] : So I t ook t he um , PLP LPC coefficient s and um , I found t he
root s .
m e026 [ s^ e] : This was som et hing t hat St ephane suggest ed .
m e026 [ s] : I found t he root s of t he um , LPC polynom ial t o , um , t rack
t he peaks in t he , um , PLP LPC spect ra .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : well t here is aligned spect ral pairs , is like t he
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ qy.%−] : Is t hat t he aligned s
m e013 [ s] : It ’s a r root LPC , uh , of som e sort .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Oh , no .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s^ bu.%−−] : So you just [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .

m n052 [ s^ bu] : inst ead of t he log you t ook t he root square , I m ean
cubic root or som et hing .
m n052 [ s] : What di w I didn’t get t hat .
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No , no .
m e013 [ s^ nd] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s t aking t he
[ disfm arker] finding t he root s of t he LPC polynom ial .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Polynom ial .
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n052 [ qy .%−−] : Is t hat t he line spect ral [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ na] : So it ’s like line spect ral pairs .
m n052 [ s^ bk.%−] : Oh , it ’s like line sp
m e013 [ s^ bu^ df] : Except I t hink what t hey call line spect ral pairs t hey
push it t owards t he unit circle ,
m e013 [ qy^ g] : don’t t hey ,
m e013 [ s^ e.%−−] : t o sort of ?
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : But it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : But uh , you know .
m e013 [ s] : But what we ’d used t o do w when I did synt hesis at
Nat ional Sem iconduct or t went y years ago , t he t echnique we were
play ing wit h init ially was [ disfm arker] was t aking t he LPC polynom ial and
[ disfm arker] and uh , finding t he root s .
m e013 [ s^ e] : It wasn’t PLP cuz Hynek hadn’t invent ed it yet ,
m e013 [ s] : but it was just LPC ,
m e013 [ s] : and uh , we found t he root s of t he polynom ial ,
m e013 [ s] : And t h When you do t hat , som et im es t hey ’re f t hey ’re
what m ost people call form ant s ,
m e013 [ s] : som et im es t hey ’re not .
m n052 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s a lit t le ,
m n007 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s] : uh [ disfm arker] Form ant t racking wit h it can be a lit t le
t ricky
m e013 [ s^ df] : cuz y ou get t hese funny [ v ocalsound] values in
[ disfm arker] in real speech ,
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : So you just [ disfm arker] You t ypically just get a few
root s ?
m e013 [ %−] : but .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : You know ,
m e018 [ s^ e] : t wo or t hree ,
m e018 [ s^ e] : som et hing like t hat ?
m e013 [ s] : Well y ou get t hese com plex pairs .
m e013 [ s^ df] : And it depends on t he order t hat you ’re doing ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e026 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ fh] : but .

m e026 [ fg] : So , um ,
m e026 [ s.%−−] : if [ disfm arker] @ @ [ com m ent ] Every root t hat ’s
[ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s] : Since it ’s a real signal , t he LPC polynom ial ’s gonna have
real coefficient s .
m e026 [ s] : So I t hink t hat m eans t hat every root t hat is not a real root
[ com m ent ] is gonna be a c com plex pair ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e026 [ s^ e] : um , of a com plex v alue and it s conjugat e .
m e026 [ fh] : Um .
m e026 [ s.%−−] : So for each [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s] : And if you look at t hat on t he unit circle , um , one of t hese
[ disfm arker] one of t he m em bers of t he pair will be a posit ive
frequency , one will be a negat ive frequency , I t hink .
m e026 [ s.%−−] : So I just [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ fh] : So , um ,
m e026 [ s] : f for t he [ disfm arker] I ’m using an eight h − order
poly nom ial
m e026 [ s] : and I ’ll get t hree or four of t hese pairs
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e026 [ s^ e] : which give m e s which giv es m e t hree or four peak
posit ions .
m n052 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : This is from synt het ic speech ,
m e013 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e026 [ s^ aa] : It ’s [ disfm arker] Right .
m e026 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So if it ’s from synt het ic speech t hen m aybe it ’ll be cleaner
.
m e013 [ s] : I m ean for real speech in real [ disfm arker] t hen what you
end up having is , like I say , funny lit t le t hings t hat are [ disfm arker]
don’t exact ly fit y our not ion of form ant s all t hat well .
m e018 [ qw.%−] : How did [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fg] : But
m e013 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but m ost ly t hey are .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Most ly t hey do .
m e026 [ b] : Mm m ,
m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and what [ disfm arker] I m ean in
[ disfm arker] in what we were doing , which was not so m uch looking at
t hings , it was OK
m n007 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ df] : because it was just a quest ion of quant izat ion .
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : Uh , we were just you know , st oring [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s] : It was [ disfm arker] We were doing , uh , st ored speech , uh
, quant izat ion .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But [ disfm arker] but uh , in your case
m e013 [ fh] : um , y ou know [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Act ually you have peaks t hat are not at t he form ant ’s
posit ions ,
m n007 [ s] : but t hey are lower in energy
m e026 [ s^ na] : But [ disfm arker] t here ’s som e of t hat ,
m e026 [ s^ aa] : y es .
m n007 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] Well t hey are m uch lower .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : If t his is synt het ic speech can’t you just get t he
form ant s direct ly ?
m e018 [ qw] : I m ean h how is t he speech creat ed ?
m e026 [ s] : It was creat ed from a synt hesizer ,
m e026 [ fh] : and um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu|qy^ g^ rt ] : Wasn’t a form ant synt hesizer was it ?
m e013 [ s^ am ] : I bet it [ disfm arker] it m ight have [ disfm arker] m ay
have been
m e026 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker] d d t his [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ df] : but m aybe he didn’t have cont rol over it or
som et hing ?
m e026 [ s] : In [ disfm arker] in fact w we [ disfm arker] we could get , um ,
form ant frequencies out of t he synt hesizer , as well .
m e026 [ fh] : And , um ,
m e026 [ s] : w one t hing t hat t he , um , LPC approach will hopefully give
m e in addit ion , um , is t hat I [ disfm arker] I m ight be able t o find t he b
t he bandwidt hs of t hese hum ps as well .
m e026 [ s] : Um , St ephane suggest ed looking at each com plex pair as
a [ disfm arker] like a se second − order IIR filt er .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e026 [ fh] : Um ,
m e026 [ s] : but I don’t t hink t here ’s a g a really good reason not t o
um , get t he form ant frequencies from t he synt hesizer inst ead .
m e026 [ s^ e] : Ex cept t hat you don’t have t he psycho − acoust ic
m odeling in t hat .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : so t he act ual [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So you ’re not get t ing t he act ual form ant s per se .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : You ’re get t ing t he [ disfm arker] Again , you ’re get t ing
sort of t he ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b.x] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : You ’re get t ing som et hing t hat is [ disfm arker] is uh , af
st rongly affect ed by t he PLP m odel .
m e013 [ s] : And so it ’s m ore psycho − acoust ic .

m e013 [ s] : So it ’s a lit t le [ disfm arker] It ’s [ disfm arker] It ’s
[ disfm arker] It ’s sort of [ disfm arker] sort of a different t hing .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e018 [ s] : That ’s sort of t he point .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : But [ disfm arker] Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : i Ordinarily , in a form ant synt hesizer , t he bandwidt hs
as well as t he ban uh , form ant cent ers are [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , t hat ’s [ disfm arker] Som ewhere in t he synt hesizer
t hat was put in ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : as [ disfm arker] as what you [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : But [ disfm arker] but yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : y ou v iew each com plex pair as essent ially a second − order
sect ion ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : which has , uh , band cent er and band widt h ,
m e013 [ fh] : and um ,
m e013 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : But .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : O K .
m e013 [ fh] : So , uh ,
m e013 [ s^ t c] : yeah , you ’re going back t oday
m e013 [ s] : and t hen back in a week I guess ,
m e013 [ %−−] : and .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Great !
m e013 [ s] : Well , welcom e .
m n052 [ s^ ft ] : Thanks .
m e018 [ qy ^ cs^ d^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : I guess we should do digit s quickly .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh y eah , digit s .
m e013 [ s] : I alm ost forgot t hat .
fn002 [ s] : Digit s .
m e013 [ s] : I alm ost forgot our daily digit s .
m e018 [ qy ^ cs.%] : You wanna go ahead ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m e018 [ z] : OK .
