m n082 [ s^ rt ] : He is , uh , assist ant professor at UPC .
m n082 [ s] : And m ay be Jordi , y ou have a few words [ pause]
concerning y our work [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ e] : one or t wo sent ence
m n082 [ s^ df] : and [ pause] because we will have t om orrow a t alk from
him in m ore det ail concerning what ’s going on .
m n040 [ qy ^ bu^ d.%−−] : Eh , you [ disfm arker] you want m e t o [ pause]

m n082 [ s^ aa|s^ df^ na] : Yeah , only a short int roduct ion ,
m n040 [ s^ bk] : Oh !
m n082 [ s^ cs^ e] : ve very short int roduct ion , please .
m n040 [ s^ bk] : Of course .

m n082 [ s^ fa|s] : Uh , sorry , one int errupt ion .
m n082 [ s] : This is not relat ed t o hearing ,
m n082 [ s] : it ’s only for [ pause] fixing it .
m n082 [ s] : It ’s not a earphone .
m n040 [ s.%−−] : Ah , it ’s not a hear [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ aa] : No .
m n082 [ fh] : So .
m n040 [ s^ bu] : It works [ pause] like [ disfm arker] like t his .
m n082 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
m n082 [ s] : Like t his one .
m n082 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n040 [ s^ bk] : Ah ,
m n082 [ s] : It ’s only a m icrophone .
m n040 [ %−] : t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m n040 [ s^ bk] : Ah ,
m n082 [ b] : Yeah ?
m n040 [ s] : t hat ’s uh [ pause] m uch m ore com fort able .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m n040 [ fh] : and eh ,
m n040 [ fh] : eh
m n040 [ fh|s] : well , t he research t opics at t his m om ent is uh , [ pause]
I P − eight y t raffic m onit oring and charact erizat ion and em [ pause] eh
[ pause] t ool [ disfm arker] developing t ools uh for qualit y of service , eh

m n040 [ fh|s^ e] : eh [ pause] in t his area .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ s^ ft ] : Thank you .
m n082 [ s^ cc^ rt ] : And aft er t he t alk of [ pause] uh , Miguel , I [ pause]
will [ pause] giv e [ pause] you [ pause] all [ pause] a few slides
concerning t he project proposal .
m n082 [ s^ cc] : I will um [ pause] say som et hing about in which

m n082 [ fh] : and
m n082 [ fh] : uh
m n082 [ s^ am ] : Maybe it was m y fault t hat I assum ed t hat t he point er
of [ pause] Miguel [ pause] concerning UMTS services was [ pause]
deploy ed t o everybody ,
m n082 [ s] : but it was only sent t o m e ,
m n082 [ s] : so in t he m eant im e everybody got , I believe , t his point er
from m e ,
m n082 [ fh] : and
m n082 [ s] : m ay be we [ disfm arker] It ’s a hom ework , in principle , for
t he nex t m eet ing , t o get [ vocalsound] [ pause] a lit t le bit fam iliar wit h
t hese t hings .
m n035 [ s] : Worse t han no work .
m n082 [ fh] : And [ pause] um
m n082 [ s^ t ] : so I believe we will not hav e [ pause] t oday a very hard
t echnical discussion ,
m n082 [ s^ t ] : m aybe m ore a few t opic and it em s we will focus in t he
next days , unt il t he next m eet ing .
m n082 [ s] : And when we are ready wit h our m eet ing .
m n082 [ s] : Everyt hing is done .
m n082 [ s^ t ] : Then , uh , we have t o read t hese num ber
m n082 [ s^ df^ t ] : and we go around here , every m em ber .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ fh] : So .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ s^ co^ t ^ t c] : Miguel , please .
m n021 [ s^ ft ] : Thank you .

m n021 [ s] : Well , eh , I [ disfm arker] I hav e [ pause] prepared , eh , a
really short t alk about som e of t he t opics
m n021 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I have been doing som e w som e research
work [ pause] uh before com ing here .
m n021 [ fh|s^ cc] : And eh , well , m ainly I will present
m n021 [ s] : uh [ disfm arker] [ pause] Here you have m ore or less t he
sket ch of t he present at ion .
m n021 [ s^ cc^ rt ] : I will present som e ideas and som e concept s about
[ pause] what ad − hoc net works are ,
m n021 [ s] : about t he issues in m edia access cont rol in wireless
net works ,
m n021 [ s] : also about rout ing in such kind of net works
m n021 [ fh|s^ cc] : and , eh , I will m ake som e com m ent s also about
[ pause] uh [ pause] t he current st andards of wireless local area
net works
m n021 [ s^ cc] : and finally , I will present t he blueprint of [ disfm arker]
of m y research project or m y research uh proposal here .
m n021 [ fh|s] : So [ pause] t he first t hing is eh what an ad − hoc net work
is .
m n021 [ s^ df] : You know , uh , an ad − hoc net work is m ade of wireless
nodes .
m n021 [ s^ df] : These nodes of course can [ pause] be m obile nodes ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : and , eh in t his net work t here is no [ pause] net work
[ pause] infrast ruct ure .
m n021 [ fh|s] : So [ pause] eh [ pause] t he only [ pause] act ive t hing we
have is t he m obile nodes .
m n021 [ fh] : And eh
m n021 [ s] : end − t o − end com m unicat ion , is som et im es , uh [ pause]
[ v ocalsound] done by direct com m unicat ion from one node t o t he
ot her ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : because [ pause] t hey can t alk t o each ot her .
m n021 [ s] : But som et im es it is not possible , t his direct
com m unicat ion , because nodes , end [ disfm arker] uh source or
[ disfm arker] and dest inat ion nodes are um are t oo far away .
m n021 [ s] : And in t his case , [ pause] it can be done , com m unicat ion
can be done , by uh using m ult i − hub rout ing .
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ s] : an int erm ediat e , or a set of int erm ediat e nodes will
[ pause] rout e or will forward t he packet from t he sender t o t he
dest inat ion .
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ fh|s] : uh [ pause] in a sense , what we have in t his kind of
net works , [ pause] is t hat , uh [ pause] nodes are as bot h arced as
bot h uh [ pause] endpoint s and also rout ers of ot her neighboring
nodes .

m n021 [ s] : And t his m akes a uh difference from [ pause] ot her kind of
net work .
m n021 [ s] : And well , regarding [ pause] t he purposes of [ pause] what
can t his kind of net work be used for , [ v ocalsound] eh [ pause] we can
say t hat , well , cellular net works are infrast ruct ure − based net works ,
m n021 [ s] : in t his kind of ad − hoc net works , we don’t have
[ v ocalsound] any t hing uh , wit h t he except ion of t he net work nodes .
m n021 [ s] : So , t his uh net work can be useful for eh [ vocalsound] uh
[ pause] occasions where no available infrast ruct ure is present ,
m n021 [ s^ e^ rt ] : like for exam ple , in [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] eh
aft er som e kind of [ disfm arker] of [ disfm arker] eh um [ pause]
cat ast rophe cat ast rophic event ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : or , also when [ disfm arker] even when t here is a
net work available , [ pause] we don’t want , for different reasons , t o
use t he av ailable net work .
m n021 [ s^ e] : This lat t lat er case can be , for ex am ple , t he use in
m ilit ary sy st em s ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : where [ pause] m aybe we don’t want t o use t he ot her
[ disfm arker] t he enem y net work infrast ruct ure , for evident reasons .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ qw] : Hm m ?
m n082 [ s] : But you can also , I believe , uh t o have an ad − hoc
net work , where one node is t hen connect ing t o t he out er world .
m n082 [ s^ df] : For inst ance , what I have in m ind , you have a car ,
where y ou plug in different devices and t hey t alk t o each ot her , for
inst ance ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : but one device decided t o go t o t he G S M net work or
GPS net work , or what ever kind of t hings .
m n021 [ s^ na] : That ’s OK .
m n082 [ s] : So t here ’s a cert ain kind of t ask uh , for one node wit hin
t he ad − hoc net work t o provide connect ivit y t o t he out er world ,
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n021 [ s^ na] : That ’s O K .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s^ na] : That ’s perfect , you know .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s] : This [ disfm arker] in t his case , we will say t hat t his node is
act ing as a [ disfm arker] as a gat ext ernal gat eway , from t his net work
[ pause] t o connect t o ot her net works ,
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n021 [ s] : and of course t he underlying [ pause] uh prot ocols can can
be , of course , uh IP − based .
m n021 [ fh] : Uh , OK .
m n021 [ s] : Here you have sev eral [ disfm arker] several uh , proposed ,
uh , scenarios for [ disfm arker] for used t his net works .
m n021 [ s^ e] : When no net work is av ailable ,

m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK ?
m n021 [ s^ e] : And anot her [ disfm arker] anot her applicat ion , for
ex am ple , NASA is [ disfm arker] is uh st udying , is uh t he use of t hese
net works , t hese ad − hoc net works , for sending m ult iple probes , uh ,
um [ pause] uh [ pause] m issions .
m n021 [ s^ e] : So , for exam ple , all of you are aware of t his uh
[ disfm arker] t he last At las , t he last successful uh Mars m ission ,
m n021 [ s] : t he cellular vehicle was only one , and was uh walking
around , uh roam ing around t he base st at ion , which in t his case was
t he gat eway uh node of t his net work ,
m n021 [ s] : but it was only one m obile node , of course .
m n021 [ s] : Not hing prevent s ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : except well m aybe t he cost , t o send not only one
m obile rov er , but t en t ons of t hem , or [ disfm arker] [ pause] or at least
uh sev eral of t hem .
m n021 [ fh] : So , [ pause] uh
m n021 [ s] : higher area could be covered , could be explored
m n021 [ s] : and uh of course , all t he different nodes could also use
som e kind of ad − hoc net working , , ad − hoc rout ing , t o ext end t he
dist ance , t he m axim um dist ance , t han uh a single radio t ransm ission
will [ disfm arker] would allow .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n082 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n021 [ s] : And in t he ot her case , or t he ot her area uh of
[ disfm arker] of [ disfm arker] of applicat ion , [ pause] is t he so − called
net work of sensors ,
m n021 [ s^ e^ rt ] : where [ pause] we can deploy a set of sensors in a
m ay be uninhabit ed area ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : let ’s say , for ex am ple , t he forest ,
m n021 [ s] : and we can uh t ake som e inform at ion
m n021 [ fh|s^ e^ rt ] : uh , for exam ple for [ disfm arker] for fire − fight ing ,
we can just launch from a plane , several sm all sensors ,
m n021 [ fh] : and uh
m n021 [ s^ e] : t hese sensors can be for ex am ple , uh checking t hat
t here is no fire ,
m n021 [ s^ e^ rt ] : t hey can hav e som e kind of uh let ’s say infrared
t echnology sensor ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : so we can cover a huge area wit h only a sm all set of
[ disfm arker] of sensors , and wit hout any ot her infrast ruct ure .
m n021 [ qy ^ d] : Yeah .
m n030 [ h|qy^ rt ] : Um , is t hat really an ad − hoc net work ?
m n030 [ s^ df] : Because t he sensors are not m oving .
m n030 [ s^ ba^ df] : And I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] m akes no sense wit h
m ov ing sensors because t hen you don’t know where t he sensors are .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n030 [ fh] : So .

m n021 [ fh] : Well ,
m n021 [ s^ ba] : You know , it ’s an int erest ing quest ion .
m n021 [ s^ ng] : Uh , t he [ disfm arker] t he m ain t hing about an ad − hoc
net work is not t hat nodes m ov e .
m n021 [ s] : It is t he way of t opology changes can happen .
m n021 [ s^ df] : The idea t hat m m m , any change is possible at any
giv en m om ent .
m n021 [ s:qw] : But y ou can of course ask , " but if t he nodes are not
m ov ing , what kind of t opology changes can we expect ? "
m n030 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n030 [ s^ na] : That ’s it .
m n021 [ fh|s] : Well , eh , t he t hing is t hat usually in [ disfm arker] in a n
in a net work of sensors , what we hav e , or t he idea is t o have um , an
im port ant num ber of sensors , and m aybe wit h a high filer rat e .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ e] : m ay be t he bat t eries are uh [ pause] [ vocalsound]
ex haust ed in som e nodes because m aybe uh t hey are not being able
t o t ake uh , let ’s say , any sun t o recharge it s cells ,
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s^ e] : uh m aybe som e of t hem can be uh just uh out of order
[ pause] for ot her [ pause] eh env ironm ent a environm ent al condit ions .
m n021 [ fh|s^ df] : So uh t he idea is t hat even when t hese nodes are
not m ov ing , t hey can st art and st op working at uh , let ’s say , higher
pace .
m n021 [ s] : Then , uh [ pause] what will happen in a [ disfm arker] in a
regular net work , uh in a net work where you don’t have or [ disfm arker]
eit her m obilit y or uh t his uh on − off uh rat e , high rat e .
m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s^ co] : Let m e go back t o your uh uh exam ple .
m n030 [ b] : Hm m .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s] : Have in m ind som e rout ers are burnt [ pause] here , at ICSI
or what ever kind of t hing ,
m n082 [ qw] : what will happen t hen even in a fixed net work ?
m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ fh|s] : So , if som e sensors are get t ing out of uh [ pause]
serv ice and what ev er kind of t hing , so t he t opology has changed ,
ev en if no node is m oving .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m ,
m n082 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ s] : And how t o provide t he connect ivit y and t he
int ercom m unicat ion t hings wi wit hin t his net work .
m n021 [ s^ ft ] : Thank you , Joe .

m n030 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n030 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ fg] : Well ,
m n021 [ fh|s] : uh , y ou know , and finally , uh , anot her non − m ilit ary
applicat ions , where uh m aybe a net work is available , like for exam ple
, a room like t his ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : where we have , in fa in fact , a wired infrast ruct ure ,
m n021 [ s] : but [ pause] t his uh [ pause] possible applicat ion of ad −
hoc net works could be uh , any place , any m eet ing room , where we
arriv e wit h our com put ers
m n021 [ s] : and eh we just [ pause] can com m unicat e seam lessly
[ pause] t o each ot her wit hout [ pause] any kind [ pause] of access
point , any kind of uh m m m ex t ernal net work ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : because [ pause] t he kind of work we want t o do is just
only local based ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : it ’s only t o chat t o each ot her or t o exchange files wit h
t he person , which is [ pause] in front of us .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n021 [ s] : but we n don’t want t o product [ disfm arker] pro provide ,
eh , access t o t he int ernet or som et hing .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : And , of course , t he sam e eh [ disfm arker] t he sam e
scenario , [ pause] could also happen in a place where t here is no
[ pause] uh , infrast ruct ure available .
m n021 [ s^ e] : Let ’s say a m eet ing room uh , in [ disfm arker] in t he
m iddle of t he desert ,
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ? ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : wit hout any ot her net work .
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ s:s^ bk] : t he point [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker] or t he quest ion
could be for som e of us , t he idea of say ing " OK ,
m n021 [ s:s^ na] : That sounds OK ,
m n021 [ qh^ cs^ rt ] : but why [ pause] not t o use a longer t ransm ission
range , so we can reach any dest inat ion in just one hop ? "
m n021 [ s^ df] : This seem s t o m ake sense because , [ pause] well , uh
we are [ pause] t his way avoiding all t he rout ing problem
m n021 [ s] : t hat , well , we will t alk a lit t le bit uh , about rout ing
[ pause] lat er ,
m n021 [ fh] : but uh
m n021 [ s^ ba] : it [ disfm arker] it seem s t hat i probably t hat t he
problem is [ disfm arker] is not an easy one ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : because uh a node ’s m oving , t he rout e is changing ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : so w one can t hink t hat rout ing in t his uh scenario is
[ disfm arker] is a com plex t hing .

m n021 [ s] : But t he problem is [ pause] if w we just uh [ pause] t ry t o
put m ore power in each t r t ransm it t er ,
m n021 [ s] : so t his uh t ransm it t er can reach any dest inat ion [ pause]
in only one hop ,
m n021 [ s] : what we are doing is uh t o rising t he power needs of each
node ,
m n021 [ s] : and also we are reducing t he net work uh t hroughput ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : because we are only allowing one t ransm issio one
t ransm ission at a t im e .
m n021 [ s^ df] : Because uh , well , we cannot allow several
t ransm issions , several high − powered t ransm issions at t he sam e t im e
m n021 [ s^ df] : because one is int erfering wit h t he ot her .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ %−] : We are [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s] : uh I t hink I ’m not t elling [ pause] it yet ,
m n021 [ s] : but [ pause] we are assum ing [ pause] t hat we are using a
single com m on channel for all t he nodes .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s^ df] : So t hat ’s why [ pause] we cannot allow several
t ransm it t ers in t he sam e channel at t he sam e t im e .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s^ ba] : So , t he idea of hav hav ing a longer t ransm ission
range is not [ pause] a good [ pause] one .
m n021 [ s] : or at least it has t he drawbacks um , um , I was t elling you
.
m n021 [ fh|s] : Eh , let ’s speak a lit t le bit about t he m edia access
issues in [ disfm arker] in wireless net works ,
m n021 [ fh|s] : Uh , you know , t he [ vocalsound] easiest eh way t o
[ disfm arker] t o show how t his works is [ disfm arker] or at least one of
[ disfm arker] I t hink one of t he easiest [ disfm arker] is t hat t his drawing
, or t his pict ure ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : what [ disfm arker] what we have is a set of nodes ,
each one at a different locat ion .
m n021 [ s] : At [ disfm arker] at [ disfm arker] at a [ disfm arker] at an
[ disfm arker] at a given m om ent t his eh node , t his dash node is
[ disfm arker] is t ransm it t ing
m n021 [ s] : and [ pause] uh , t he arrows are represent ing t his
t ransm ission
m n021 [ s] : and t he receiving nodes , t hese t hree nodes , are
receiv ing t he t ransm ission ,
m n021 [ s] : and I ’m t rying t o uh [ pause] show t he area , t he covered
area , for [ disfm arker] of t his t ransm ission by m eans of t his uh dashed
eh line circle .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ fh|s] : So , uh , any t ransm ission [ v ocalsound] has a m axim um
t ransm ission range ,

m n021 [ fh|s] : and uh in t he [ pause] sim pler way , we can see t his like
a circle wit h t he cent er in t he t ransm it t er and a cert ain radius .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : The value of t his radius is uh [ disfm arker] [ pause] in
principle , is a fixed value
m n021 [ s] : and it depends on t he uh power of t he t ransm it t er .
m n021 [ s^ bd] : Of course , uh [ pause] t his is only our uh [ pause]
sim plife sim plified m odel
m n021 [ s^ bd] : and of course t his can be uh [ pause] im proved uh
[ pause] a lot ,
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : And in fact t he real behavior is not exact ly t his one ,
m n021 [ s] : but uh for [ disfm arker] for what I want t o say it ’s
[ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] OK ,
m n021 [ s] : it ’s enough .
m n021 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ?
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ qw] : what are t he differences uh , in t his [ disfm arker] in t his
eh [ pause] wireless t ransm ission , regarding uh t o t he wireless
[ disfm arker] t o t he wired ones .
m n021 [ qw] : What [ disfm arker] what are t he d t he m ain differences .
m n021 [ s] : Well , t he m ain differences com e from t he fact t hat , uh in
uh [ disfm arker] in uh wireless t ransm ission we have a special dom ain
we don’t have when we are using a wire for t ransm it t ing a signal .
m n021 [ s^ df] : And t he point I ’m t ry ing t o show in t his pict ure , is t hat
if for ex am ple , t his ot her node want s also t o t ransm it while t his one
was t ransm it t ing , if we are using som e kind of carry det ect schem e ,
like for ex am ple , CSMA , or som et hing uh uh derivat ed from it , t he
problem is t hat t his node will hear t he g t he m t he t ransm ission m edia
,
m n021 [ s] : it won’t be able t o hear anyt hing
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : so , he will conclude t hat [ pause] no ot her t ransm ission
is going on ,
m n021 [ s] : and he will st art t ransm it t ing .
m n021 [ s] : And if he does , what will happen is t hat t his node and t his
ot her node will also receive t his t ransm ission ,
m n021 [ s] : and t his will produce , at least at t hese t wo nodes , a
collision or a m a m a [ disfm arker] a re a bad recept ion .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : So none of t hese t wo sim ult aneous t ransm issions will be
properly receiv ed at t his node nor at t his ot her node .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n021 [ fh|s.%−−] : eh , t his problem is what is called [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ fa] : Oh , sorry .
m n021 [ fh|%−−] : uh , t he [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : I t hink t his is t he previous one ?

m n021 [ s.%−] : This is t he Germ an [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ fg] : Uh .
m n035 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n035 [ %−] : One
m n082 [ s^ aa] : Yes ,
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n035 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n082 [ s] : t his one .
m n021 [ s^ ft ] : t hank you .
m n021 [ fh] : Eh
m n021 [ s] : t his is what is called a " hidden t erm inal " problem .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s^ df] : because well uh t his node is not able t o hear t his ot her
node [ pause] because of t he dist ance [ pause] uh , bet ween t hem .
m n021 [ s] : But Uh , t his problem , as y ou can see in t he [ disfm arker]
in t he pict ure , is uh really producing [ pause] at least som e recept ion
problem at t hese t wo nodes .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n021 [ s] : so it is [ disfm arker] it is a problem t hat we have t o address
m n021 [ s] : and it is a new problem com pared t o wired uh m edia
access cont rol .
m n021 [ fh] : And , uh ,
m n021 [ s] : well , som e devel som e prot ocols have been developed t o
av oid t his problem and t o t ry t o address t his part icular behavior of
wireless t ransm issions
m n021 [ s] : and t he m ain idea is t o use som e kind of a reservat ion
m echanism .
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ s] : we are um reserving a cert ain , and a specific uh , area of
space so we can [ v ocalsound] guarant ee t hat nobody is t rying t o use
t he sam e space at t he sam e t im e .
m n021 [ fh] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : This is t he basic idea .
m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ fg] : Um
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ?
m n082 [ qy^ cs] : Miguel , can you giv e som e exam ples for such kind of
prot ocols ?
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ aa|s.%−] : Yeah , in fact [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s.%−] : One is really [ disfm arker] really [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s] : This one .
m n021 [ s.%−−] : This one , n next slide is [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah , yeah .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n021 [ s] : in eh t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he m ain idea and
[ disfm arker] and t he base of m ost of t his prot ocols , is what t his
[ disfm arker] t he so − called RTS CTS uh dialogue .
m n021 [ s.%−−] : The idea is t hat ,
m n021 [ fh] : uh ,
m n021 [ s] : of course , t his is only int ended for unicast t ransm issions ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : I m ean , only for when a node want s t o t ransm it
som et hing t o a neighbor node .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : But not t o broadcast . Uh , t o all t he nodes .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s] : For t his [ disfm arker] for t his eh , work , t he t ransm it t er has
t o send a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a reservat ion packet called RTS ,
" Request To Send " , before eh [ pause] being able t o send dat a .
m n021 [ s] : And t he receiver is ex pect ed t o ret urn back anot her
packet [ pause] called CTS , " Clear To Send " , t o allow t he t ransm it t er
t o send t he dat a .
m n021 [ s] : If t he t ransm it t er receives successfully t he CTS packet
from t he dest inat ion , t hen it will be able t o send eh t he packet , t he
dat a packet .
m n021 [ s] : If not , it will h uh , back off , and it will ret ry uh som et im e
lat er .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK ?
m n021 [ s.%−] : So t he m ain idea [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : And t he m edia is [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] is st ill
occupied during t hat period ,
m n082 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m n021 [ h] : Uh .
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m n021 [ s^ aa^ r] : Yes .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s^ df] : The idea is uh , if I want t o send you som et hing , I
[ disfm arker] first of all , I need you t o answer m e t o be sure t hat you
are m y neighbor now
m n021 [ s^ df] : because m aybe y ou are off or m aybe you are uh t oo far
away ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : and also because t hat way Miguel , for exam ple , it m ay
be is not being able t o hearing m e will hear your CTS and will know t hat
y ou are about t o receive uh dat a from m e .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ?
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ s] : in fact , forcing t he receiver t o t ransm it for a short period
of t im e is also uh , used t o signal all t he uh receiver neighbors t hat a
recept a recept ion is t aking place .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK ?

m n082 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s] : I didn’t get it .
m n082 [ fh|qw] : Um , what happened when I sent an RTS packet ?
m n082 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t hen t he m edia st ill occupied for m e ?
m n082 [ qrr] : Or , is anybody allowed also t o send RTS packet s ?
m n021 [ s.%−] : Or ev erybody [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ df] : Because if I go t o an int erm ediat e node , m aybe you
are com m unicat ing t o m e
m n082 [ s^ df] : and I am t he int erm ediat e node t o t he final dest inat ion
Michael .
m n082 [ s^ df] : And Michael send also som e RTS packet in t he t im e
and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] uh uh uh Jordi t oo and what ever .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : Then you will never com e t o a really [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ df] : t hen you ’re always exchanging RTS and non −
acknowledgem ent packet s for t he RTS .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s] : Two [ disfm arker] t wo t hings .
m n082 [ s] : So t hat ’s uh [ disfm arker] t hat ’s uh , m y [ disfm arker] m y
problem .
m n021 [ s] : First of all , [ pause] eh , t his [ disfm arker] t his m echanism
is only a m edia access cont rolled m echanism ,
m n021 [ s] : so it is not connect ed [ pause] wit h rout ing [ pause] eh ,
anyhow .
m n082 [ s^ ba] : Then , fine .
m n021 [ s] : And , second point ,
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ fh] : eh
m n082 [ s^ bu] : So it ’s only relat ed t o t he direct neighbor wit hin t he
scope of t he [ pause] t ransm issions ?
m n021 [ s.%−] : RTS [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n021 [ s] : RTS packet s can collide [ pause] t o [ pause] ot her RTS
packet s .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s] : So , [ pause] t his m echanism [ pause] is not [ pause] uh
prev ent ing [ pause] collisions ,
m n021 [ s] : it is prevent ing only dat a collisions .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ %−] : So t he [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s:s^ bk] : And [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] you can say " OK ,
m n021 [ s:qw] : but what is t he [ disfm arker] what t he benefit is ? "
m n021 [ s] : The benefit is t hat , eh RTS packet s and CTS packet s are
short packet s ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : really short packet s .

m n021 [ s^ e] : Let ’s say eh [ pause] eh 30 byt es or less .
m n082 [ s^ na] : I assum e so .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s] : while dat a packet s can be m uch m or m uch bigger .
m n021 [ s^ e] : Let ’s say uh one − K , five − K − s .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n082 [ s^ ba] : Fine .
m n021 [ s] : a collision in t his short packet [ pause] is only wast ing a
sm all am ount of t im e .
m n021 [ fh] : And , uh
m n021 [ s] : if t hat way we can warrant y t hat t here is [ disfm arker] t here
are [ disfm arker] t here is no collision uh uh , bet ween dat a packet ,
well , t his [ disfm arker] t his is [ disfm arker] t his m eans a [ disfm arker] a
huge eh increase in net work t hroughput ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : because we well , we [ disfm arker] we only wast e really
sm all t im e colliding .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n082 [ s] : but t hat m eans , in principle , t hat on t he MAC layer you
have alway s a RTS CTS [ pause] packet bet ween neighboring nodes ,
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s] : and you send aft erwards t he dat a .
m n082 [ s^ bu] : But t he dat a will be m aybe delayed in t he [ pause]
int erm ediat e node because you have always be assured t o be uh s uh
uh RTS and CTS packet s are changed before [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
before you can forewarning t he dat a ,
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ df] : It is a reservat ion m echanism ,
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ fh] : so
m n021 [ s] : if reserv at ion [ pause] doesn’t work OK , if uh one
reservat ion don’t succeed t hen , uh , t his t ransm ission should have t o
wait .
m n082 [ s.%−] : Now t he p
m n021 [ s^ e.%−−] : unt il t he reservat ion [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n021 [ s^ bk] : yeah ,
m n021 [ s^ co.%−] : let m e [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ cs.%−−] : Maybe it ’s bet t er t o [ disfm arker] t o uh , [ pause]
draw it on t he [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ ba] : Oops .
m n021 [ s^ co.%−−] : l let m e [ disfm arker]

m n082 [ fg|s^ cs] : So , m aybe m y idea first .
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : So t his is what , node one ?
m n082 [ s] : This is node t wo
m n082 [ s] : and t his is t he source ,
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s] : and t his is node t hree t hat is t he final dest inat ion .
m n021 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ co] : Fo − fo for forget [ disfm arker] forget about rout ing .
m n082 [ %] : Yeah ?
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah .
m n082 [ s^ aa] : OK .
m n082 [ s^ cs] : But − but anyway , I would like t o do t hat in t he ad − hoc
net work .
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : This is m aybe t he sco t his is wit hin t he scope [ pause]
of t his , uh [ pause] special net work .
m n082 [ s^ df] : That m eans here t hat is uh wit hin t he t ransm ission
power .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : So if I send [ pause] an RTS , and get back
, [ pause] um , a CTS , t hen he is allowed t o send dat a , right ?
m n021 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s^ 2] : a CTS .
m n021 [ s^ na] : That ’s OK .
m n082 [ s] : So . In t he m eant im e , when he get s t his one , he also had
t o send RTS [ nonv ocalsound] and t hen CTS
m n082 [ s^ df] : because t his is t he next next scope of t he t ransm ission
area ,
m n021 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s|qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : and t hen he can send t he dat a , right ?
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : That ’s t he case ?
m n021 [ s^ na] : That ’s it .
m n021 [ %−] : That ’s [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ?
m n082 [ s] : And t hat ’s what I m ean .
m n082 [ s] : In t he m eant im e , he c st ill can get som e dat a here ,
where he t ry t o get cert ain connect ivit y on t he MAC layer .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s^ bk|s^ nd] : Yeah , but eh [ pause] a node is only [ disfm arker]
is only involved in one t ransm ission at a given t im e .
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ s^ df] : if now t wo has uh m m m answer wit h t he [ disfm arker]
wit h t he CTS , it will be wait ing unt il t he dat a t hat has t o com e .
m n082 [ qy ^ bh] : Yeah ?
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?

m n082 [ s^ rt ] : and t hen he t ry t o forward t his dat a .
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ e] : Aft er t hat .
m n021 [ s^ df] : But n not before .
m n082 [ s^ bu] : So he is definit ely first t o st op .
m n082 [ s^ bu] : He has t o collect all t he dat a ?
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ aa|s.%−] : Yeah , you cannot [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ qy ^ rt ] : Could it not be a lit t le bit st range
m n082 [ s^ df] : because if t hat is st art ing a file t ransfer wit h m illions of

[ disfm arker] t o what ever .
m n021 [ s^ ar] : No , no , no .
m n021 [ s^ df] : But [ disfm arker] we are [ disfm arker] we are t alking only
about a dat a packet .
m n082 [ qw^ rt ] : Huh ?
m n082 [ s.%−−] : One dat a p
m n021 [ s^ e] : at t he MAC layer .
m n082 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : He hav e t o do it for all dat a packet s ?
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ s^ bu] : So but , in principle , [ pause] when he receives t he
dat a packet t hen he [ disfm arker] The sam e applies for t he next dat a
packet .
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ na] : All t he packet s ,
m n021 [ s^ e^ na] : all unicast packet s .
m n082 [ s^ bu] : but anyway in t he m eant im e he has t o forward t he

m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ aa] : That [ disfm arker] t hat t rue .
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m n021 [ s^ aa^ r] : That ’s t rue .
m n082 [ s.%−] : So it ’s act ing , in [ disfm arker] in prin
m n021 [ s^ e] : But not in t he m eant im e .
m n021 [ s] : Aft er receiving [ disfm arker] You know , in fact , probably
t he rout ing prot ocol [ pause] will need t o check t he address
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he let ’s say IP address , which is inside
t he dat a packet ,
m n082 [ b] : OK .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ fh] : so ,
m n021 [ s] : y ou cannot [ disfm arker] u usually you cannot , uh , read
t he dat a packet unt il you [ disfm arker] [ pause] t he recept ion is over .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?

m n021 [ s^ df] : because [ pause] usually your net work hardware only
prov ides you a copy of a packet aft er ou a [ disfm arker] a successful

m n021 [ s^ df] : and usually you know t hat recept ion is successful if
ev ery bit has passed t he CRC check .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : You hav e checked t hat t he [ disfm arker] t hat t his fram e

m n082 [ %] : Naja t o [ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n082 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , @ @ .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ fg] : So
m n030 [ fg|s] : Um , a furt her quest ion .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n030 [ fh] : Um .
m n021 [ s^ ba] : That ’s OK .
m n030 [ qy ] : Am I right t hat t his um dialogue does not prevent um any

.
m n021 [ s^ aa|s^ co] : Yeah , let m e [ disfm arker] let m e put som e
special represent at ion of what we are doing .
m n030 [ %−] : S
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : This is t he t ransm it t ing [ pause] node ,
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : t his is t he receiving [ pause] node ,
m n021 [ s] : and t hese t wo areas , of course , t here ’s som et hing like
t his , are t he uh places of t he [ pause] t ot al space where you can hear
t he [ disfm arker] Here , t his one is t he RTS and t his one is t he CTS .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s.%−−] : So , any node ,
m n021 [ s] : for exam ple , t his node [ pause] is a neighbor of t he
receiv ing node ,
m n030 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s] : but it is not a neighbor of t he t ransm it t ing node .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : That ’s it .
m n021 [ s] : So when t his node hears t he CTS t ransm ission t hat is

m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?

m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ s] : in fact , t his node will avoid any furt her t ransm ission unt il
uh t his recept ion , t hat will st art in [ disfm arker] in a m om ent , is over .
m n030 [ s] : But t hen t his node , um , t his t ransm ission is uh abort ed .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n082 [ s] : And delayed .
m n030 [ s] : And so t here ’s no advant age t o uh [ disfm arker] if it ’s
abort ed , by [ disfm arker] by any dat a packet s .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n030 [ s] : So t his um node has t o st op each t ransm ission .
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

m n021 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n030 [ qy^ g^ rt ] : Is t hat right ?
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n030 [ s^ bu] : So , his t ransm ission is abort ed .
m n082 [ s] : Yeah , but t his is t y pical for MAC layer prot ocols , you know
.
m n021 [ %−−] : Not [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n021 [ s^ ar^ r] : No .
m n082 [ %−] : That ’s [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ co] : Let m e [ disfm arker] let m e [ disfm arker] let m e
[ disfm arker] show you one t hing .
m n021 [ s|qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : If t his node was t ransm it t ing before , it should
uh it should ha uh [ pause] t ransm it an RTS packet in advance , OK ?
m n030 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s] : So t his node should hear it before .
m n030 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n030 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s] : So t his node [ pause] is [ disfm arker] W won’t be sending

m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n030 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s] : So t his t ransm ission [ pause] won’t t ake place .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n030 [ s^ bk] : yeah .

m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s] : so y ou know t hat t he am ount of t im e you have t o wait unt il
y ou can t ry t o get t he cont rol , or t t ry t o send your own t ransm ission .
m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n030 [ s] : but t his scenario is also nov uh , only working if um bot h or
all nodes hav e t he sam e range of t ransm ission .
m n030 [ s^ df] : So , t he s sam e radius of t he sending range .
m n021 [ h|s^ aa] : Mm m , yeah .
m n030 [ s^ bu] : So ot herwise um t his one node m aybe [ pause] um
[ pause] would hear [ pause] his neighbor but not vice versa .
m n021 [ h|s^ nd] : Uh , well , we are assum ing t hat uh m m m all t he
[ disfm arker] all t he t ransm issions are bidirect ional .
m n021 [ fh|s^ am ] : I m ean , uh you know it depends .
m n021 [ s^ am ^ df] : It depends m ainly on [ disfm arker] on [ pause] t he
ant enna gain and t he t ransm ission power and t he receiver uh [ pause]
t hreshold .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n082 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n030 [ s^ ng] : But I ’m t hinking about t his exam ple you gave [ pause]
before .
m n082 [ s^ am ] : Maybe [ disfm arker] m aybe you are right .

m n021 [ %] : S
m n021 [ s] : So what [ disfm arker] what we are assum ing is t hat all t he
nodes behave ex act ly t he sam e regarding t o uh t ransm ission and
receiv ing signals .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah ,
m n082 [ s] : but , Miguel , t his is a good point from [ disfm arker] from
Diet m ar ,
m n030 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s] : but m ay be here is a wall .
m n082 [ s] : And t his guy is behind t he wall , so [ pause] his
t ransm ission rat e is som et hing like t hat .
m n021 [ fg] : Yeah but [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ fg] : yeah
m n021 [ s] : but t he [ disfm arker] but in t his case , you know t his
[ disfm arker] t his idea , t his uh geom et ric idea , can be [ disfm arker]
can be , if y ou want , uh deform ed because of som e obst acles .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : But t his wall is working bot h ways .
m n021 [ s^ df] : It is not only m aking t his node not t o hear t his one , it
’s also m aking t his one not t o hear t his node .
m n030 [ s.%−] : But one of t he [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ s.%−−] : if t hey [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s] : Because of t his wall , if t hey are not neighbors , well , we
can represent t his put t ing t his node like here .
m n030 [ s] : But one of t he um senders could be m uch st ronger t han
t he ot her one .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s^ ar|s^ ng] : No , but t his is not t he scenario we are assum ing
.
m n030 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
m n030 [ fg] : OK .
m n030 [ s] : So t hat was m y quest ion .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ b] : OK .
m n021 [ s] : We are assum ing all t he nodes are exact ly t he sam e .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ fh|s] : Uh , so t hey t ransm it t he sam e power ,
m n021 [ s] : and t hey uh have t he sam e uh uh sensit ivit y .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s.%−−] : So t hey can hear [ disfm arker]
m n030 [ b] : OK .
m n021 [ s^ e] : If [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] if I can hear you , you can
hear m e .
m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n021 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and t he opposit e works also .
m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : if you cannot hear m e , I cannot hear you .
m n030 [ fg] : But [ disfm arker]
m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n030 [ s] : It ’s a assum pt ion it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s clear .
m n030 [ qr.%−−] : But on t he ot her hand , um , in a real world it isn’t , or
[ disfm arker] ?
m n030 [ fh] : Um .
m n021 [ qy^ d.%−−] : In a ?
m n030 [ s.%−] : In real scenarios , uh , you have t o [ disfm arker]
m n035 [ s.%−] : It [ disfm arker] It is act ually [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ h|s^ nd] : Uh [ pause] not really ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : but also depends on uh y ou know , for exam ple power
relat ionships , and ant enna relat ionships .
m n030 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n021 [ %−−] : You know , eh
m n030 [ s^ na] : eh t hat ’s it .
m n021 [ %−] : Because [ disfm arker]
m n030 [ s.%−−] : A car or [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s.%−−] : because for ex am ple , uh [ pause] one kind of t hing ,
m n021 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , if I use a direct ional ant enna , t his is m aking
t hat in one direct ion ,
m n030 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s] : I ’m get t ing m ore uh [ pause] let ’s say m ore gain t han
anot her .
m n030 [ b] : Yeah ,
m n021 [ s] : And t hat ’s t rue
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s] : but t h t hat [ disfm arker] What is also t rue [ pause] is t hat
one direct ional ant enna works bot h ways .
m n030 [ %−] : That [ disfm arker]
m n030 [ s] : You ’re not assum ing t his .
m n030 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ df] : It provides you [ pause] m ore gain [ pause] when you
are t ransm it t ing but also when you are receiving .
m n021 [ s] : so , in general , in general ev en when [ disfm arker] if t here
[ disfm arker] uh [ pause] if t here i are different ant enna gains , uh , you
’re get t ing m ainly bidirect ional channels .
m n021 [ s^ df] : Only when you have a an im port ant uh power difference
is when l um , t he com m unicat ion can only work one way .
m n030 [ b] : Yeah .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m n021 [ s^ e] : For exam ple , y ou have one big st at ion wit h uh
[ v ocalsound] a lot of t ransm ission power ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : and t hen you have a really sm all m obile uh t hing t hat
can hear perfect ly t he signal from t his uh uh bigger st at ion ,
m n030 [ b] : Yeah .
m n030 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , a cellular phone and a car .
m n021 [ s^ e] : but it has not enough power t o t ransm it som et hing t hat
can be heard here .
m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n030 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ fh] : So um [ pause]
m n021 [ s] : But t his [ disfm arker] t his [ disfm arker] t his is not our
scenario .
m n030 [ fg] : OK .
m n021 [ s^ df] : In our scenario , all t he nodes are exact ly t he sam e .
m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n030 [ b] : OK .
m n021 [ s^ df] : They [ disfm arker] t hey have t he sam e uh signal uh
behav ior .
m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ s] : t his is not a problem for us ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : at least for t he m om ent ,
m n021 [ s^ am ^ e] : m aybe lat er we ’ll see som e differences .
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ s] : You know , t he idea is t hat t his m echanism is a reservat ion
m echanism .
m n021 [ s] : And what we are doing here is t ry t o reserve t he area of
space we are covering
m n021 [ s] : and eh here ’s where our [ pause] som e of our work
[ pause] is done .
m n021 [ s] : The m ain idea [ pause] for [ disfm arker] for our work , is well
, [ pause] if we are using t his reservat ion m echanism , we are reserving
an area of space for a single t ransm ission .
m n021 [ fh|s] : Uh , if t his area is bigger t han what is really needed , we
are , som ehow , wast ing a lit t le bit of space .
m n021 [ fh] : So , uh
m n021 [ s] : our first eh work in t his area [ pause] was [ pause] t o st udy
different m echanism s [ pause] t o t ry t o adjust [ pause] t hese
t ransm ission values ,
m n021 [ s] : t hese uh t he area , t he covered area , [ pause] for a single
t ransm ission , t rying t o get a m inim um value ,
m n021 [ s] : so [ pause] we can [ pause] reduce [ pause] t he not − used
space for ot her sim ult aneous t ransm issions .

m n021 [ s] : And t his will [ pause] lead us t o a [ disfm arker] a bet t er
[ disfm arker] [ pause] t o a bet t er net work t hroughput , t o higher
num ber of sim ult aneous t ransm issions .
m n021 [ s] : And , we have , uh m m m , worked about t his problem
[ pause] uh , in t wo different uh ways .
m n021 [ s] : One of t hese ways has been [ pause] t ry t o find a
m echanism [ pause] t o uh calculat e [ pause] an opt im al value [ pause]
for t he t ransm ission range [ pause] uh , and t o get [ pause] an equal
v alue for all t he t ransm it t ers .
m n021 [ fh|s] : So , [ pause] t he idea in t his first work [ pause] was
[ pause] t o obt ain [ pause] a fixed value [ pause] for t he t ransm ission
range .
m n021 [ s.%−−] : And t he second eh work , uh , it is about [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ ba] : Oops !
m n021 [ s] : It is about uh , an algorit hm t o adapt t he t ransm ission
power for every for every single t ransm ission .
m n021 [ fh|s] : So , uh , in t his second part of our work , [ pause] we are
using a different value for every single t ransm ission .
m n021 [ fh] : So .
m n021 [ s] : First point , [ pause] what we have proposed is [ pause] a
way [ pause] t o obt ain [ pause] t he t ransm ission [ pause] range [ pause]
uh [ pause] for uh for an escenario where we know t he num ber of
nodes
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : and t he area of deploym ent , [ pause] we have a
[ disfm arker] a fix ed area , where we deploy all t he nodes ,
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : we have a fixed num ber of nodes ,
m n021 [ s] : and , [ pause] uh we assum e t hat t hese nodes are m oving
[ pause] freely around t his [ disfm arker] t his area
m n021 [ s] : and , uh , what we have present ed , [ pause] is a
m echanism [ pause] t o uh calculat e [ pause] t o obt ain [ pause] t he eh
[ pause] t ransm ission [ pause] radius t hat [ pause] provides at t he
sam e t im e [ disfm arker] t hat prov ide us [ pause] t he bet t er t hroughput
possible [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ bsc] : t he bet t er possible t hroughput ,
m n021 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g.%] : OK ?
m n021 [ s^ e] : but wit hout our net work get t ing part it ioned ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : which is a problem t hat we are t rying t o avoid .
m n021 [ s^ df] : You know , if we have , because of node m ot ion , we
have som et hing like t his ,
m n021 [ s] : t his is t he deploym ent area of [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker]
or node ,
m n021 [ s] : and if we have som e nodes here and som e nodes here ,
[ pause] well m aybe t hese nodes in t his area , cannot reach t he nodes
on t his ot her area .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ qw] : Uh , so [ pause] what can we do t o avoid t his ?

m n021 [ s] : Of course we can choose uh our t ransm ission values
longer enough t o reach from [ pause] so t he nodes from t his area will
be able t o reach t he nodes on t his ot her area .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : But , again , we can assum e t hat eh if uh , nodes are
m ov ing , [ pause] uh [ pause] m ore or less uh [ pause] in a random
fashion , t his configurat ion is not very likely t o happen .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : So [ pause] t he point we ha what we have done [ pause] is
t o present a m echanism would pr which provides [ pause] uh [ pause]
one uh [ pause] v alue for a given uh [ pause] m m m [ pause] probabilit y .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : So we can say t hat uh [ pause] a given eh value are
[ pause] @ @ for [ disfm arker] for t he t ransm ission range , will be OK for
a giv en num ber of nodes , if [ pause] we [ disfm arker] Sorry . for a
cert ain , for a cert ain probabilit y .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : So , t he point is uh , we cannot say t hat t his is not gonna
happen ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : what we can say is t his is not very likely t o happen ,
[ pause] if nodes m ove uh uh random .
m n082 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , but um Miguel , [ pause] if uh in t he previous
slide y ou m ent ioned t hat you uh are working also on adapt ive power
cont rol .
m n021 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n082 [ qy ] : Is it not possible t hen , if I send som et hing and I could
not find any neighbor because one of t he clust er below ,
m n021 [ s] : This is t he next .
m n021 [ s^ bk|%−] : Yeah , t h
m n082 [ qy] : is it not possible t o ext end t he power unt il t he m axim um
m n021 [ %] : u
m n082 [ s^ bu] : and if uh I do not have any connect ivit y wit h t he
m ax im um of power , OK , t hen I ’m lost any way .
m n021 [ %] : e
m n021 [ %] : e
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n082 [ b] : Yeah , yeah .
m n021 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] t his is [ disfm arker] t his is a way t hat it is
[ disfm arker] it is being explored by ot her researchers ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : but not [ disfm arker] not uh , by m e .
m n021 [ fh|s] : But uh , t here is , uh [ pause] one , at least one person
who is [ disfm arker] who is doing what t hey call " t opology cont rol " ,
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .

m n021 [ s] : and t his is , uh [ pause] relat ed t o [ disfm arker] t o uh t he
cont rol of t he t ransm ission power t o get uh [ pause] cert ain propert ies
uh from y our net work ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : like for exam ple , t hey are [ disfm arker] what t hey are
doing eh is eh som e people working for BBN
m n021 [ s^ e] : Ram Ram anat an is t he researcher ,
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s^ e] : and t he art icle is [ disfm arker] is uh I t hink from
[ disfm arker] from t his year ,
m n021 [ fh] : and eh
m n021 [ s] : t hese guys are doing eh what t hey call uh " B − connect ed

m n021 [ s^ df] : t hey are t rying all t he net work nodes t o have at least
t wo neighbors .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n082 [ s^ bk] : m m − hm m .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s^ df] : And t hey are cont rolling t he power t o eh t his g uh
m m m get t his [ disfm arker] [ pause] t his num ber of neighbors ,
m n021 [ s] : but t his is not what I am doing
m n021 [ s] : and uh t he kind of power cont rol I am doing uh , um , is
m ore or less [ pause] present ed here ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : and what we are doing is t o t ransm it uh [ pause] wit h
t he m inim um power needed depending on t he dist ance t o t he
dest inat ion .
m n021 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : Every t ransm ission is supposed t o be done t o a cert ain
neighbor node
m n021 [ s] : we cull t he neighbors t o t hese nodes which are [ pause] uh
closer t han a given dist ance ,
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : and because we want ed t o [ disfm arker] t o com pare our
algorit hm wit h som et hing , we needed t o com pare it wit h t he no power
cont rol ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : which is t he usual uh m echanism at t his eh m edia
access cont rol lev el .
m n021 [ s] : So , what we are doing here is t o [ disfm arker] t o com pare
our m echanism against t he no power cont rol ,
m n021 [ s.%−−] : but again we have t o fix [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s] : in order t o be able t o com pare , we have t o fix a given
what ev er , but a given uh m axim um t ransm ission range t o com pare .
m n021 [ fh|s] : And , uh [ pause] what we are doing is [ pause] we are
uh [ pause] t aking t he advant age t hat we are u we have t his RTS CTS
dialogue , in adv ance , before sending t he dat a , t o uh [ pause] agree
wit h t he receiver , t he power level he is willing t o get from us .
m n021 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : OK ,

m n021 [ s] : so every single t ransm ission [ disfm arker] in every single
t ransm ission we are checking wit h t he receiver t he power level we
have t o use for t he dat a t ransm ission .
m n021 [ s] : That ’s t he m ain t hing .
m n021 [ s.%−] : And [ disfm arker] as , uh [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ qw.%−−] : And how do you [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ fa] : sorry Miguel [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ qw^ rt ] : how do you check if [ disfm arker] if t he nodes are
m ov ing random ly ?
m n021 [ s] : Well , uh we are assum ing t hat e y for [ disfm arker] at least
for uh [ pause] v eh uh you know , uh , car and [ disfm arker] and walking

m n021 [ fh] : You know ,
m n021 [ s^ e.%−] : in one m illisec
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , OK ,
m n082 [ s] : m ay be t hat ’s applied for RTS CTS ,
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ ng^ rt ] : but for t he real fram e ?
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n021 [ s.%−] : well , you just t ake t he [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ df] : The fram e could also be uh what ever , [ pause] I don’t

m n021 [ %−−] : Let ’s [ disfm arker] let ’s [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ ar|%−] : no but [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah but , i let ’s say y ou have one kilobyt e .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s^ e] : One kilobyt e is uh [ pause] eight uh bit s .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ fh|s] : And eh , if you are t ransm it t ing at , let ’s say , uh at one

m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : So t his only is t aking eight m illiseconds ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : which is not a lot of t im e if you are t rav elling , let ’s say ,
at uh one hundred kilom et ers per second .
m n082 [ s^ ar|%−−] : No , s

m n082 [ s^ na] : m Yeah , t hat ’s right .
m n021 [ s^ fa] : Sorry .
m n082 [ s] : But first of all it t ook place RTS CTS ,

m n021 [ s^ df] : I m ean , it will be a st art wit h anot her RTS CTS .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Oh ,

m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?

m n082 [ s] : Yeah , what I t hink [ disfm arker] Maybe som e , uh [ pause]
cases why I go t his way wit h m y node , and suddenly , I s go out of t he
scope of t he t ransm ission area ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : because it ’s really a random m ovem ent .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : Then I st ill hear [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ e] : t his is during t he dat a t ransm ission .
m n021 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker] again [ disfm arker] again ,
what we are adding wit h t his behavior is , uh [ pause] uh [ pause] a
lit t le bit m ore , probably som e [ disfm arker] som e uh sm all part t o t he
uh bit error rat e .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ?
m n082 [ %] : t hen [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : May be t his fram e will [ disfm arker] won’t be received
properly , and , should eh [ pause] hav e t o be eh dropped ,
m n082 [ b] : Oh , yeah .
m n021 [ fg] : but any way ,
m n021 [ fh|s] : eh [ pause] even if nodes are com plet ely st at ic , eh
som e problem s will happen [ pause] in t he wireless t ransm ission ,
m n021 [ fh] : so
m n021 [ s^ df] : we won’t have a hundred percent eh perfect eh
channel any way .
m n082 [ b] : Yep .
m n082 [ b] : Right .
m n021 [ fh|s] : So eh [ pause] if t his problem , as you show it [ pause]
probably it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s eh [ disfm arker] [ pause] Y you can
[ disfm arker] you can see t hat it is not very likely t o happen ,
m n021 [ s^ df.%−] : because [ pause] you [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker]
y ou eh have t o consider t he probabilit y t hat o of happening t his
[ disfm arker]
m n082 [ fg] : Nee .
m n082 [ s^ na] : That ’s really right ,
m n021 [ b] : Hm m ?
m n082 [ s^ cs^ ng] : but what I would like t o say is t hat besides t he RTS
CTS behav ior , y ou need cert ain kind of addit ional MAC layer
funct ionalit y t o deal wit h t hese packet .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ s^ e] : For exam ple , wit h t ransm ission or [ disfm arker] or
what ev er ,
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n021 [ s^ aa] : sure , sure .
m n082 [ s^ e] : for what ever cont rol , or what ever kind of t hings , you
know .

m n021 [ s] : In fact [ disfm arker] in fact , you know I [ disfm arker] I
[ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I [ pause] m aybe I [ disfm arker]
I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] had t o [ disfm arker] t o prepare a m ore
det ailed eh , v iew ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : I [ disfm arker] I just was t rying t o do som et hing soft ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : not t o [ disfm arker] t o bore t h t he public
m n021 [ s^ df] : but of course t here are a lot of ot her sm art eh t hings
t hat are built in , in t hese prot ocols ,
m n082 [ b] : Right .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ e] : like for exam ple , an aut om at ic , uh [ pause]
acknowledgem ent .
m n021 [ s] : Som e prot ocols used uh [ pause] in t he sam e way as t his
RTS and CTS packet [ disfm arker] som e of t hem use , an eh
acknowledge from t he receiver ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : which is also a short packet ,
m n021 [ s] : so you [ disfm arker] you are get t ing som e kind of link layer
uh [ pause] acknowledgem ent schem e
m n021 [ s^ e] : which can save a lot of dat a t ransm issions
m n021 [ s^ df] : because eh usually when you send a [ disfm arker]
[ pause] a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a fram e , you will want t o
[ disfm arker] som e kind of acknowledgem ent back .
m n021 [ s^ df] : So , if t his acknowledgem ent has t o go t hrough t he
process of a new RTS and a new CTS , well , t his t akes longer t han just
a link lay er uh , ex t ra packet .
m n021 [ s] : That , of course uh [ pause] is also cont em plat ed in t his eh
packet lengt h [ disfm arker] lengt h or [ disfm arker] included in t he RTS
and CTS packet s ,
m n021 [ fh|s] : so , eh , you know , everybody can wait unt il t his uh
acknowledgem ent is also t ransm it t ed by t he receiver .
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ s] : in fact , eh nnn [ pause] som e people proposing t his
m echanism is [ disfm arker] is showing a [ disfm arker] a b a big
im provem ent
m n021 [ fh|s] : and eh t here are a lot of ot her m echanism s , also
regarding and a t im e − out m echanism , or t he t im e − out algorit hm for
t hese ret ries when you [ pause] t ry t o send som et hing [ pause] and you
don’t succeed , uh , what [ disfm arker] what you t he am ount of t im e
y ou hav e t o wait unt il you ret ry again .
m n021 [ s] : Well , uh , som e people is also proposing different t hings ,
different eh algorit hm s wit h different result s .
m n021 [ fh|s.%−−] : So , in fact , t here are a lot of good [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ df] : I just [ pause] was t rying t o present a [ disfm arker] you
know [ pause] t he m ain ideas .

m n021 [ s] : So , I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] you know ,
ask uh [ disfm arker] You [ disfm arker] Feel free t o ask uh what ever you
want ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : but [ pause] I [ disfm arker] I want t o insist t hat [ pause]
it was just an [ disfm arker] uh a sim plified uh [ pause] version , a light
v ersion .
m n021 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ?
m n021 [ fh|s] : well , uh [ pause] you know finally t his algorit hm , eh , as
I was t elling , eh what it ’s doing is t o check [ pause] wit h t he receiver
[ pause] t he power level t o be used .
m n021 [ s] : And it is very sim ple t o see t hat som e advant ages [ pause]
can [ disfm arker] som e advant age can be obt ained ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : because [ pause] t he difference is [ pause] eh if you
don’t hav e power cont rol , you are using all t he t im e t he m axim um
power ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : if y ou have power cont rol , [ pause] som et im es you will
use [ pause] less [ pause] t han t he m ax im um power
m n021 [ qw] : How oft en [ pause] do you use less power t han t he
m ax im um ?
m n021 [ s^ df] : Well , t his will [ disfm arker] [ pause] t his will be
connect ed t o t he m ot ion pat t ern .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : Depending how nodes are m oving ,
m n021 [ s^ rt .%−−] : well [ pause] m ay be [ pause] all t he t im e [ pause] all
y our neighbors are at t he m axim um dist ance
m n021 [ s] : But , t his probably , doesn’t l look like uh som et hing very
[ pause] v ery uh [ pause] [ pause] very likely .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n021 [ s^ df] : because well , l [ pause] probably y [ pause] what you
will hav e [ pause] will be som e neighbors t hat are [ pause] really close
m n082 [ b] : Hm m .
m n021 [ s] : ot hers t hat are a lit t le bit [ pause] far away
m n021 [ s] : and finally , [ pause] t hese neighbors t hat are in t he
[ disfm arker] [ pause] in t he front ier [ pause] of your [ disfm arker] of your

m n021 [ b.%] : OK .
m n082 [ b] : Hm m .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ fg|s] : OK , t his is a quest ion not direct ly relat ed t o t hese
t hings ,
m n082 [ s] : but m aybe [ disfm arker] t hat ’s why m ay be only a short
answer .
m n082 [ qy^ rt ] : Uh , do you assum e t hat [ pause] power cont rol will be

m n082 [ s^ e] : In ot her words , um [ pause] is [ pause] t he [ pause] um
[ pause] success of having m ore power wit hin t he devices in m aybe
t hree y ear , four years , five years , for bat t eries , and [ disfm arker] and
[ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] @ @ and sofort so on
m n082 [ qy ] : uh will it be succeeded t hat you have so m uch power
av ailable t hat t his [ pause] difficult m echanism who is in t he wireless
net work will be uh out of scope ?
m n021 [ b] : Mm m .
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ df] : Because if I have a dev ice which uh can I use m aybe for
t went y − four hours ,
m n082 [ s^ df^ e] : I do not have , in principle , really t he const raint
[ pause] t o uh deal wit h [ disfm arker] wit h uh power savings .
m n021 [ fg|s] : Yeah , let [ disfm arker] let m e [ disfm arker] let m e answer
y ou uh wit h a quest ion .
m n021 [ qy ] : Uh , If , for exam ple , your car [ pause] uh you [ disfm arker]
y ou hav e uh an endless [ pause] uh source of [ disfm arker] of gas , do
y ou t hink [ pause] it will [ disfm arker] it will be a problem , [ pause] t he
am ount of gas y our [ disfm arker] y our car is [ disfm arker] is using ?
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s] : It won’t be [ pause] a problem for your pocket ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : for y our wallet ,
m n021 [ s] : but m aybe [ pause] it will be a problem for [ pause] t he

m n021 [ s] : So , [ pause] I t hink t hat t he answer [ pause] t o your

m n021 [ s^ bd] : t hat [ pause] uh if you have an endless uh source of
power , [ pause] well , m aybe it ’s not a problem , [ pause] for t he
bat t ery uh last ing .
m n021 [ s^ df^ rt ] : But , it is a problem because [ pause] you are using

m n021 [ s] : And t herefore you are prev ent ing ot her t ransm issions t o
t ake place [ pause] at t he sam e t im e .
m n021 [ s] : And t herefore [ pause] uh t he problem is not only
connect ed t o [ disfm arker] t o t he [ disfm arker] t o t he power
m n021 [ s] : it is also connect ed t o t he net t o t he global net work
t hroughput .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ?
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s.%−−] : But , [ pause] again , uh , you know , uh [ pause] t he
[ disfm arker] t he m
m n021 [ s.%−−] : If you ask m e " what [ disfm arker] what do you t hink
what will happen , [ pause] in t he indust ry ? "

m n021 [ s] : What I t hink t hat will happen is t hat t hey will [ pause] t ry t o
get [ pause] uh [ pause] m m m [ pause] bet t er [ pause] hardware t han
we have now
m n021 [ s^ df] : because now [ pause] t he problem [ pause] wit h
t ransceivers [ pause] is t hat a lot of power [ pause] is uh [ pause]
consum ed [ pause] at t he logic of t he t ransceiver ,
m n021 [ s^ df^ e] : and not [ pause] uh t ransm it t ed t o t he air .
m n021 [ s^ e] : It is not power t ransferred t o t he air .
m n021 [ s] : So , [ pause] t he problem now [ pause] is t hat eh m ost of
t he power [ pause] uh , uh t uh a wireless net work [ pause] card
[ pause] is consum ing , [ pause] is [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] is drawn
[ pause] by t he [ disfm arker] by t he eh logic cont rol of t he card .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ e] : All t he [ disfm arker] all t he calculat ions ,
m n082 [ %−] : That ’s what I [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ e.%−] : all t he hardware [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ fg|s^ df.%−] : Yeah , t hat was t he reason I ’m t alking about t his
is uh [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s] : So , I am sure t hat eh [ disfm arker] t hat m anufact urers will
t ry t o [ disfm arker] t o squeeze unt il t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker]
[ pause] t he last am pere f of [ disfm arker] [ pause] of t his eh , let ’s say
, [ pause] eh [ pause] wast ed power ,
m n021 [ s^ df.%−−] : because [ pause] what you cannot avoid is , uh
m n021 [ s] : t o p l t he part of t he [ disfm arker] of t he radio frequency

m n021 [ s] : I m ean , t his is [ disfm arker] t his cannot be avoided .
m n021 [ s.%−−] : But what you can avoid or you can reduce
m n021 [ s.%−−] : and probably
m n021 [ s^ df] : because now it is t he m ain fact or , t he m ain

m n021 [ s] : In t he sam e way , at [ disfm arker] as [ disfm arker] as it

m n021 [ s] : Now [ pause] processors [ pause] are m uch m ore [ pause]
uh power efficient t han before .
m n021 [ s^ f] : OK ?
m n082 [ fg|s^ bd] : Yeah , but anyway , t hat was t he reason for m y

m n082 [ s] : If I save wit h a lot of difficult m echanism , wit hin t he air

m n021 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ fh|qy] : uh [ pause] is it wort h t o have it ?

m n082 [ s] : As t he m ore m obile nodes are in t he world t he bet t er t he

m n082 [ s] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker] was t he reason for m y quest ion .
m n021 [ s^ bk|%−] : Yeah , pero e
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah , y eah .
m n021 [ %−−] : uh but [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ fa] : Oh , sorry !
m n021 [ s] : But even if you [ disfm arker] if you don’t have t o
[ disfm arker] t o worry about eh y our power source , [ pause] you have
t o worry about y our environm ent ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : about not using m ore resources [ pause] t hat you don’t

m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n040 [ fg] : Ex cuse m e @ @ .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n040 [ s^ cs] : If I underst ood correct ly , t he m echanism eh [ pause]
y ou should eh [ pause] look for um t he m inim um eh [ pause] coverage

m n021 [ b] : Yeah .
m n040 [ s^ df] : in order t o m axim ize t he t hroughput of t he net work .
m n021 [ b] : Yeah .
m n040 [ s.%−] : So t here [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he power

eh [ pause] eh m ore t ransm issions uh
m n040 [ s^ 2] : m ay t ake [ disfm arker] t ake place at t he sam e t im e .
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : Can t ake place at t he sam e t im e .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
m n040 [ s^ rt ] : So y ou need t he adapt ive m echanism t o m inim ize t he

m n082 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ ba] : That ’s OK .

m n021 [ s] : And t o [ disfm arker] and t o get t he m axim um net work

m n021 [ s] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he idea .

m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s^ f] : OK ?
m n021 [ s^ df] : because of t he [ disfm arker] of high int erference levels
.
m n021 [ s] : A lot of sim ult aneous t ransm issions [ pause] also m eans
[ pause] for [ pause] each receiver point of view , [ pause] a lot of

m n021 [ s] : The basic [ disfm arker] [ pause] t he basic problem we have
t o solve [ pause] in [ disfm arker] in t hese eh [ pause] rout ing prot ocols
[ pause] is [ pause] t he fast eh [ disfm arker] [ pause] t he fast pace at

one node is m y neighbor ,

m n021 [ s] : So any rout e t hat was going t hrough t his neighbor [ pause]

m n021 [ s] : and t hese prot ocols are t rying t o work on dem and ,
m n021 [ s] : so t hey are t rying [ pause] t o solve on only [ pause] t hese
rout ers [ pause] t hat are needed
m n021 [ s] : so when I want t o send [ pause] uh , a packet t o a
[ disfm arker] a giv en dest inat ion , [ pause] first of all , I have t o [ pause]
figure out t he proper rout e [ pause] for t his packet .
m n021 [ s] : And t hen , [ pause] uh [ pause] I ’m using [ pause] soft
rout ing .
m n021 [ s] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m including on t he [ disfm arker] on t he
[ disfm arker] uh header of t his packet , [ pause] t he set of eh nodes
[ pause] t hat should be forwarding t his node t o t he dest inat ion .
m n021 [ s] : eh [ pause] of course , [ pause] uh t hese uh t wo
approaches can be [ disfm arker] can be uh som ehow m ixed
m n021 [ s] : and som e hybrid proposals are also [ pause] on t he
[ pause] on t he [ pause] paper ,
m n021 [ fh] : and eh
m n021 [ s] : t hese proposals are [ disfm arker] are t rying t o get [ pause]
t he adv ant ages of bot h [ pause] uh m echanism s
m n021 [ s] : eh som e som et im es [ pause] m aking a kind of com binat ion
of [ disfm arker] of t hem
m n021 [ fh|s] : uh , let ’s say , for exam ple , [ pause] using [ pause] uh
[ pause] pract iv e approach [ pause] for t he closer set of nodes ,

m n021 [ s^ rt ] : let ’s say [ pause] for t he neighbors and m aybe [ pause]
t he nex t lev el ,
m n021 [ s] : and , using a react ive approach
m n021 [ s^ e] : I m ean , as our rout ing approach , [ pause] for [ pause]
nodes t hat [ pause] are [ pause] closer t han t his pract ive area .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK ?
m n021 [ s.%−−] : and eh , [ pause] well ,
m n021 [ %−−] : u e a
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : som e m ult icast prot ocols [ pause] have been proposed
[ pause] for t his scenario t oo ,
m n021 [ s] : and , well , t hey have t o deal wit h t he sam e problem s t hat
t hey ’re [ pause] uh [ pause] end − t o − end rout ing prot ocols .
m n082 [ b] : Mm m .
m n082 [ qw] : What do you m ean by m ult icast prot ocols ?
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ bu^ e] : Rout ing ?
m n021 [ s] : Rout ing prot ocols int ended for m ult icast .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK . Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s^ e] : So , for [ disfm arker] for [ disfm arker] uh , for sending
one t o any .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g.%] : Hm m ?
m n021 [ fh|s] : Uh [ pause] well , [ pause] t he m ain [ disfm arker] t he
m ain problem s t hat som e of t he solut ions eh are exhibit ing , [ pause] is
uh [ pause] t he lack of eh scalabilit y
m n021 [ s] : uh m ainly [ pause] t he [ pause] source rout ing prot ocols
[ pause] have a problem when you [ disfm arker] when you scale from
[ disfm arker] or scale [ pause] scale [ pause] badly [ pause] from t ens of
nodes t o [ disfm arker] t o t housands of nodes
m n021 [ s^ df] : because , well , you cannot have [ pause] uh , uh
[ pause] let ’s say , [ pause] uh , an endless uh header lengt h .
m n021 [ s^ e] : You have a lim it ed [ disfm arker] a lim it ed header lengt h .
m n082 [ s] : And m ay be we will hav e t o ex plain a lit t le bit for t hose who
are not fam iliar wit h source rout ing .
m n021 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : You can have t he dest inat ions you would like t o
[ disfm arker] or t he in [ disfm arker] t he I P addresses of t he
int erm ediat e nodes you st ill know
m n021 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ e] : even if it ’s not t he direct neighbor ,
m n082 [ s] : but one of uh where y ou really want t hat t he packet went
t hrough , [ pause] put it in t he I P header .
m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ fh] : So , and ,
m n082 [ s] : t his one is going t hen t o t his guy and so on and so on ,

m n082 [ s^ e] : unt il finally it ’s reached dest inat ion .
m n030 [ s.%−] : So t here are [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : And , t hat ’s what I m ean , you cannot put it [ disfm arker]
t housand int erm ediat e nodes in for exam ple ,
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ s] : but t o put a t housand I P addresses in t he header , so
t hat t he packet is for uh forwarded accordingly t o [ disfm arker]
m n030 [ s^ bu] : So t here ’s m ore t han one IP address in t he header ,
m n082 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
m n030 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK , I see .
m n021 [ s] : Som et hing like t his
m n021 [ s] : So you [ disfm arker] your packet [ pause] should look like
[ disfm arker] like t his way .
m n030 [ qy.%−] : Do t hey have t o [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n030 [ qy^ rt ] : Do t hey have t o be in order ?
m n030 [ s^ e] : So [ pause] you are looking first for node t wo and t hen
for node t hree and so on .
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n082 [ %−−] : It ’s uh [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : You ’ll know t o rem ove h [ pause] it ’s h from t he header , in
principle , and [ disfm arker] and so on , unt il it uh reaches t he final
dest inat ion .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s] : So t his [ disfm arker] t his uh header , well , [ pause] it ’s
[ disfm arker] it ’s a problem .
m n021 [ s] : Of course , t here are also som e [ disfm arker] [ pause] som e
solut ions
m n021 [ s] : like uh [ pause] uh em ploy ing som e kind of [ disfm arker] of
uh [ pause] hierarchical source rout e rout ing ,
m n021 [ s.%−−] : so y ou don’t have t o put [ pause] all [ pause] t he
[ disfm arker] all t he rout e [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : This one , for inst ance .
m n082 [ s] : t hat m ay t hat t he different part s could be one t o num ber
four .
m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n030 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s:s] : May be t wo − B or t hree − B
m n082 [ s] : Yeah , but nevert heless t his guy is a [ disfm arker] is an
gat eway in t he rout er for [ disfm arker] for t his packet , you know .
m n082 [ s] : And t hey rem ove it self from t he header .
m n030 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .

m n021 [ %−] : Anot h
m n082 [ s] : It m ust be not t he whole pat h , you know .
m n021 [ s] : Anot her problem [ pause] eh , is [ pause] eh t rying t o
prov ide som e qualit y of service [ pause] in t hese net works ,
m n021 [ s^ df.%−−] : because , well , [ pause] em uh change is
[ disfm arker] is t he only t hing you know for sure , [ pause] here
m n021 [ s] : So , [ pause] eh [ pause] prov iding qualit y of service is also
[ disfm arker] [ pause] is quit e a challenge [ pause] in [ disfm arker] in t his
net work .
m n021 [ s] : But , again [ pause] uh t here are som e proposals .
m n082 [ qy ^ rt ] : Um , Miguel , are you fam iliar wit h t hese kind of
proposals ?
m n021 [ s^ nd] : Not really .
m n021 [ s^ df.%−−] : Not really , because I don’t t rust [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ fh] : You know ,
m n021 [ s^ ba^ df] : uh , I ’m sure t hat t he proposals are OK ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : but eh [ pause] I don’t [ disfm arker] [ pause] I don’t t hink
t hat [ disfm arker] [ pause] You cannot warr you [ disfm arker] you
[ disfm arker] [ pause] I don’t t hink you can warrant y [ pause] t oo m uch
in t hese net works .
m n021 [ s] : So , I see [ pause] t his like a [ pause] you know , a
[ disfm arker] a t opic I ’m not convinced about .
m n021 [ s^ e] : I don’t t rust you can really provide qualit y of service ,
m n021 [ s.%−] : but of course [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ aap] : That depends on t he service level you want t o be .
m n082 [ s^ e] : Definit ely not a guarant ee level .
m n082 [ s] : But m ay be som et hing like a cont rol load level or som et hing
like t hat , seem s t o be for m e [ pause] possible .
m n021 [ s^ am ] : Yeah .
m n082 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m n021 [ s] : You know , uh if you are curious , uh I can [ disfm arker] I
can [ disfm arker] [ pause] I can provide you t he n [ pause] som e of t he
proposals
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ b] : Hm m .
m n021 [ s.%−] : which include [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ bk|s^ cs] : Yeah , we can discuss lat er , off − line .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s] : And eh , finally , [ pause] t he ot her [ disfm arker] t he ot her
t hing , which is also under research or under st udy [ pause] is , uh t o
have som e kind of a power − aware rout ing .
m n021 [ s] : There are som e proposals , t oo .
m n021 [ s.%−−] : So t hat way you could [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s] : rout ing funct ion could be [ pause] connect ed [ pause] wit h
uh global or local power consum pt ion .

m n021 [ s] : So , for exam ple , you could ask [ pause] t o u nnn , t he
net work t o t ransm it your packet [ pause] wit h t he lowest [ pause] uh
global [ pause] uh consum pt ion
m n021 [ s] : or wit h y our [ pause] lowest [ pause] local consum pt ion , for
ex am ple .
m n021 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ?
m n021 [ s] : I m ean , would t he opt ion for m e t o [ disfm arker] t o use
less power [ pause] when sending a packet is t o send it t o [ pause] t he
closest neighbor .
m n021 [ s^ f|s] : OK , assum ing t hat I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m also using s or
having som e kind of power cont rol t hing .
m n021 [ s] : so t hat way [ pause] t ransm it t ing t o t he closer [ disfm arker]
close [ disfm arker] t o m y closer node , [ pause] is , uh [ pause]
som et hing t hat requires [ pause] less effort [ pause] t han sending t o a
m ore dist ant node .
m n021 [ s] : May be [ pause] t he closer node [ pause] is not a good uh
[ disfm arker] it is not in t he good direct ion t o t he [ disfm arker] t o reach
t he dest inat ion .
m n021 [ s] : But [ pause] it is for sure [ pause] t he [ disfm arker] t he less
ex pensiv e uh [ pause] t hing for m e .
m n021 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ?
m n021 [ s^ bd] : But probably t his uh [ disfm arker] [ pause] t his is not
[ pause] som et hing really useful .
m n021 [ s] : And t hat ca [ pause] what can be u really useful [ pause] is
t o reduce t he global [ pause] power consum pt ion in t he rout ing
funct ion .
m n021 [ %−−] : So ,
m n021 [ s^ df.%−−] : because in t his way ,
m n021 [ s] : well , m aybe one node is [ disfm arker] [ pause] is [ pause]
being forced t o use m ore power
m n021 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] but if we t ake a look at t he whole t hing ,
[ pause] well , we can ask for a [ disfm arker] a low [ pause] consum pt ion
rout e ,
m n021 [ s.%−] : well , t he sam e way
m n082 [ fg|%−] : Yeah , but t he [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s:s] : as we are asking , for exam ple , when we want [ pause]
uh som e packet t o be shipped in t he real life , [ pause] we can go and
say " well , [ pause] we will [ disfm arker] we are happy wit h t his [ pause]
UPS [ pause] ground syst em .
m n021 [ s] : What we want w is t wo − day [ pause] delivery service ,
[ pause] or w t went y − four hours [ pause] service , and we are willing t o
pay m ore or less [ pause] for t his serv ice .
m n082 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , but it ’s [ pause] really happened also in t he
riot case , you know .
m n082 [ s^ e] : If I get t he wrong rout e wit h t he RCMP redirect s , it ’s , in
principle , t hen t he sam e .

m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ ba] : That ’s O K .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah .
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : So , t hese are m ore or less uh som e open problem s ,
m n021 [ s.%−−] : and uh [ pause] well [ pause] just a quick com m ent
about [ disfm arker] probably
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : all of use are [ pause] now aware [ pause] of t he
av ailabilit y [ pause] of t his eh st andard [ pause] t he I − t riple − E eight
hundred and t wo [ pause] point elev en
m n021 [ s] : uh [ pause] in fact it is [ disfm arker] it is [ pause] powering
[ pause] y ou know , uh t he evolut ion of t he [ disfm arker] [ pause] of t he
[ disfm arker] of net working indust ry in t he wireless area .
m n021 [ s.%−−] : And [ pause] in t he beginning , [ pause] t he first
adapt ors [ pause] uh
m n021 [ s^ fa] : Oops !
m n021 [ s^ e] : were [ pause] only one and t wo m egabyt es per second ,
m n021 [ s] : but now we [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker] you can buy for
[ disfm arker] for t he sam e price [ disfm arker] for even t he sam e price
[ pause] uh , t he new eleven m egabyt es per second version
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : I ’ve been [ pause] use it for [ disfm arker] for a while ,
m n021 [ s] : and it w [ pause] can t ell you it works pret t y well .
m n021 [ fh|s] : and uh , [ pause] t he t hing is t hat t hese [ pause] devices
[ pause] have [ pause] t wo different m odes of operat ion .
m n021 [ s] : One of t hem , and probably t he m ost popular , [ pause] is
uh l what we call t he " infrast ruct ure m ode " ,
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : where [ pause] y ou have [ pause] a set of m obile nodes
,
m n021 [ s] : and t hen you have [ pause] one or m ore access point s .
m n021 [ s] : These access point s are uh [ pause] in fact providing
[ pause] t he eh [ pause] required connect ivit y [ pause] from t he m obiles
t o t he [ pause] net work [ pause] t o t he [ pause] m wired net work ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : and from t here t o t he int ernet usually .
m n082 [ fg|s] : Yeah , in principle , t he base st at ion .
m n021 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , yeah , we can call it a base st at ion .
m n082 [ s^ bk.%] : Yeah .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : And , eh , t he ot her m ode of operat ion [ pause] which
should be appropriat e , for exam ple , for t his m eet ing room exam ple ,
[ pause] uh [ pause] doesn’t require any [ disfm arker] any access point ,
m n021 [ s] : and in t his second case , com m unicat ion happens [ pause]
f eh um from one com put er t o t he ot her at t he link ly lay er .
m n021 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ?
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : So , if I want t o connect [ pause] t o uh , let ’s say ,
Miguel ’s , [ pause] uh Michael ’s , uh I [ disfm arker] I will send him
[ pause] a packet ,

m n021 [ s] : and he will receive it , and t hat ’s it .
m n021 [ s] : OK , we can build on t op of t his [ pause] som e [ pause] uh
rout ing algorit hm ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : som e ad − hoc rout ing algorit hm ,
m n021 [ s] : but t his is out of t he scope of t he [ disfm arker] of t he
st andard .
m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : and Miguel , should [ disfm arker] I should ask you one
quest ion .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s] : And uh uh in version one and t wo you [ disfm arker] you
have different t echnologies .
m n082 [ s] : You know , frequency hopping , uh t wo m odes and
[ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and also infrared .
m n021 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ qy ^ rt ] : Does it st ill apply for [ disfm arker] for t he uh [ pause]
elev en − B ?
m n021 [ s^ 2.%−−] : For t he [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ ar] : no .
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : Elev en − B is only for [ disfm arker] for uh radio
m n021 [ s] : and it ’s only for uh [ pause] direct sequences spread
spect rum .
m n082 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , DSS .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s] : But , in fact , t here is an ongoing new v ersion , I t hink it ’s
c [ pause] v ersion − A ,
m n021 [ s] : but it is not uh com m ercially available
m n021 [ s^ e] : which w will use [ pause] uh ort hogonal frequency
div ision m ult iplexing
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s] : and will get probably t went y − five m egabit s per second .
m n021 [ fh|s] : eh [ pause] but , again , t he will m ove t o five gigahert z ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : uh fiv e point fiv e gigahert z ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : eh [ pause] gigahert z , [ pause] uh [ pause] area of a

m n021 [ s.%−−] : But now , uh current devices [ pause] are split at
[ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : You know , t hat t he old [ disfm arker] [ pause] t he old
wav eLAN are nine hundred m egahert z [ pause] version
m n021 [ s] : and t he new ones are t he [ disfm arker] t he eleven

m n082 [ s^ 2] : Megahert z ,
m n082 [ b] : yeah .

m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ s.%−] : Howev er , [ pause] uh [ pause] som e old uh waveLANs
are also , but not t he older ones [ disfm arker] [ pause] t he oldest ones
, [ pause] are also uh t wo point four m
m n021 [ s^ m ^ na] : eh gigahert z . [ pause] S
m n082 [ s^ 2] : Uh , gigahert z .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s] : In t he RSM band .
m n021 [ %−] : S
m n021 [ s.%−−] : And t he good t hing is t hat now , [ pause] especially
wit h t he new version , [ pause] all y ou [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s] : y ou ca y ou [ disfm arker] you are [ disfm arker] you st art t o
see [ pause] uh com pat ible product s in t he m arket .
m n021 [ s^ df] : Because eh [ disfm arker] [ pause] m aybe because it ’s
t he , let ’s say , second version ,
m n021 [ s^ df^ e] : but also because [ pause] I t hink it ’s t he only way
[ pause] for t his indust ry t o t ake off .
m n021 [ s^ df] : because [ pause] uh [ pause] previous versions , if you
[ pause] buy , let ’s say , waveLAN , [ pause] you are t ied t o waveLAN
[ pause] al t he rest of your life .
m n021 [ s] : But now y ou can [ disfm arker] [ pause] you can have
int eroperable product s [ pause] from several vendors ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : which is , I t hink , [ pause] what , [ pause] in t he past ,
[ com m ent ] will [ pause] power t he et hernet uh revolut ion
m n021 [ s] : You can buy [ pause] any [ disfm arker] any com pat ible

m n021 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and y ou know it will work wit h t he ot her
brand .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s] : And one addit ional quest ion from m yself ,
m n082 [ s] : but m aybe also short ,
m n082 [ s^ df] : because t im e it running fast .
m n082 [ s] : Uh , I have heard t hat uh wireless LAN and Bluet oot h will
have som e problem s
m n082 [ s^ e] : uh t hat t hey influence each ot her .
m n021 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : In front ?
m n082 [ qy ] : Do y ou have addit ional inform at ion about t his t opic ?
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n021 [ h] : Mm m .
m n021 [ %−−] : You know ,
m n021 [ s.%−−] : in t he beginning , uh what w [ pause] t he [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s] : I t hink t hat [ pause] t o put t hings in perspect ive , [ pause]
what we [ pause] need t o know is [ pause] what Bluet oot h is and what
[ pause] Bluet oot h is for .
m n021 [ s] : And uh Bluet oot h is m ainly for [ pause] cut t ing [ pause] t his
cable .

m n021 [ s] : You know , t he ot her day I was joking about [ pause] t hat
our wireless m icrophones [ pause] were not , in fact , [ pause] wireless
m n021 [ s] : because it had t his wire ,
m n021 [ s] : So , t he point is [ pause] t hat eh Bluet oot h is m ainly a
t echnology [ pause] for cut t ing t hese kind of cables .
m n021 [ s] : You know , sh oh short [ disfm arker] short dist ance cables ,
m n082 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , t hat ’s right .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s.%−−] : uh , carrying usually [ pause] really s uh , sh
[ disfm arker] nnn ,
m n021 [ fh] : nnn
m n021 [ s^ e] : slow signals ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : or [ pause] let ’s say , boys and som et hing like t his .
m n082 [ fg|s] : Yeah , but nevert heless , y ou have t he range of t en
m et ers , or of one hundred m et ers .
m n021 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ aap|s.%−−] : Yeah , but y ou know , uh in fact
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ fh|s] : uh [ pause] t he init ial v ersion [ pause] had only t he
[ disfm arker] t he range of t en m et ers ,
m n021 [ s:s|qh^ cs] : and I guess t hat som ebody at [ pause] a cert ain
m eet ing [ pause] said " OK , why don’t we have [ pause] a l an ext ended

m n021 [ s:s^ df] : so we could [ pause] re − use t he sam e t echnology for

m n021 [ s:s^ e] : different [ pause] t han t he original ones . "
m n021 [ s] : So , em , uh , I have t he feeling t hat t his is [ disfm arker]
[ pause] u t his is what is uh [ pause] int roducing som e confor confusion
[ pause] in t he [ disfm arker] [ pause] in t he Bluet oot h
m n021 [ s] : eh [ disfm arker] [ pause] or in t he way people is
[ disfm arker] is looking at Bluet oot h
m n021 [ s^ df] : because t hey can say " OK , hundred m et ers is
[ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] [ pause] is [ pause] an accept able dist ance
,
m n021 [ s] : let ’s say , for com m unicat ing inside a building , inside a
[ disfm arker] a sm all office .
m n021 [ s] : So , [ pause] uh som e people , I t hink , is being t em pt ed t o
[ pause] t hink t hat Bluet oot h could [ pause] provide t hem [ pause] uh ,
som e kind of local connect ivit y ,
m n021 [ s] : but [ pause] uh for [ disfm arker] for dat a for com put ing
[ pause] uses .
m n021 [ s.%−−] : Eh , however , I t hink t hat t he [ disfm arker] t hat t he
[ disfm arker] [ pause] When you have t ried [ pause] uh [ pause] current
eh st andard eh working devices , [ pause] you [ disfm arker] you
[ disfm arker]

m n021 [ s] : working at [ disfm arker] at eleven m egabit s per second ,
y ou cannot [ disfm arker] [ pause] y ou cannot swit ch t o anot her t hing ,
t o anot her slower t hing .
m n021 [ s] : But uh [ pause] even when t hey are using t he sam e
[ disfm arker] t he sam e uh , um [ pause] area of a s a spect rum ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : because Bluet oot h is also int ended t o work in t wo
point four uh gigabit s ,
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s] : eh t he t echnologies are different ,
m n021 [ s] : y ou know eh Bluet oot h [ pause] eh is using a frequency
hopping sy st em
m n021 [ fh] : and uh
m n021 [ fh] : m m m
m n021 [ s] : bot h uh dialing sequence and frequency hopping , [ pause]
spread t he spect rum t echniques , [ pause] are also int ended [ pause]
t o provide uh int erference l uh less , uh [ pause] dat a t ransm ission .
m n021 [ s] : So , t he idea is t hat [ pause] t hese [ pause] t wo t echniques
[ pause] are int ended not t o int erfere [ pause] wit h any ot her t hing .
m n021 [ s] : So , [ pause] even when I hav en’t t ried , [ pause] and I
cannot t ell y ou for sure , [ pause] I t hink t hat [ pause] t he only problem
[ pause] one net work will encount er [ pause] uh in t he presence of t he
ot her [ pause] is a lit t le bit [ pause] of m ore noise .
m n021 [ s^ bd] : And t his will produce a lit t le bit [ pause] less
t hroughput ,
m n021 [ s^ df] : but not hing m ore .
m n021 [ s] : I don’t expect any [ disfm arker] any [ pause] m ore problem .
m n021 [ s.%−−] : ev en [ pause] t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he own
Bluet oot h specificat ion [ pause] is also
m n021 [ fh] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n021 [ s.%−−] : assum ing t hat anot her Bluet oot h [ pause] or several
Bluet oot h [ pause] net works [ pause] c will be [ disfm arker] could be
[ pause] in t he sam e area of space
m n021 [ s] : and t hey are using t he sam e [ pause] hopping t echnology ,
frequency hopping t echnology .
m n021 [ s] : But again , [ pause] t his t echnology [ pause] is uh t rying t o
av oid [ pause] t he ot her net works by choosing different hopping
pat t erns .
m n021 [ s] : So [ pause] uh [ pause] if several Bluet oot h net works can
[ disfm arker] can uh coexist wit hout a problem , [ pause] I don’t see any
problem will [ disfm arker] will happen if [ disfm arker] if we [ pause] want
t o [ disfm arker] t o m ake coexist [ pause] one uh Bluet oot h wit h anot her
wireless uh local area net work t echnology .
m n082 [ s^ ba|qy^ d^ f] : Well t hat ’s a good news , OK ?
m n021 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . I t hink so .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : But anyway , [ vocalsound] um based on your uh uh
[ pause] init ial scenario I believe because Bluet oot h is on one chip ,

m n021 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s] : like you have now your UCB buss or what ever connect ivit y ,
y ou will have your Bluet oot h connect ivit y .
m n021 [ s] : Five bucks .
m n082 [ s.%−] : And t hat m eans your m ouse , and [ disfm arker] and
[ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ e] : Fiv e bucks chip .
m n082 [ s^ bk^ rt |s] : Yeah , and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and
what ev er kind of [ disfm arker] of eh t hings connect ed t o your lapt op
and also y our m icrophone and what ev er y ou will [ disfm arker] will have ,
is Bluet oot h − based .
m n021 [ b] : Hm m − hm m − hm m .
m n082 [ s^ f|s^ bsc] : Yeah , or will be Bluet oot h − based .
m n021 [ s^ bc] : Will be .
m n082 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , and t his is [ disfm arker] t his is eh wit hin m aybe
an uh wireless LAN .
m n021 [ s^ r] : Will be .
m n082 [ s.%−] : So , despit e t he fact t hat t hey are considered for
different scenarios t hey are st ill
m n021 [ s] : In fact [ disfm arker] in fact Bluet oot h is also designed
m n082 [ s^ e] : wit hin one [ disfm arker] one area .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ e] : t o be com pat ible wit h exist ing [ pause] digit al European
cordless t elephones .
m n021 [ s] : So , hopefully , [ pause] we will be able [ pause] t o use
som e of [ pause] our old devices [ pause] or m aybe our [ disfm arker] our
cordless phone base st at ion at hom e , [ pause] wit h a com put er . S
m n021 [ s] : S [ pause] So I t hink som e really nice applicat ions will
[ disfm arker] will appear .
m n082 [ s^ bk|s^ j] : OK we ’ll when I [ disfm arker] I will have som e
problem s in t he fut ure wit h m y l [ pause] wireless LAN and Bluet oot h
connect ivit y ,
m n082 [ s^ cc^ j] : I will com e t o y ou ,
m n082 [ s^ j|qy^ d^ f^ g] : you will solve it OK ?
m n021 [ s^ na] : I ’ll t ry t o .
m n082 [ s^ bk|s^ co^ t c] : OK , please go on .
m n021 [ s] : So , [ pause] let m e [ disfm arker] let m e just uh finish , you
know .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s] : Uh [ pause] well , [ pause] t his is som et hing I , m ore or less
, [ pause] I t old y ou .
m n021 [ fh|s.%−−] : and eh [ pause] you know , t he point , or
[ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker]

m n021 [ s] : what [ disfm arker] [ pause] t he [ disfm arker] t he spark of
[ disfm arker] of m y [ disfm arker] [ pause] of m y work here , or at least ,
of what I [ pause] was proposing t o work here , [ pause] is [ pause] t he
fact t hat [ pause] t hese t wo m odel uh t wo m odes of operat ion , I was
t elling y ou here [ disfm arker] [ pause] t hat you have t o choose at t he
driv er level [ pause] if your net work adapt or [ pause] is working in an
[ pause] access point − based environm ent or in ad ho [ pause] in an
[ pause] ad − hoc env ironm ent . [ pause] I see t his as a [ disfm arker] as
a lim it at ion
m n021 [ s^ df] : because I t hink t hat [ pause] uh when you have t o
choose am ong t wo opt ions , well , m m m , [ pause] m aybe you are
[ pause] saying " no " t o som e of t he benefit s t he ot her opt ion ,
[ pause] different t han t he one y ou are choosing , [ pause] could
prov ide you .
m n021 [ s.%−−] : And I envision an [ disfm arker] an [ disfm arker] an m
[ pause] [ pause] an escenario [ pause] where [ pause] eh [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ fa] : Oops !
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Well , yeah .
m n021 [ s^ co^ t 1] : Let ’s go .
m n021 [ s] : where we can hav e [ pause] a kind of uh dual m ode uh
wireless net work adapt or
m n021 [ s] : So [ pause] if we are not able [ pause] t o reach any access
point [ pause] but we are able t o reach anot her net work [ pause] node
, [ pause] well , [ pause] m aybe t his [ pause] net work node [ pause]
could do [ pause] m e t he favor [ pause] t o reach or t o forward m y
packet s t o t he access point .
m n021 [ s] : So [ pause] t he m ain idea , t he driving force here , [ pause]
is [ pause] t o uh [ pause] t ry t o obt ain [ pause] uh , let ’s say , hybrid
[ pause] m ode
m n021 [ s] : which allows [ pause] an adapt or t o work eit her in t he
access point or in t he [ disfm arker] [ pause] eh [ pause] in t he ad − hoc
m ode [ pause] in a seam less way .
m n021 [ s.%−−] : and t o include in every single node driver ,
m n021 [ s] : t his forwarding or helper [ pause] uh forwarding [ pause]
m echanism [ pause] t hat [ pause] will allow [ pause] t o ext end t he
wireless coverage [ pause] wit hout a need of buying [ pause] a lot of
access point s
m n021 [ s^ e|qy^ d^ f^ g] : and put t ing even an access point inside t he
rest room . OK ?
m n021 [ s] : Of course [ pause] t his idea m m m , [ pause] can sound
[ pause] p can sound a lit t le bit [ pause] not very appealing for t he
m anufact urers ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : at least for t he m anufact urers of access point
m n021 [ s^ df] : because well , t hey probably are very happy of selling a
lot of t hem .
m n082 [ s^ cs] : But m aybe for cars .

m n082 [ s^ e] : Yeah , if your car is t he infrast ruct ure , for inst ance .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n082 [ b] : Yeah .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s] : So , [ pause] t his is [ pause] t he m I t hink t his is near t he
end , t his is t he last [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ fh] : So
m n021 [ qh] : One possible ext ension of t he sam e idea [ pause] and
som et hing uh I ’ve been t hinking for awhile , [ pause] is t he idea t hat ,
well , why can’t [ pause] do [ pause] we [ com m ent ] ext end t his sam e
concept t o cell array syst em s ?
m n021 [ qh] : Why [ pause] can’t we , [ pause] for exam ple , t hink about
[ pause] som e m m m , [ pause] new [ pause] m echanism s t hat users
could get , [ pause] uh [ pause] connect iv it y by m eans of ot her users ,
[ pause] and no direct ly t o t he base st at ion ,
m n021 [ qh] : or , [ pause] when we have [ pause] sev eral t echnologies
[ pause] uh in [ disfm arker] [ pause] overlapped in a cert ain area ,
[ pause] why can’t we use [ pause] t he closest and t he cheapest ,
m ay be , t echnology ,
m n021 [ s^ e] : or m aybe [ pause] t he less [ pause] power [ pause]
consum pt ion t echnology , [ pause] wit hout t he user t o worry about if
he is now [ pause] using t his or [ pause] t he ot her t echnology .
m n021 [ qh] : And [ pause] on t he ot her hand , [ pause] what are t he
billing [ pause] im plicat ions of t his behav ior ?
m n021 [ s^ df] : Because [ pause] it is clear t hat , well , [ pause] when I
’m [ pause] only [ pause] uh , t alking t o t he [ disfm arker] t o t he base
st at ion of m y provider , well [ pause] billing is [ pause] m ore or less
st raight forward ,
m n021 [ qh] : but [ pause] what happens [ pause] if I ’m working [ pause]
uh , let ’s say , uh across a m all , [ pause] and [ pause] at a given
m om ent I ’m using [ pause] t he sm all [ pause] base st at ion of a
cordless phone [ pause] t hat is inside t he shop I ’m at t he window of ?
m n021 [ s] : Well in t his case , I ’m using [ pause] a resource [ pause]
which is not owned by m y provider .
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : I ’m using , [ pause] a [ disfm arker] let ’s say , a privat e
propert y .
m n021 [ s] : Maybe I have t o pay [ pause] t o t his privat e propert y ,
m n021 [ s] : or m ay be m y carrier [ pause] will have t o pay or t o refund
som e m oney t o t his guy .
m n021 [ s^ df] : You know [ pause] t his som et hing , uh [ pause] I ’m
put t ing on t he t able
m n021 [ s^ bd] : I ’m not sure about , [ pause] uh [ pause] if t his can be
really of int erest or not
m n021 [ s] : but , [ pause] it ’s an idea ,
m n021 [ s] : and I ’ll be happy t o discuss it wit h y ou .

m n021 [ s^ t ^ t c] : And I uh [ disfm arker] I t hink [ pause] m y present at ion
is ov er ,
m n021 [ fh] : So .
m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ s^ ft ] : m any t hanks Miguel .
m n082 [ qo^ rt ] : Are t here any quest ions ?
m n021 [ s^ fw] : Oh , you are [ pause] welcom e .
m n082 [ s^ cs] : May be we have also t he t im e t o discuss wit h Miguel off

m n082 [ s] : Maybe one last quest ion from m y side
m n082 [ s^ df] : because I bring it up , [ pause] uh concerning t he

m n021 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n082 [ s] : It ’s going in a quit e different direct ion as [ disfm arker] as
[ disfm arker] as [ disfm arker] as t he t radit ional t hings discussed in t he
ITF
m n082 [ s] : and I current ly do not have any idea whet her act ive rout ing
is really a t opic uh , wit hin t he I T
m n082 [ qr] : Do y ou have cert ain kind of experience or do you know
cert ain act ivit ies uh , in t hat area ?
m n021 [ h|s^ nd] : Nnn , no t o bot h q [ pause] t o bot h quest ions .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s^ rt ] : I don’t have previous experience
m n021 [ s] : I don’t eh know if [ disfm arker] uh where it will [ disfm arker]
[ pause] it would fix .
m n021 [ s] : Howev er , [ pause] eh you know I ’m just doing [ pause] t his
present at ion
m n021 [ fh|s] : uh [ pause] som e [ pause] som ehow a review [ pause] of
m y prev ious work .
m n082 [ s|s^ bk] : I know , yeah .
m n021 [ s.%−−] : So eh t his eh doesn’t m ean t hat [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m probably [ pause] get t ing involved a
lit t le bit m ore in t his act ive rout ing t hing .
m n082 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n021 [ fh|s] : So uh [ pause] I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] m ay be I will
be able t o [ disfm arker] hopefully I will be able t o [ disfm arker] t o give
y ou a bet t er answer in t he fut ure .
m n082 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n082 [ s^ ft ] : One m ore t im e , m any t hanks Miguel .
m n082 [ fg] : So .
m n021 [ s^ ft ] : Oh , t han t hanks , Michael , for your com put er .
m n035 [ s^ fw] : No problem .
m n082 [ s] : So I will deploy a lit t le bit inform at ion here from t he uh
project proposal .

m n021 [ qy ^ t 3] : Should I power off it ?
m n035 [ s^ co^ t 3] : Um , just log out .
m n021 [ s^ bk^ t 3] : OK .
m n035 [ fg|s^ ar^ t 3] : Uh . No .
m n035 [ s^ co^ t 3] : Log out .
m n021 [ s^ bk^ t 3|s^ fa^ t 3] : Oh , OK , sorry , sorry .
m n082 [ s.%−−] : So I have only
m n082 [ s] : four .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n082 [ s] : Jordi is [ pause] only a short period of t im e here ,
m n021 [ %−] : W
m n021 [ s.%−] : which is i which is proper [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s] : so he will get t he [ pause] colored one .
m n021 [ s] : Michael
m n040 [ s^ ft ] : Ah , t hank you [ disfm arker] t hank you very m uch .
m n035 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n021 [ s^ r] : Michael ,
m n082 [ s^ cs.%−−] : and t ake a look t o [ disfm arker]
m n021 [ s^ ba] : which is t he proper answer ?
m n082 [ fh] : uh
m n035 [ s^ na] : That ’s t he proper answer .
m n021 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Th − t his one ?
m n035 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n082 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n021 [ s^ ft ] : Thank you .
m n082 [ s] : Kill t he com put er .
m n082 [ h|s^ t c] : Uh , So I st art ed uh , for [ disfm arker] for advert ising
t he project proposal here t o provide a few slides
m n082 [ s] : I t hink , first of all , Wilbert , is not here ,
m n082 [ s] : second um , t he [ pause] um link here [ pause] was uh
enabling UMTS services and applicat ion ,
m n082 [ s] : uh , I assum e [ nonvocalsound] was not read [ pause]
y est erday night .
m n082 [ s^ cs] : So [ pause] I suggest we go roughly t o t he slides here
m n082 [ fh] : and um
m n082 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he problem is t hat , in principle , we have
different scopes .
m n082 [ s] : And m ot ivat ion of t he project proposal from m y point of
v iew is t hat we will have t he um Wireless access net works for t he next
generat ion will be m ore flexible .
m n082 [ s] : There ’s a @ @ for uh current [ disfm arker] uh uh uh for
[ disfm arker] for fast [ pause] changes wit hin t his net work .

m n082 [ s] : And t hat m eans , if you go t o slide num ber t hree ,
[ nonv ocalsound] t hat [ pause] we [ pause] have [ pause] um [ pause]
t he possibilit y t o [ disfm arker] t o um [ pause] having norm al feat ures in
t he m obile access net work ,
m n082 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ fh] : and [ pause] um
m n082 [ s] : and [ pause] um [ pause] also based on t hat it belongs
norm ally t o one single provider dom ain , t hat it is possible t o
[ disfm arker] t o uh use novel t hings
m n082 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and new prot ocols and
new t echnologies wit hin t his net work .
m n082 [ s] : On t he ot her hand , in t he int ernet backbone , uh [ pause]
we [ disfm arker] it is i im possible
m n082 [ s] : and we see it on sev eral exam ples
m n082 [ s^ e] : like t his , MPLS ,
m n082 [ s] : t here ’s qualit y of service support , and m ult icast
m n082 [ s^ e] : and all t his kind of t hing ,
m n082 [ s] : t hat , based on t he success of t he int ernet backbone , it
’s becom e uh [ pause] very unflexible , t o p uh fo for t he provision of
t hese t hings .
m n082 [ s] : So , if [ pause] we are going t o offer building blocks , and
prov ide nov el solut ions for t he nex t generat ion of wireless access
net works , t aking int o account , [ pause] wit hout m odifying [ pause] t he
end − t o − end scope , t hen I t hink it ’s really beneficial work ,
m n082 [ s^ e] : also for t he use of int eract iv e m ult im edia applicat ion ,
m n082 [ s] : so [ pause] as it is described in t he uh [ pause] project
proposal .
m n082 [ s] : Um [ pause] t he point is t hat um [ pause] t o st art [ pause]
wit h um [ pause] a bigger clust er of co uh [ pause] of pot ent ial part ners
t o do t his really really really big work ,
m n082 [ s^ e] : seem s not t o be feasible in t he next t im e .
m n082 [ s^ df.%−−] : because if you have set t led everyt hing , and
discussed ev ery t hing and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and
[ disfm arker] and uh [ disfm arker] wit hout any m oney in t he background
, and a lot of m oney in t he background ,
m n082 [ s] : t hat is not uh feasible from m y point of view .
m n082 [ s^ df] : Nevert heless , I discussed , wit h a lot of part ners ,
t hese t hings .
m n082 [ s] : And t oday , [ pause] uh Michael and m e , we were on t he
UCB t o discuss wit h a guy who is a professor who is probably
int erest ed in t he applicat ion st uff .
m n082 [ s] : They are going in t hat direct ion .
m n082 [ s] : They have a sm all project funded by NSA [ disfm arker]
m n082 [ s^ bsc] : NSF ,
m n082 [ s^ e] : um , f for t his " int elligent classroom " , is a lit t le bit
ex aggerat ed , I believe ,

m n082 [ s] : but going in t hat direct ion .
m n082 [ s] : So t here are a lot of int erest ,
m n082 [ s] : but wit hout really [ pause] hard m oney in t he background ,
it is very hard t o com e t o t he init ial st eps .
m n082 [ s] : And uh Juan Peire , one of t he uh m em bers of t his NSA
group has [ pause] uh [ pause] ident ified a cert ain kind of s st art
m oney , I would like t o say .
m n082 [ s^ cs] : So m aybe if you st art wit h a sm all clust er of um t he
const raint s of t his funding ,
m n082 [ s] : and t hat m eans uh six universit ies and [ disfm arker] and
inst it ut ions
m n082 [ s^ e] : uh , t hree in USA and t hree in Europe .
m n082 [ s] : and of course , t hey are uh including t he NSA group
m n082 [ s] : and m ay be t hat seem s t o be v ery reasonably , for m e .
m n082 [ s^ cs] : But t hen we have t o align t he project proposal in t hat
sense .
m n082 [ s^ df] : Because t hen we cannot do [ disfm arker] do anyt hing
as it is described in t he [ disfm arker] in t he bigger scope .
m n082 [ s] : So t he point is [ pause] um [ pause] t o reduce t he overall
pict ure , which I described in a few words , t o t he fact t hat we have
really som e work packages where we can focus on it ,
m n082 [ s^ e] : st ill fit t ing int o t he big pict ure .
m n082 [ s^ f] : Yeah ?
m n082 [ s] : And so t hat will be t he t ask of t he next weeks .
m n082 [ fh] : And [ pause] uh
m n082 [ s] : I [ pause] hope t hat ev ery body is doing his hom ework
concerning @ @ for inst ance
m n082 [ s^ cs] : uh alt ernat ive t o t he int elligent classroom m aybe t hat
we [ pause] h can st art here only wit h t he N S A group
m n082 [ s^ e] : wit hin t his big pict ure
m n082 [ s^ e] : um [ pause] wit h som e work
m n082 [ s^ e] : t hat we put t he pieces t oget her .
m n082 [ s^ df] : Because I believ e m any are very flexible here
m n082 [ s] : account ing also t he [ pause] fut ure − com ing uh [ pause]
joining people of t he NSA group , t o do som e work here .
m n082 [ s] : And if [ pause] we are st art ing wit h a very very very sm all
clust er wit h a com m on act ivit y have m aybe som e st art ing funding for
bigger uh [ pause] radius of t he [ disfm arker] of t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t he uh [ pause] project proposal , wit h t he m ind t hat
m ay be at t he final st age it will becom ing a European proposal wit h t his
uh t he [ disfm arker] t he whole funding .
m n082 [ s] : That ’s uh [ pause] m y point , and m y pict ure I have in m ind
.
m n082 [ s^ rt ] : And I will go definit ely back t o [ pause] Germ any t he
t ent h of Decem ber .
m n082 [ s] : That is fixed now .

m n082 [ s] : And I hope we can use t hese rem aining weeks [ pause] t o
have really progress in [ disfm arker] uh for t he proposal in t hat sense

m n082 [ s] : There is no so m uch different .
m n082 [ fh|s] : Um . You always have t he SGSN and UMTS ,
m n082 [ s] : t hey are called t hree − GSGSN .
m n082 [ s] : And you have t he prot ocol st ack
m n082 [ s] : um in [ disfm arker] on t he slide num ber five , t o see what
uh is going on .
m n082 [ s^ e] : And you see t he difference .

have t wo − IP layer funct ionalit y and [ disfm arker] and all t hose t hings .

m n082 [ s] : And y ou have t he [ pause] GPS t unnel p uh prot ocol G T P
bet ween t he G and t he S and t he GTSN .

m n082 [ s] : So uh I believe t hey are very very difficult prot ocols st uck
bet ween t he uh [ disfm arker] bet ween t he um um involved nodes ,
m n082 [ s] : and [ pause] m aking it necessary , in principle , t o deal wit h
our four building blocks in um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] yeah , I believ e
, in a difficult way ,
m n082 [ s] : if , uh , we have in m ind qualit y of service rout ing , and
[ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] uh qualit uh m obilit y aspect s and
[ disfm arker] and all t his kinds of t hings for [ pause] I P layer
funct ionalit y .
m n082 [ s] : So t hat ’s , in principle , uh an overview , of t he prot ocol
st ack
m n082 [ s^ e] : and t he involved nodes ,
m n082 [ s] : and I will provide m ore and m ore inform at ion
m n082 [ s] : but um eh I have t o also figure out everyt hing from t he
scrat ch .
m n082 [ s] : I am not a t ot al expert for [ disfm arker] for t he fut ure
[ pause] wireless net works .
