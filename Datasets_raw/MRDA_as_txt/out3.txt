m n015 [ s^ rt ^ t ] : and we also have a l lit t le bit on t he int erface ,
m n015 [ s^ e^ rt ^ t ] : M − t hree − L enhancem ent ,
m n015 [ fh|s] : and t hen um t hat was it , I t hink .
m e003 [ s] : So , what I did for t his [ disfm arker] t his is [ disfm arker] uh ,
a pedagogical belief − net
m e003 [ s^ df] : because I was [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I t ook
[ disfm arker] I t ried t o concept ually do what you were t alking about wit h
t he nodes t hat y ou could expand out [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s.%−−] : so what I did was I t ook [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : I m ade t hese dum m y nodes called Traject or − In and
Traject or − Out t hat would isolat e t he t hings relat ed t o t he t raject or .
m e010 [ b] : Yep .
m e003 [ s] : And t hen t here were t he t hings wit h t he source and t he
pat h and t he goal .
m e010 [ b] : Yep .
m e003 [ s] : And I separat ed t hem out .

m e003 [ s] : And t hen I um did sim ilar t hings for our [ disfm arker] our
net t o [ disfm arker] uh wit h t he cont ex t and t he discourse and what not
,
m e003 [ fh|s] : um , so we could sort of isolat e t hem or what ever in
t erm s of t he [ disfm arker] t he t op layer .
m e010 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s] : And t hen t he bot t om layer is just t he Mode .
m e003 [ fh] : So .
m e010 [ s^ co.%−−] : So , let ’s [ disfm arker] let ’s [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ no] : Yeah , I don’t underst and it .
m e010 [ s^ co.%−−] : Let ’s go [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ co] : Slide all t he way up so we see what t he p t he p very
bot t om looks like ,
m e010 [ qy ^ rt ] : or is t hat it ?
m e003 [ s^ aa|s.%−] : Yeah , t here ’s just one m ore node and it says "
Mode " which is t he decision bet ween t he [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK , great .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Alright .
m e010 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ rt ] : So basically all I did was I t ook t he last [ pause] belief −
net
m e010 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s] : and I grouped t hings according t o what [ disfm arker] how I
t hought t hey would fit in t o uh im age schem as t hat would be relat ed .
m e003 [ s] : And t he t wo t hat I cam e up wit h were Traject or − landm ark
and t hen Source − pat h − goal as init ial ones .
m e010 [ b] : Yep .
m e010 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s] : And t hen I said well , uh t he t raject or would be t he person
in t his case probably .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right ,
m e010 [ s^ aa] : yep .
m e003 [ h|s] : Um , you know , we have [ disfm arker] we have t he
concept of what t heir int ent ion was , whet her t hey were t rying t o t our
or do business or what ever ,
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e003 [ s] : or t hey were hurried .
m e003 [ s] : That ’s kind of relat ed t o t hat .
m e003 [ fh|s.%−−] : And t hen um in t erm s of t he source , t he t hings
[ disfm arker] uh t he only t hings t hat we had on t here I believe were
whet her [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ bc] : Oh act ually , I kind of , [ disfm arker] I m ight have added
t hese cuz I don’t t hink we t alked t oo m uch about t he source in t he old
one

m e003 [ fh|s.%−−] : but uh whet her t he [ disfm arker] where I ’m current ly
at is a landm ark m ight have a bearing on whet her [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s^ bc] : or t he " landm ark − iness " of where I ’m current ly at .
m e003 [ s] : And " usefulness " is basi basically m eans is t hat an
inst it ut ional facilit y like a t own hall or som et hing like t hat t hat ’s not
[ disfm arker] som et hing t hat you ’d v isit for t ourist ’s [ disfm arker]
t ourism ’s sake or what ever .
m e003 [ s] : " Travel const raint s " would be som et hing like you know ,
m ay be t hey said t hey can [ disfm arker] t hey only wanna t ake a bus or
som et hing like t hat ,
m e003 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e003 [ s] : And t hen t hose are som ewhat relat ed t o t he pat h ,
m e010 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s^ e] : so t hat would det erm ine whet her we ’d [ disfm arker]
could t ake [ disfm arker] we would be t elling t hem t o go t o t he bus st op
or v ersus walking t here direct ly .
m e003 [ fh|s] : Um , " Goal " .
m e003 [ s] : Sim ilar t hings as t he source ex cept t hey also added
whet her t he ent it y was closed
m e003 [ s] : and whet her t hey have som ehow m arked t hat is was t he
final dest inat ion .
m e003 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um , and t hen if you go up ,
m e003 [ s] : Robert ,
m e003 [ fh|s] : Yeah , so [ disfm arker] um , in t erm s of Cont ext , what we
had current ly said was whet her t hey were a businessm an or a t ourist
of som e ot her person .
m e003 [ fh|s] : Um , Discourse was relat ed t o whet her t hey had asked
about open hours
m e003 [ s] : or whet her t hey asked about where t he ent rance was or
t he adm ission fee , or som et hing along t hose lines .
m e010 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ fh|s^ rt ] : Uh , Prosody I don’t really [ disfm arker] I ’m not really
sure what prosody m eans , in t his cont ext ,
m e003 [ s] : so I just m ade up you know whet her [ disfm arker] whet her
what t hey say is [ disfm arker] or h how t hey say it is [ disfm arker] is t hat
.
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right , OK .
m e003 [ fh|s] : Um , t he Parse would be what verb t hey chose ,
m e003 [ s] : and t hen m aybe how t hey m odified it , in t he sense of
whet her t hey said " I need t o get t here quickly " or what ev er .
m e010 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ fh|s] : And um , in t erm s of World Knowledge , t his would just
basically be like opening and closing t im es of t hings , t he t im e of day it
is , and what not .
m n015 [ qw] : What ’s " t ourbook " ?

m e003 [ s^ m .%−−] : Tourbook ?
m e003 [ s] : That would be , I don’t know , t he " landm ark − iness " of
t hings ,
m n015 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s^ e] : whet her it ’s in t he t ourbook or not .
m e010 [ h] : Ch − ch − ch − ch .
m e010 [ s^ t c] : Now .
m e010 [ s] : Alright , so I underst and what ’s [ disfm arker] what you got
.
m e010 [ s^ no] : I don’t yet underst and [ pause] how you would use it .
m e010 [ s] : So let m e see if I can ask
m e010 [ %−] : a s
m e003 [ s] : Well , t his is not a working Bay es − net .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ arp] : No , I underst and t hat ,
m e010 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker] but um
m e010 [ qw.%−−] : So , what [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ co] : Let ’s slide back up again
m e010 [ %−−] : and see [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : st art at t he [ disfm arker] at t he bot t om
m e010 [ %−−] : and
m e010 [ b] : Oop − bo − doop − boop − boop .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ fg|s^ cs.%−−] : So , you could im agine
m e010 [ fh|s^ co] : w Uh , go ahead , you were about t o go up t here
and point t o som et hing .
m e003 [ s^ nd.%−−] : Well I [ disfm arker] OK , I just [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ co] : Say what you were gonna say .
m e010 [ s^ co] : Good , do it !
m e010 [ s^ co] : No no ,
m e003 [ s^ aa] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ co^ r] : go do it .
m e003 [ s^ nd.%−] : Uh [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I ’d [ disfm arker] No , I
was gonna wait unt il [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e010 [ fg|s] : So , so if you [ disfm arker] if we m ade [ disfm arker] if we
want ed t o m ake it int o a [ disfm arker] a real uh Bayes − net ,
m e010 [ s^ e.%−−] : t hat is , you know , wit h fill [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : you know , act ually f uh , fill it @ @ in , t hen uh
[ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ bu] : So we ’d have t o get rid of t his and connect t hese
t hings direct ly t o t he Mode .
m e010 [ s^ ng.%−−] : Well , I don’t [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : That ’s an issue .
m e010 [ fh] : So , um [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ df] : Cuz I don’t underst and how it would work ot herwise .

m e010 [ s] : Well , here ’s t he problem .
m e010 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and uh [ disfm arker] Bhaskara and I was
t alking about t his a lit t le earlier t oday [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ cs] : is , if we just do t his , we could wind up wit h a huge uh
, com binat oric input t o t he Mode t hing .
m e010 [ fh] : And uh [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ na] : Well I [ disfm arker] oh yeah , I unders I underst and t hat
,
m e003 [ s] : I just [ disfm arker] uh it ’s hard for m e t o im agine how he
could get around t hat .
m e010 [ s] : Well , i But t hat ’s what we hav e t o do .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ fg] : OK , so , so ,
m e010 [ fh] : uh .
m e010 [ s] : There [ disfm arker] t here are a variet y of ways of doing it .
m e010 [ fh|s^ co^ t ] : Uh . Let m e just m ent ion som et hing t hat I don’t
want t o pursue t oday
m e010 [ s^ e] : which is t here are t echnical ways of doing it ,
m e010 [ s] : uh I I slipped a paper t o Bhaskara and [ disfm arker] about
Noisy − OR ’s and Noisy − MAXes
m e010 [ fh] : and
m e010 [ s] : t here ’re ways t o uh sort of back off on t he purit y of your
Bay es − net − edness .
m e003 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ fh|s.%−−] : Uh , so . If you co y ou could im a and I
m e010 [ s^ no] : now I don’t know t hat any of t hose act ually apply in
t his case ,
m e010 [ s] : but t here is som e t echnology y ou could t ry t o apply .
m e003 [ s^ bu.%−] : So it ’s possible t hat we could do som et hing like a
sum m ary node of som e sort t hat [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ fh] : And , um
m e010 [ fh] : So .
m e003 [ s^ bu.%−−] : So in t hat case , t he sum we ’d have [ disfm arker]
we [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : I m ean , t hese wouldn’t be t he sum m ary nodes .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : We ’d have t he sum m ary nodes like
m e003 [ s.%−] : where t he t hings were [ disfm arker] I guess m aybe if t hi
if t hings were relat ed t o business or som e ot her [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ cs.%−−] : So what I was gonna say is [ disfm arker] is m aybe a
good at t his point is t o t ry t o inform ally [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ b] : Yeah .

m e010 [ s^ cs^ e] : I m ean , not necessarily in t h in t his m eet ing , but t o
t ry t o inform ally t hink about what t he decision variables are .
m e010 [ fh|s] : So , if you have som e bot t om line uh decision about
which m ode ,
m e010 [ s] : you know , what are t he m ost relevant t hings .
m e003 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ s] : And t he ot her t rick , which is not a t echnical t rick , it ’s
kind of a knowledge engineering t rick , is t o m ake t he n [ pause] each
node sufficient ly narrow t hat you don’t get t his com binat orics .
m e010 [ fh|s] : So t hat if you decided t hat y ou could charact erize t he
decision as a t rade − off bet ween t hree fact ors , what ever t hey m ay be
,
m e010 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ?
m e010 [ s] : t hen y ou could say " Aha , let ’s have t hese t hree fact ors "
,
m e010 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ?
m e010 [ s^ cs] : and m aybe a binary version f for each , or som e
relat iv ely com pact decision node just above t he final one .
m e003 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ s] : And t hen t he quest ion would be if [ disfm arker] if t hose are
t he t hings t hat y ou care about , uh can you m ake a relat ively com pact
way of get t ing from t he various input s t o t he t hings you care about .
m e010 [ s^ cs] : So t hat y so t hat , y ou know , you can sort of t ry t o do
a knowledge engineering t hing
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : given t hat we ’re not gonna screw wit h t he t echnology and
just alway s use uh sort of ort hodox Bayes − net s , t hen we have a
knowledge engineering lit t le problem of how do we do t hat .
m e010 [ fh] : Um
m e010 [ fh] : and
m e003 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So what I kind of need t o do is t o t ake t his one
and t he old one and m erge t hem t oget her ?
m e010 [ %] : " Eh − eh − eh . "
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e003 [ %−] : So t hat [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ h|s^ aap] : Well , m m m , som et hing .
m e010 [ fh|s] : I m ean , so uh , Robert has t hought about t his problem f
for a long t im e , cuz he ’s had t hese exam ples kicking around ,
m e010 [ s] : so he m ay have som e good int uit ion about you know ,
what are t he crucial t hings .
m e003 [ b] : Mm m .
m e010 [ fh|s.%−−] : and , um , I underst and where t his [ disfm arker] t he
uh [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : t his is a way of playing wit h t his abs Source − pat h − goal
t raject or ex p uh uh abst ract ion and [ disfm arker] and sort of sh
display ing it in a part icular way .

m e003 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ h|s.%−−] : Uh , I don’t t hink our friends uh on Wednesday are
going t o be able t o [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bc] : Well , m aybe t hey will .
m e010 [ s^ co] : Well , let m e t hink about whet her [ disfm arker] whet her
I t hink we can present t his t o t hem or not .
m e010 [ fh] : Um ,
m e010 [ fh] : Uh ,
m n015 [ s] : Well , I t hink t his is st ill , I m ean , ad − hoc .
m n015 [ s] : This is sort of t h t he second [ v ocalsound] version and I
[ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] look at t his m aybe just as a ,
y ou know , a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] what ever , UML diagram or ,
y ou know , as just a uh screen shot , not really as a Bayes − net as
John [ disfm arker] Johno said .
m e003 [ s^ cs] : We could act ually , y y eah draw it in a different way , in
t he sense t hat it would m ake it m ore abst ract .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : But t he uh [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he nice t hing is
t hat y ou know , it just is a [ disfm arker] is a visual aid for t hinking about
t hese t hings which has com ple clearly have t o be specified m m ore
carefully
m n015 [ %−] : and uh
m e010 [ fg|s^ co] : Alright , well , le let m e t hink about t his som e m ore ,
m e010 [ fh|s] : and uh see if we can find a way t o present t his t o t his
linguist s group t hat [ disfm arker] t hat is helpful t o t hem .
m n015 [ fg|s.%−−] : I m ean , ult im at ely we [ disfm arker] we m ay w w
m n015 [ s] : we regard t his as sort of an exercise in [ disfm arker] in
t hinking about t he problem
m n015 [ s.%−−] : and m aybe a first version of uh a m odule , if you wanna
call it t hat , t hat you can ask ,
m n015 [ s] : t hat y ou can give input
m n015 [ s] : and it it ’ll uh t hrow t he dice for you ,
m n015 [ s^ bc] : uh t hrow t he die for you ,
m n015 [ s^ df] : because um I int egrat ed t his int o t he exist ing
Sm art Kom sy st em in [ disfm arker] in t he sam e way as m uch t he sam e
way we can um sort of have t his uh [ disfm arker] t his t hing .
m n015 [ s^ t 1] : Close t his down .
m n015 [ s] : So if t his is what M − t hree − L um will look like and what it ’ll
giv e us ,
m n015 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : And a v ery sim ple t hing .
m n015 [ s] : We have an act ion t hat he want s t o go from som ewhere ,
which is som e t y pe of object , t o som eplace .
m e010 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : And t his [ disfm arker] t hese uh [ disfm arker] t his
changed now only um , um [ disfm arker]

m n015 [ s] : It ’s doing it t wice now because it already did it once .
m n015 [ fh|s^ cc] : Um , we ’ll add som e act ion t ype , which in t his case
is " Approach " and could be , you know , m ore refined uh in m any ways
.
m e010 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ b] : Good .
m n015 [ s] : Or we can uh have som et hing where t he uh goal is a public
place
m n015 [ s] : and it will give us t hen of course an act ion t ype of t he t ype
" Ent er " .
m n015 [ s^ bs] : So t his is just based on t his one [ disfm arker] um , on
t his one feat ure ,
m n015 [ s] : and t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s about all you can do .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : And so in t he f
m n015 [ s] : if t his pla if t he object t y pe um here is [ disfm arker] is a m
is a landm ark , of course it ’ll be um " Vist a " .
m n015 [ fh|s] : And um t his is about as m uch as we can do if we don’t w
if we want t o avoid uh uh a huge com binat orial explosion where we
specify " OK , if it ’s t his and t his but t hat is not t he case " , and so
fort h , it just get s really really m essy .
m e010 [ fg] : OK , I ’m sorry .
m e010 [ %−−] : You ’re [ disfm arker] you ’re [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qw] : Hm m ?
m e010 [ s] : It was m uch t oo quick for m e .
m e010 [ s^ co] : OK , so let m e see if I underst and what you ’re saying .
m e010 [ fh|s^ bs.%−−] : So , I [ disfm arker] I do underst and t hat uh you
can t ake t he M − t hree − L and add not [ disfm arker] and it w
m e010 [ s^ co] : and you need t o do t his , for sure ,
m e010 [ s^ cc] : we have t o add , you know , not t oo m uch about um
object t y pes and st uff ,
m e010 [ s^ bu] : and what I t hink y ou did is add som e rules of t he st yle
t hat are already t here t hat say " If it ’s of t ype " Landm ark " , t hen you
t ake [ disfm arker] you ’re gonna t ake a pict ure of it . "
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Exact ly .
m e010 [ s] : F full st op ,
m e010 [ s] : I m ean , t hat ’s what you do .
m e010 [ s] : Ev − every landm ark you t ake a pict ure of ,
m n015 [ s] : Every public place you ent er , and st at ue you want t o go
as near as possible .
m e010 [ s] : y ou ent er [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ 2] : You approach .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ fh|s] : Uh , and cert ainly you can add rules like t hat t o t he
ex ist ing Sm art Kom syst em .
m e010 [ s] : And y ou just did ,
m e010 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?

m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : And it [ disfm arker] it would do us no good .
m n015 [ s] : That [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ h] : Ah .
m n015 [ s] : Ult im at ely .
m n015 [ %−] : W
m e010 [ fg|s^ co] : Well . So , s well , and let ’s t hink about t his .
m e010 [ fh|s] : Um , t hat ’s a [ disfm arker] t hat ’s anot her kind of
baseline case ,
m e010 [ s] : t hat ’s anot her sort of t hing " OK , here ’s a [ disfm arker]
anot her kind of m inim al uh way of t ackling t his " .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : Add ext ra propert ies ,
m e010 [ s] : a det erm inist ic rule for every propert y
m e010 [ s] : y ou have an act ion , " pppt ! "
m e010 [ s] : You do t hat .
m e010 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um , t hen t he quest ion would be
m e010 [ fh|s] : Uh Now , if t hat ’s all you ’re doing , t hen you can get
t he t y pes from t he ont ology ,
m e010 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ?
m e010 [ s^ df] : because t hat ’s all [ disfm arker] you ’re [ disfm arker] all
y ou ’re using is t his t ype [ disfm arker] t he t ypes in t he ont ology and you
’re done .
m n015 [ qw^ rt ] : Hm m ?
m e010 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e010 [ s] : So we don’t [ disfm arker] we don’t use t he discourse , we
don’t use t he cont ext , we don’t do any of t hose t hings .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : No .
m e010 [ s] : Alright , but t hat ’s [ disfm arker] but t hat ’s OK , and I m ean
it it ’s again a kind of one m inim al ext ension of t he exist ing t hings .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : And t hat ’s som et hing t he uh Sm art Kom people
t hem selves would [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : t hey ’d say " Sure , t hat ’s no problem [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : you know , no problem t o add t ypes t o t he ont "
m e010 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n015 [ %−−] : And
m n015 [ s.%−−] : t his is [ disfm arker] just in order t o exem plify what
[ disfm arker] what we can do very , very easily is , um
m n015 [ s] : we have t his [ disfm arker] t his silly uh int erface and we

m n015 [ s.%−−] : Now , t he cont ent [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ b] : Hm m .

m n015 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] whi which is sort of what [ disfm arker] what
we see here , which is sort of t he Vist a , Schem a , Source , Pat h , Goal

m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : This will um be um a job t o find ways of writ ing down Im age
schem a , X − schem a , const ruct ions , in som e [ disfm arker] som e form ,
m n015 [ s] : and have t his be in a [ disfm arker] in a [ disfm arker] in t he

m n015 [ s] : loosely called " Const ruct icon " .
m n015 [ s] : And t he rules we want t o t hrow away com plet ely .
m n015 [ fh|s] : And um [ disfm arker] and here is exact ly where what ’s

m n015 [ s] : which is exact ly get t ing t he input feeding int o here .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : This decides whet her it ’s an whet her act ion

m n015 [ s] : or t he what ever
m e010 [ s^ bsc] : Uh , " approach " , you called it , I t hink t his t im e .
m n015 [ s] : uh Approach um const ruct ion should be act ivat ed , IE just

m e010 [ s] : That ’s what you said [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ ba] : Yeah , t hat ’s fine .
m e010 [ fg] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ fg] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ nd] : But it ’s not const ruct ion t here , it ’s act ion .
m e010 [ s] : Const ruct ion is a d is a different st ory .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : This is uh [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : so what we ’d be generat ing would be a reference
t o a sem ant ic uh like param et ers for t he [ disfm arker] for t he X −

m e010 [ s^ 2.%−] : For [ disfm arker] for [ disfm arker] for [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat uh
m e010 [ s] : i if y ou had t he generalized " Go " X − schem a
m e010 [ s] : and y ou want ed t o specialize it t o t hese t hree ones , t hen
y ou would hav e t o supply t he param et ers .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ cs] : And t hen uh , alt hough we haven’t worried about t his
y et , y ou m ight wanna worry about som et hing t hat would go t o t he GIS

m e010 [ s^ cs] : and use t hat t o act ually get you know , det ailed rout e

m e010 [ fh|s^ e] : So , you know , where do you do t ake a pict ure of it
and st uff like t hat .
m e003 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : But t hat ’s not [ disfm arker] It ’s not t he im m ediat e problem
.
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ fh|s.%−−] : But , presum ably t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat funct ionalit y ’s t here when [ disfm arker] when we [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ bu.%−] : So t he im m ediat e problem is just deciding w which
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ 2] : Aspect s of t he X − schem a t o add .
m e010 [ fg|s] : Yeah , so t he pro The im m ediat e problem is [ disfm arker]
is back t t t o what you were [ disfm arker] what you are doing wit h t he

m e003 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ fh|qh] : You know , uh what are we going t o use t o m ake t his

m e003 [ qh] : Right and t hen , once we ’v e m ade t he decision , how do
we put t hat int o t he cont ent ?
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : Well , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat act ually is relat ively easy in
t his case .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : The harder problem is we decide what we want t o use ,
how are we gonna get it ?
m e010 [ s] : And t hat t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he
hardest problem .
m e010 [ s] : So , t he hardest problem is how are you going t o get t his
inform at ion from som e com binat ion of t he [ disfm arker] what t he

m e010 [ %−−] : The h
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So , I t hink t hat ’s t he hardest problem at t he m om ent
is [ disfm arker] is
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : where are you gonna [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : how are you gonna g get t his inform at ion .
m e010 [ fh] : Um ,
m e010 [ s^ t ^ t c] : and t hat ’s [ disfm arker] so , get t ing back t o here ,
m e010 [ fh|s.%−−] : uh , we have a d a t echnical problem wit h t he belief −
net s t hat we [ disfm arker] we don’t want all t he com
m e003 [ s^ 2] : There ’s just t oo m any fact ors right now .

m e010 [ s^ m ] : t oo m any fact ors if we [ disfm arker] if we allow t hem t o
just go com binat orially .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : So we wanna t hink about which ones we really care about
m e010 [ s] : and what t hey really m ost depend on ,
m e010 [ s.%−] : and can we c you know , clean t his [ disfm arker] t his up
t o t he point where it [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ bu.%−−] : So what we really wanna do i
m e003 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : cuz t his is really just t he t hree layer net , we
wanna b m ake it [ disfm arker] expand it out int o m ore layers basically ?
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ am ] : We m ight .
m e010 [ fh|s] : Uh , I m ean t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s cert ainly one t hing
we can do .
m e010 [ fh|s.%−−] : Uh , it ’s t rue t hat t he way you have t his , a lot of t he
t im es you have [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : what you ’re having is t he v alues rat her t han t he variable .
m e010 [ fh] : So uh [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK ?
m e003 [ s^ bu] : So inst ead of in inst ead it should really be [ disfm arker]
just be " int ent ion " as a node inst ead of " int ent ion business " or "
int ent ion t our " .
m e010 [ %−] : So you [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e010 [ fg] : right ,
m e010 [ s^ e] : and t hen it would hav e values , uh , " Tour " , " Business
" , or uh " Hurried " .
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : But t hen [ disfm arker] but i it st ill som e knowledge design
t o do , about i how do you wanna break t his up , what really m at t ers .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : I m ean , it ’s fine .
m e010 [ s] : You know , we have t o [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
it erat iv e .
m e010 [ s^ cc] : We ’re gonna have t o work wit h it som e .
m e003 [ s] : I t hink what was going t hrough m y m ind when I did it was
som eone could bot h have a business int ent ion and a t ouring int ent ion
m e003 [ fh] : and
m e003 [ s.%−] : t he probabilit ies of bot h of t hem happening at t he
sam e t im e [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : Well , y ou [ disfm arker] you could do t hat .
m e010 [ s] : And it ’s perfect ly OK [ pause] t o uh insist t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat , you know , t h um , t hey add up t o one ,
m e010 [ s^ e] : but t hat t here ’s uh [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
it doesn’t have t o be one zero zero .

m e003 [ s^ bk] : Mm m .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ qy ^ d^ g] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ cs.%−−] : So you could have t he condit ional p
m e010 [ fh] : So
m e010 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] each of t hese t hings is gonna be a
[ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a probabilit y .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So whenever t here ’s a choice ,
m e010 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : so like landm ark − ness and usefulness ,
m e003 [ s^ nd.%−−] : Well , see I don’t t hink t hose would be m ut ually
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ qy^ d^ g] : OK [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s.%−] : it seem s like som et hing could bot h be [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Absolut ely right .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s^ cs.%−−] : And so t hat you m ight want t o t hen have t hose
m e010 [ s] : b Th − Then t hey m ay have t o be separat e .
m e010 [ s] : They m ay not be able t o be values of t he sam e variable .
m n015 [ s^ 2] : Object t ype ,
m n015 [ b] : m m − hm m .
m e010 [ %−−] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : but again , t his is [ disfm arker] t his is t he sort of knowledge
design y ou have t o go t hrough .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : It ’s [ disfm arker] you know , it ’s great [ disfm arker] is
[ disfm arker] is , you know , as one st ep t oward uh [ disfm arker] t oward
where we wanna go .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : Also it st rikes m e t hat we [ disfm arker] we m m ay want
t o approach t he point where we can sort of t ry t o find a [ disfm arker]
uh , a specificat ion for som e int erface , here t hat um t akes t he norm al
M − t hree − L , looks at it .
m n015 [ s] : Then we discussed in our pre − edu [ disfm arker] EDU
m eet ing um how t o ask t he ont ology , what t o ask t he ont ology
m n015 [ fh|s] : um t he fact t hat we can pret end we have one , m ake a
dum m y unt il we get t he real one ,
m n015 [ fh|s^ cs] : and so um we [ disfm arker] we m ay wanna decide we
can do t his from here ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : but we also could do it um y ou know if we have a
[ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a belief − net int erface .
m n015 [ s] : So t he belief − net t akes as input , a vect or ,
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n015 [ s^ e] : of st uff .
m n015 [ s.%−] : And it [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : And um it Out put is what ever , as well .

m n015 [ fh|s^ rt ] : But t his inform at ion is just M − t hree − L ,
m n015 [ s] : and t hen we want t o look up som e m ore st uff in t he
ont ology
m n015 [ s.%−−] : and we want t o look up som e m ore st uff in t he
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ cs] : m ay be we want t o ask t he real world ,
m n015 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : m aybe you want t o look som et hing up in t he GRS ,
m n015 [ s] : but also we definit ely want t o look up in t he dialogue
hist ory um som e s som e st uff .
m n015 [ %−−] : Based on
m n015 [ s.%−−] : we [ disfm arker] we hav e uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : I was just m ade som e exam ples from t he ont ology
m n015 [ s] : and so we have for exam ple som e inform at ion t here t hat
t he t own hall is bot h a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a building and it has
doors and st uff like t his ,
m n015 [ s] : but it is also an inst it ut ion , so it has a m ayor and so fort h
and so fort h
m n015 [ s] : and we get relat ions out of it and once we have t hem , we
can use t hat inform at ion t o look in t he dialogue hist ory ,
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ] : " were any of t hese t hings t hat [ disfm arker] t hat are
part of t he t own hall as an inst it ut ion m ent ioned ? " ,
m e010 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ] : " were any of t hese t hat m ake t he t own hall a building
m ent ioned ? " ,
m e012 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s] : and so fort h ,
m n015 [ s^ cs] : and m aybe draw som e inferences on t hat .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : So t his m ay be a [ disfm arker] a sort of a process of t wo
t o t hree st eps before we get our vect or , t hat we feed int o t he belief −
net ,
m n015 [ %−] : and t hen [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s] : I t hink t hat ’s [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat ’s exact ly right .
m e010 [ s] : There will be rules , but t hey aren’t rules t hat com e t o final
decisions , t hey ’re rules t hat gat her inform at ion for a decision process
.
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e010 [ s^ ba] : no I t hink t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s just fine .
m e010 [ h|s^ aa] : Uh , yeah .
m e010 [ s.%−] : So t hey ’ll [ disfm arker] t hey [ disfm arker] presum ably
t here ’ll be a t hread or process or som et hing t hat
m e010 [ s^ m ^ na] : " Agent " , y eah , " Agent " , what ever you wan
wanna say , yeah ,
m e010 [ s^ e] : t hat uh is rule − driv en , and can [ disfm arker] can uh
[ disfm arker] can do t hings like t hat .

m e010 [ fh|s] : And um t here ’s an issue about whet her t here will be
[ disfm arker] t hat ’ll be t he sam e agent and t he one t hat t hen goes off
and uh carries out t he decision ,
m e010 [ s] : so it probably will .
m e010 [ s.%−] : My guess is it ’ll be t he sam e basic agent t hat um can
go off and get inform at ion , run it t hrough a [ disfm arker] a c t his belief
− net t hat [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ m ] : t urn a crank in t he belief − net ,
m e010 [ s] : t hat ’ll com e out wit h s uh m ore [ disfm arker] anot her
v ect or ,
m e010 [ s^ f] : OK ,
m e010 [ s] : which can t hen be uh applied at what we would call t he
sim ulat ion or act ion end .
m e010 [ s] : So y ou now know what you ’re gonna do
m e010 [ fh|s] : and t hat m ay act ually involve get t ing m ore inform at ion .
m e010 [ s:s^ fe] : So on once you pull t hat out , it could be t hat t hat
say s " Ah !
m e010 [ s] : Now t hat we know t hat we gonna go ask t he ont ology
som et hing else . "
m e010 [ qy^ d^ g] : OK ?
m e010 [ s] : Now t hat we know t hat it ’s a bus t rip ,
m e010 [ qy ^ d^ g] : OK ?
m e010 [ s] : we didn’t [ disfm arker] We didn’t need t o know beforehand
, uh how long t he bus t rip t akes or what ev er , but [ disfm arker] but now
t hat we know t hat ’s t he way it ’s com ing out t hen we got t a go find out
m ore .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : So I t hink t hat ’s OK .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : So t his is act ually , s if [ disfm arker] if we were t o build
som et hing t hat is um ,
m n015 [ h|s] : and , uh , I had one m ore t hing ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : t he [ disfm arker] it needs t o do [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ cc] : I t hink we [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I can com e up wit h
a [ disfm arker] a code for a m odule t hat we call t he " cognit ive
dispat cher " , which does not hing ,
m e010 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : but it looks of com plect object t rees and decides how
[ disfm arker] are t here part s m issing t hat need t o be filled out ,
m n015 [ s] : t here ’s [ disfm arker] t his is m aybe som et hing t hat t his

m n015 [ s] : and t hen collect uh sub − object s and t hen recom bine

m n015 [ s^ cs] : So m aybe t his is act ually som e [ disfm arker] som e
useful t ool t hat we can use t o rewrit e it , and uh get t his part ,

m e010 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e010 [ fg] : Uh .
m n015 [ %−−] : t hen .
m n015 [ s] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s] : I confess , I ’m st ill not com plet ely com fort able wit h t he

m e010 [ h] : Um .
m e010 [ %−−] : I
m e010 [ s^ cc] : i This [ disfm arker] t his is not a com plaint , t his is a

m e010 [ s] : So I ’m gonna haft a t hink about it som e m ore .
m e010 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um . In part icular [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : see what we ’d like t o do , and [ disfm arker] and t his has
been im plicit in t he discussion , is t o do t his in such a way t hat you get
a lot of re − use .
m e010 [ fh|s] : So . What you ’re t rying t o get out of t his deep co
cognit iv e linguist ics is t he fact t hat w if y ou know about source
[ disfm arker] source , pat hs and goals , and nnn [ com m ent ] all t his sort
of st uff , t hat a lot of t his is t he sam e , for different t asks .
m e010 [ s] : And t hat [ disfm arker] uh t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s
som e [ disfm arker] som e im port ant generalit ies t hat you ’re get t ing ,
m e010 [ s] : so t hat y ou don’t t ake each and every one of t hese t asks
and haft a re − do it .
m e010 [ s] : And I don’t yet see how t hat goes .
m e010 [ s.%] : Alright .
m n015 [ s.%−] : There ’re no prim it ives upon which [ pause] uh
m e010 [ qw.%−−] : u u What are t he prim it ives , and how do you break
t his [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ b] : yeah .
m e010 [ s] : So I y I ’m just [ disfm arker] just t here saying eee
[ com m ent ] well y ou [ disfm arker] I know how t o do any individual case ,
m e010 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e010 [ s.%−−] : but I don’t yet [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : see what ’s t he really int erest ing quest ion is can you use
uh deep uh cognit iv e linguist ics t o [ pause] get powerful
generalizat ions .
m e010 [ fh] : And
m n015 [ b] : Yep .
m e010 [ fh] : um
m n015 [ s^ cs.%−−] : Maybe we sho
m n015 [ qy :qw^ rt ] : should we a add t hen t he " what ’s t his ? " dom ain
?
m n015 [ %−−] : N
m n015 [ s] : I m ean , we have t o
m n015 [ s:qw] : " how do I get t o X " .

m n015 [ s.%−−:qw.%−−] : Then we also have t he " what ’s t his ? " dom ain ,
where we get som e slight ly different [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ qy.%−] : Could . Uh .
m n015 [ s] : Um Johno , act ually , does not allow us t o call t hem "
int ent ions " any m ore .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : So he [ disfm arker] he dislikes t he t erm .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : Well , I [ disfm arker] I don’t like t he t erm eit her , so I
have n i
m e010 [ fg] : uh
m e010 [ %] : i i y w i i
m e010 [ %−−] : It uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ fg|s] : But um , I ’m sure t he " what ’s t his ? " quest ions also
creat e som e int erest ing X − schem a aspect s .
m e010 [ s^ am ] : Could be .
m n015 [ fh] : So .
m e010 [ s] : I ’m not a [ disfm arker] I ’m not op part icularly opposed t o
adding t hat or any ot her t ask ,
m e010 [ s] : I m ean , event ually we ’re gonna want a whole range of
t hem .
m n015 [ b^ rt ] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right .
m e010 [ h] : Uh ,
m e010 [ s^ cc] : I ’m just saying t hat I ’m gonna haft a do som e sort of
first principles t hinking about t his .
m e010 [ s^ no] : I just at t he m om ent don’t know .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ %−] : H
m e010 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e010 [ s^ ar|s.%−] : Well , no t he Bay es [ disfm arker] t he Bayes − net s
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ m ] : The Bayes − net s will be dec specific for each decision .
m e010 [ s] : But what I ’d like t o be able t o do is t o have t he way t hat
y ou ex t ract propert ies , t hat will go int o different Bayes − net s , be t he
[ disfm arker] uh general .
m e010 [ s] : So t hat if you have sources , you have t raject ors and st uff
like t hat ,
m e010 [ s^ e] : and t here ’s a language for t alking about t raject ors ,
m e010 [ s] : y ou shouldn’t have t o do t hat different ly
m e010 [ s] : for uh uh going t o som et hing , t han for circling it ,
m e010 [ s] : for uh t elling som eone else how t o go t here ,
m n015 [ s^ 2.%−] : Get t ing out of [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : what ever it is .
m e010 [ s] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat , t he [ disfm arker] t he decision
processes are gonna be different

m e010 [ s] : What you ’d really like of course is t he sam e t hing you ’d
always like which is t hat you have um a kind of int erm ediat e
represent at ion which looks t he sam e o ov er a bunch of input s and a
bunch of out put s .
m e010 [ fh|s] : So all sort s of different t asks [ pause] and all sort s of
different way s of expressing t hem use a lot of t he sam e m echanism for
pulling out what are t he fundam ent al t hings going on .
m e010 [ fh|s] : And t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat would be t he really pret t y
result .
m e010 [ fh|s] : And pushing it one st ep furt her , when you get t o
const ruct ion gram m ar and st uff , what you ’d like t o be able t o do is
say y ou have t his parser which is m uch fancier t han t he parser t hat
com es wit h uh Sm art Kom ,
m e010 [ s] : i t hat [ disfm arker] t hat act ually uses const ruct ions and is
able t o t ell from t his const ruct ion t hat t here ’s uh som et hing about t he
int ent [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : y ou know , t he act ual what people wanna do or what t hey
’re referring t o and st uff ,
m e010 [ s] : in independent of whet her it [ disfm arker] about
[ disfm arker] what is t his or where is it or som et hing , t hat you could
t ell from t he const ruct ion , you could pull out deep sem ant ic
inform at ion which y ou ’re gonna use in a general way .
m e010 [ s.%−] : So t hat ’s t he [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ am ] : You m ight .
m e010 [ s^ am ^ r] : You m ight .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : You m ight be able t o [ disfm arker] t o uh
m e010 [ s.%−−] : say t hat t his i t his is t he kind of const ruct ion in which
t he [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : t here ’s [ disfm arker] Let ’s say t here ’s a uh cont
m e010 [ s] : t here [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he land t he
const ruct ion im plies t he t here ’s a con t his t hing is being viewed as a
cont ainer .
m e010 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : So just from t his local const ruct ion you know t hat you ’re
gonna haft a t reat it as a cont ainer you m ight as well go off and get
t hat inform at ion .
m e010 [ s] : And t hat m ay effect t he way you process everyt hing else .
m e010 [ s] : So if y ou say " how do I get int o t he cast le "
m e010 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : OK ,
m e010 [ %−−] : t hen um [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : Or , you know , " what is t here in t he cast le " or
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : so t here ’s all sort s of t hings you m ight ask t hat involv e
t he cast le as a cont ainer

m e010 [ s] : and y ou ’d like t o have t his ort hogonal so t hat anyt im e t he
cast le ’s referred t o as a cont ainer , you crank up t he appropriat e st uff
.
m e010 [ s^ e] : Independent of what t he goal is , and independent of
what t he surrounding language is .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ t c] : Alright , so t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he [ disfm arker]
t hat ’s t he t hesis level
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : It ’s unfort unat e also t hat English has sort of got rid of
m ost of it s spat ial adverbs
m n015 [ s^ df] : because t hey ’re really fancy t hen , in [ disfm arker] in
[ disfm arker] for t hese kinds of analysis .
m n015 [ fh] : But uh .
m e010 [ s^ ng.%−] : Well , you have preposit ional phrases t hat
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ aap] : Yeah , but t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re easier for
parsers .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n015 [ s] : Parsers can pick t hose up but [ disfm arker] but t he
[ disfm arker] wit h t he spat ial adverbs , t hey have a t ough t im e .
m n015 [ s] : Because t he [ disfm arker] m ean t he sem ant ics are very
com plex in t hat .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n015 [ b] : OK , y eah ?
m n015 [ s^ t 1] : I had one m ore [ pause] t hing .
m n015 [ s^ no] : I don’t rem em ber .
m n015 [ s] : I just forgot it again .
m n015 [ h] : No .
m n015 [ s^ fe] : Oh y eah ,
m n015 [ s] : b But an archit ect ure like t his would also enable us m aybe
t o [ disfm arker] t o t hrow t his away and [ disfm arker] and replace it wit h
som et hing else , or what ever ,
m n015 [ s] : so t hat we have [ disfm arker] so t hat t his is sort of t he
represent at ional form at s we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re
t alking about t hat are independent of t he problem ,
m n015 [ s] : t hat generalize over t hose problem s , and are oh , t of a
higher qualit y t han an any act ual what ev er um belief − net , or " X " t hat
we m ay use for t he decision m aking , ult im at ely .
m n015 [ s] : Should be decoupled , yeah .
m n015 [ b] : OK .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ fg|qy ^ rt ] : So , are we gonna be m eet ing here from now on ?

good in t he sense t hat she [ disfm arker] she showed us som e of t he
weaknesses
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n015 [ fh|s.%−] : and um also t he um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t he
fact t hat she was a real subject you know , is [ disfm arker] is

m n015 [ s.%−−] : So I t hink t hat um [ disfm arker] I m ean , w
m n015 [ s] : Looking [ disfm arker] just looking at t his dat a , list ening t o
it , what can we get out of it in t erm s of our problem ,
m n015 [ s] : for ex am ple , is , y ou know , she act ually m said
[ disfm arker] you know , she nev er s just spoke about ent ering , she
just want ed t o get som eplace , and she said for buying st uff .
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Nuh ?

m n015 [ s] : This would have been a classical um uh " Tango " , act ually
.
m n015 [ fh|s^ df] : Um , because graffit i is usually found on t he out side
and not on t he inside ,
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ fh] : but
m n015 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : So t he m ist ake [ com m ent ] would have m ake a m ist ake
