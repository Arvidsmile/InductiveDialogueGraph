m e010 [ %−] : S
m e010 [ qw^ t 3] : Who ’s going ?
m n036 [ fg|s] : So , uh [ disfm arker] So , uh , I was just going t o ask ,
m n036 [ fh] : um , [ vocalsound] so ,
m n036 [ qw.%−] : what is t he [ disfm arker] t he basic t hing t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat you are , um , obligat ed t o do , um , uh , by t he

m e010 [ b] : Ah !
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker] eh [ disfm arker] Yeah .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So , what happened is ,
m e010 [ s.%−−] : t here ’s t his , eh , uh [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : Robert was describing
m e010 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] There ’s t wo packages
m e010 [ s] : t here ’s a , uh , quot e parser ,
m e010 [ s] : t here ’s a part icular piece [ vocalsound] of t his big syst em ,

m e010 [ s] : which , in Germ an , uh , t akes t hese t sent ence t em plat es
and produces XML st ruct ures .
m n036 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : And one of our jobs was t o m ake t he English equivalent of
t hat .
m e010 [ s] : That , t hese guys did in a [ disfm arker] in a day .
m n036 [ b] : Right .
m n036 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : The ot her t hing is , at t he ot her end , roughly at t he sam e

an out put XML st ruct ure
m e010 [ s] : which is inst ruct ions for t he generat or .
m n036 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s^ f] : OK ?
m e010 [ s] : And t hen t here ’s a language generat or ,
m e010 [ s] : and t hen aft er t hat a s a synt hesizer t hat goes from an
XML st ruct ure t o , uh , language generat ion , t o act ual specificat ions
for a sy nt hesizer .
m e010 [ s] : Eh , but again , t here ’s one m odule in which t here ’s one

m n036 [ b] : Right .
m n036 [ b] : Right .
m n036 [ s^ bk] : Got it .
m e010 [ qy .%−−] : Is t hat [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : And t hat [ disfm arker] But as I say , t his is [ disfm arker] all
along was viewed as a kind of [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] a m a m inor
t hing ,
m e010 [ s.%−] : necessary , but [ disfm arker] but not [ disfm arker]
m n036 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e010 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m n036 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : And m uch m ore int erest ing is t he fact t hat , [ vocalsound]
as part of doing t his , we [ disfm arker] we are , you know , inherit ing
t his syst em t hat does all sort of t hese ot her [ vocalsound] t hings .
m n036 [ s^ ba] : That ’s great !
m n036 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : Not precisely what we want ,
m e010 [ s] : and t hat ’s [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t hat ’s wh where it
[ disfm arker] it get s difficult .
m e010 [ s] : And I [ disfm arker] I don’t pret end t o underst and yet what I
t hink we really ought t o do .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ fg|s^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : So , e enough of t hat ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : but I , uh , um ,
m n015 [ b] : m m m ,

m n015 [ s^ cc^ rt ] : t he e sort of , Johno and I will t ake up t hat
responsibilit y ,
m n015 [ s] : and , um , get a first draft of t hat .
m n015 [ s^ t ] : Now , we have um just , I t hink t wo m ore short t hings .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ fh|qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Um , y you guys sort of st art ed fight ing , uh ,
on t he Bay es − net " Noisy − OR " front ?
m e012 [ b.%] : Hm m .
m e012 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , I t hought I should , um , t alk a lit t le bit about
t hat ,
m e012 [ s^ df] : because t hat m ight be a good , uh , sort of
archit ect ure t o hav e , in general for , uh , problem s wit h , [ vocalsound]
y ou know , m ult iple input s t o a node .
m e010 [ s^ ba|s^ bk] : Good ! OK .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : Good .
m e010 [ qw] : And what ’s t he ot her one ?
m e010 [ s^ df] : so t hat [ disfm arker] just we know what t he d agenda is
?
m n015 [ s] : Um , t he Wu paper ,
m n015 [ s.%−] : I t hink m aybe [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Oh , yeah .
m e010 [ s] : I ’v e got a couple new Wu papers as well .
m e010 [ s] : Uh , so I [ disfm arker] I ’ve been in cont act wit h Wu ,
m e010 [ s] : so , probably let ’s put t hat off t ill I [ disfm arker] I
[ disfm arker] t ill I underst and bet t er , [ vocalsound] uh , what he ’s
doing .
m e010 [ s] : It ’s just a lit t le em barrassing
m e010 [ s] : cause all t his was in his t hesis
m e010 [ s] : and I was on his t hesis com m it t ee ,
m e010 [ s] : and , so , [ vocalsound] I r really knew t his at one t im e .
m n036 [ b] : Ugh .
m e010 [ s] : But , I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] It ’s not only uh Is
[ disfm arker] Part of what I hav en’t figured out yet is [ disfm arker] is how
all t his goes t oget her .
m e010 [ s^ cc] : So I ’ll dig up som e m ore st uff from Dekai .
m e010 [ qh^ cs.%−] : And [ disfm arker] so why don’t we just do t he , uh
[ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e012 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ qy^ rt ] : should I [ disfm arker] Is t here a whit e board here t hat I
can use ?
m e010 [ s^ aa|s.%−] : Yeah . You could [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e012 [ qrr] : Or shall I just use t his ?
m e010 [ s.%] : squealing sound ?

m e010 [ s^ am ] : It ’s probably just as easy .
m e010 [ %−−] : I
m n036 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s^ cs] : You can put t he m icrophone in your pocket .
m e012 [ s^ ba] : Hey !
m e003 [ s] : I was env ying you and your pocket
m e003 [ s^ df] : cause I don’t have one .
fe004 [ s|qy ^ d^ g] : It was a quick one , huh ?
m e010 [ s] : That ’s why t hey invent ed " pocket T ’s " .
fe004 [ s] : They have clips !
m e003 [ s^ aa] : exact ly
fe004 [ b] : Huh .
m e012 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e012 [ fg|s^ t c] : So , um [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] Recall t hat , uh ,
we want t o have t his kind of st ruct ure in our Bayes − net s .
m e012 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Nam ely , t hat , um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
[ v ocalsound] You have t hese nodes t hat have several bands , right ?
m e012 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s.%−−] : Does I m ean , t hey sort of [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ rt ] : t he t y pical exam ple is t hat , um , t hese are all a bunch
of cues for som et hing ,
m e012 [ s] : and t his is a cert ain effect t hat we ’d like t o conclude .
m e012 [ fh] : So , uh [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Like , let ’s just look at t he case when , um , t his
is act ually t he [ disfm arker] t he final act ion , right ?
m e012 [ s] : So t his is like , uh , [ vocalsound] you know , t ouch ,
m n015 [ %−] : Y
m e012 [ %−−] : or [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ fa] : Sorry .
m n015 [ s] : E − EVA
m e012 [ fh] : Uh
m n015 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e012 [ s^ m |qy^ d^ f^ g] : E − [ vocalsound] EVA , right ?
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s|qy^ d^ f^ g] : Ent er , V View , Approach , right ?
m n036 [ qw] : W what was t his ?
m n036 [ s.%−−] : It [ disfm arker] i i i ehhh , [ com m ent ] i ehhh .
m e012 [ s.%−] : So , t his is [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ co.%−] : Wri − writ e it out for for [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n036 [ s.%−−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s:s] : Ent er ,
m e012 [ s:s] : View ,
m e012 [ s:s] : Approach .

m n036 [ s^ bk] : OK . Right .
m e012 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right .
m e012 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : So , I m ean , we ’d like t o [ disfm arker] t ake all
t hese v arious cues , right ?
m n036 [ s^ e^ t 3] : Like t he arm y .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : So t his one m ight be , say , uh [ disfm arker]
m n036 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ t 3] : New t erm inology ?
m e012 [ s] : Well , let m e pick a random one
m n015 [ b.%] : Hm m ?
fe004 [ s^ t 3] : I hav en’t heard t hat before .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : and say , uh [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ no] : I don’t know ,
m e012 [ s^ df^ rt ] : it could be , like [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] This isn’t
t he way it really is ,
m e012 [ s.%−−] : but let m e say [ disfm arker] t hat , suppose som eone
m ent ioned , uh , adm ission fees
m e012 [ s^ ba^ bd] : Ah , it t akes t oo long .
m e012 [ s:s] : Try [ disfm arker] let m e just say " Landm ark " .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : If t he t hing is a landm ark , you know , [ vocalsound] um
[ disfm arker] t hen t here ’s anot her t hing t hat says if [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] um [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ rt .%−−] : if it ’s closed or not , at t he m om ent .
m e012 [ s^ bk|s] : Alright , so y ou have nodes .
m e012 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e012 [ s.%−−] : And t he , uh , problem t hat we were having was t hat ,
y ou know , giv en N − nodes , t here ’s " t wo t o t he N "
m e012 [ s] : Given N − nodes , and furt herm ore , t he fact t hat t here ’s
t hree t hings here , we need t o specify " t hree t im es " , uh , " t wo t o t he
N " probabilit ies .
m e012 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e012 [ s] : That ’s assum ing t hese are all binary , which f t hey m ay not
be .
m e012 [ s] : For exam ple , t hey could be " t im e of day " ,
m e012 [ s] : in which case we could , uh , say , you know , " Morning ,
aft ernoon , ev ening , night " .
m e012 [ s] : So , t his could be m ore
m e012 [ s] : So , it ’s a lot , any way .
m e012 [ s] : And , t hat ’s a lot of probabilit ies t o put here , which is kind
of a pain .
m e012 [ fh|s] : So [ pause] Noisy − ORs are a way t o , uh , [ vocalsound]
sort of deal wit h t his .
m e012 [ fh] : Um
m e012 [ qw^ t 1] : Where should I put t his ?

m e012 [ s:s] : So , t he idea is t hat , um , [ v ocalsound] Let ’s call t hese ,
uh , C − one , C − t wo , C − t hree , and C − four , and E , for Cause and
Effect , I guess .
m e012 [ s] : The idea is t o have t hese int erm ediat e nodes .
m e012 [ s^ f] : Right .
m e012 [ s] : Well , act ually , t he idea , first of all , is t hat each of t hese
t hings has a [ disfm arker] quot e − unquot e dist inguished st at e ,
m e012 [ s] : which m eans t hat t his is [ vocalsound] t he st at e in which
we don’t really know anyt hing about it .
m e012 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
m e012 [ s] : So , for exam ple , if we don’t really know [ vocalsound] if t he
t hing is a landm ark or not , Or , i if t hat just doesn’t seem relevant ,
t hen t hat would be t h sort of t he Dist ing − t he Dist inguish st at e .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : It ’s a really , you know , [ v ocalsound] if t here is
som et hing for t he person t alking about t he adm ission fee ,
m e012 [ s] : y ou know , if t hey didn’t t alk about it , t hat would be t he
Dist inguish st at e .
m e012 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : S so , t his is a fanciful way of saying " default " ?
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e012 [ s] : That ’s just what t hey [ disfm arker] t he word t hey used in
t hat paper .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s|qy^ d^ f^ g] : So , t he idea is t hat , um , [ vocalsound] you
have t hese int erm ediat e nodes , right ?
m e012 [ s^ rt :s^ rt ] : E − one , E − t wo , E − t hree and E − four ?
m e010 [ s^ bu] : So , t his is t he Heckerm an paper you ’re working wit h ?
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : Good .
m e012 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : So [ pause] The idea is t hat , each of t hese EI
[ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] represent s what t his would
be [ disfm arker] if all t he ot her ones were in t he dist inguish st at e .
Right ?
m e012 [ s] : So , for exam ple , suppose t hat t he person [ disfm arker] I
m ean , suppose t he t hing t hat t hey t alked about is a landm ark .
m e012 [ s^ e] : But none of t he ot her [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] sort of
cues really apply .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : Then , [ vocalsound] t his would be [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s.%−−] : W The [ vocalsound] t his would just represent t he
probabilit y dist ribut ion of t his ,
m e012 [ s] : assum ing t hat t his cue is t urned on and t he ot her ones
just didn’t apply ?

m e012 [ s] : So , y ou know , if it is a landm ark , and no none of t he
ot her t hings really ap applicable , t hen [ disfm arker] t his would
represent t he probabilit y dist ribut ion .
m e012 [ s^ rt ] : So m aybe in t his case [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] Maybe
we just t k Maybe we decide t hat , if t he t hing ’s a landm ark and we
don’t know any t hing else , t hen we ’re gonna conclude t hat , um
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] They want t o view it wit h probabilit y , you
know , point four .
m e012 [ s] : They want t o ent er it wit h probabilit y , uh [ disfm arker] wit h
probabilit y point five
m e012 [ s] : and t hey want t o approach it probabilit y point one , say
[ disfm arker]
m e012 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e012 [ s] : So we com e up wit h t hese l lit t le t ables for each of t hose
m e012 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : OK .
m e012 [ s^ df] : And t he final t hing is t hat , um [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] [ v ocalsound] t his is a det erm inist ic funct ion of t hese ,
m e012 [ s] : so we don’t need t o specify any probabilit ies .
m e012 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : We just have t o , um , say what funct ion t his is ,
right ?
m e012 [ s:s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : So we can let t his be , um [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] G of E − one com m a E − t wo . E − t hree , E − four . Right ?
m e012 [ s^ rt :s] : and our exam ple G would be , um , [ vocalsound] a
m ajorit y v ot e ?
m e012 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e010 [ fg|s] : Well . OK , so t h so t he im port ant point [ disfm arker] is
[ disfm arker] W not what t he G funct ion is .
m e010 [ s] : The im port ant point is [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] Um
[ disfm arker] There is a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a general kind of
idea of short cut t ing t he full CPT .
m e010 [ s^ e] : Th − c t he full condit ional probabilit y t able [ disfm arker]
wit h som e funct ion .
m e010 [ s^ f] : OK ?
m e010 [ s] : Which y w you choose appropriat ely for each case .
m e010 [ s] : So , depending on [ vocalsound] what your sit uat ion is ,
t here are different funct ions which are m ost appropriat e .
m e010 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : So I gave [ disfm arker] eh [ disfm arker] Bhaskara a copy of
t his , eh [ disfm arker] sort of " ninet y − t wo " [ com m ent ] paper .
m e012 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ bu] : D and you got one , Robert .
m e010 [ s^ no] : I don’t know who else has seen it .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : There ’s [ disfm arker] I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ b] : yeah .
m e012 [ s] : it ’s Heckerm an and Breese .
m e010 [ s^ ba] : It ’s short .

m e010 [ s^ m ^ na] : It ’s short .
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ qy ^ rt ] : So , I u w Um , y o uh [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker]
Hav e y ou read it yet ?
m e012 [ s^ cs] : Uh , you can [ disfm arker] Yeah , you should t ake a look
at it , I guess .
m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ cs] : OK , so you should t ake a look .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK
m e010 [ s] : Nancy , I ’m sure you read it at som e point in life .
fe004 [ %−−] : I [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
fe004 [ s^ na|s^ aa] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink so , yeah .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : And [ disfm arker] so , y ou ot her guys can decide how
int erest ed [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b.%] : Yeah , @ @ .
m e010 [ fg|s^ ba] : Anyway . So t he paper isn’t t h isn’t real hard .
m n036 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] Uh [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ qw] : One of t he quest ions just com e at Bhaskara is , " How
m uch of t his does Jav aBayes support ? "
m e012 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : Yeah , it ’s a good quest ion .
m e012 [ h|s] : Um [ pause] [ vocalsound] [ nonvocalsound] The
[ disfm arker] so what we want , is basically JavaBayes t o support
det erm inist ic , uh , funct ions .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e012 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : And , um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] In a sense it
sup we can m ake it support ed by , um , [ vocalsound] m anually , uh ,
ent ering , you know , probabilit ies t hat are one and zeros , right ?
m e010 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : Right . So t he lit t le handout t hat [ disfm arker] The
lit t le t hing t hat I sent [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−:s] : I sent a m essage saying , uh , here is a way t o t ake
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ cs] : One t hing you could do , which is kind of s in a way ,
st upid , is t ake t his det erm inist ic funct ion , and use it t o build t he CPT .
m e010 [ s] : So , if Ba − JavaBayes won’t do it for you ,
m n015 [ b.%] : Mm m .
m e010 [ s^ e] : t hat you can convert all t hat int o what t he CPT would be
.
m e010 [ fh|s] : Um [ disfm arker] and , what I sent out about a week ago
, was an idea of how t o do t hat , for , um , evidence com binat ion .
m e010 [ s^ cs] : So one of [ disfm arker] one funct ion t hat you could use
as y our " G funct ion " is an e e Evidence − Com bining .

m e010 [ s^ cs] : So y ou just t ake [ v ocalsound] t he [ disfm arker] uh , if
each of t h if each of t he ones has it s own lit t le t able like t hat ,
[ v ocalsound] t hen y ou could t ake t he , uh , st rengt h of each of t hose ,
t im es it s lit t le t able ,
m e010 [ s^ cs^ e] : and you ’d add up t he t ot al evidence for " V " , " E " ,
and " A " .
m e012 [ b] : Mm m .
m e012 [ s^ nd] : I don’t t hink you can do t his ,
fe004 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s^ df] : because [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] G is a funct ion from
[ pause] t hat [ v ocalsound] t o t hat .
m e010 [ b] : Yep .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e012 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e012 [ s] : So t here ’s no num bers .
m e012 [ s] : There ’s just [ disfm arker] quadruplet s of [ disfm arker] well ,
N − duplet s of , uh , E Vs .
m e010 [ %−−] : I i i
m e010 [ s^ ar|s.%−−] : No , no [ disfm arker] But I ’m saying is [ disfm arker]
There [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] There is a w
m e010 [ s] : I m ean , if y if [ disfm arker] if you decide what ’s
[ disfm arker] what is appropriat e , is probablist ic evidence com binat ion
, you can writ e a funct ion t hat does it .
m e010 [ s^ df] : It ’s a pui it ’s act ually one of t he exam ples he ’s got in
t here .
m e010 [ s] : But , anyway , s skipping [ disfm arker] skipping t he
quest ion of exact ly which funct ions [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ qy ] : now is it clear t hat you m ight like t o be able t o short cut
t he whole condit ional probabilit y t able .
m n015 [ s] : I m ean , in som e [ disfm arker] it seem s very plausible in
som e sense , where we will be likely t o not be [ disfm arker] observe
som e of t he st uff .
m n015 [ s^ df] : Cuz we don’t have t he a access t o t he inform at ion .
m e012 [ s^ fa^ t 1] : Oops , [ com m ent ] sorry .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e010 [ qh] : That ’s one of t he problem s , is , W Is [ disfm arker] is ,
Where would t h Where would it all com e from ?
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n015 [ fh] : So .
m e012 [ %−−] : Is [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b.%] : Mm m .
m e012 [ s^ bk] : Oh , right .
m e012 [ s^ m .%−−] : W would not be ab able t o observe
m e012 [ qw^ br] : What ?
m n015 [ s] : I if it ’s a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a discar Discourse
Init ial Phrase , we will have not hing in t he discourse hist ory .

m n015 [ s.%−] : So , if [ disfm arker] if we ever want t o wonder what was
m ent ion
m e012 [ b.%] : Oh [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ bk|qy ^ bu^ d] : Oh . A are you saying t hat we ’ll not be able
t o observ e cert ain nodes ?
m e012 [ s^ ba] : That ’s fine .
m e012 [ s^ df] : That is sort of ort hogonal t hing .
m e010 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , so t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s t wo separat e
t hings , Robert .
m e010 [ s] : The f t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he Bayes − net s in

about t his v ariable just t ake t he prior for t hat . "
m e010 [ s^ f|s] : OK ? Th − t hat ’s what t hey ’re real good at .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So , if you don’t hav e any inform at ion about t he
discourse , you just use your priors of [ disfm arker] of what ever
[ disfm arker] eh t he [ disfm arker] discourse [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ fh] : uh ,
m e010 [ s] : eh , basically what ever w it ’s [ disfm arker] Probabilist ically ,
what ev er it would be .
m e010 [ s] : And it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s sort of not a great est im at e ,
m n015 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] it ’s t he best one you have ,
m e010 [ s^ e] : and , so fort h .
m e010 [ s] : So t hat , t hey ’re good at .
m e010 [ qh] : But t he ot her problem is , how do you fill in all t hese
num bers ?
m e010 [ s] : And I t hink t hat ’s t he one he was get t ing at .
fe004 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s^ rt ] : So , specifically in t his case you have t o [ disfm arker] f
have t his m any num bers ,
m e012 [ s|qy^ d^ f^ g] : whereas in t his case you just have t o have
t hree for t his , t hree for t his , t hree for t his . Right ?
m e012 [ s^ rt ] : So you have t o have just t hree N ?
m n015 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s] : So , t his is m uch sm aller t han t hat .
m e003 [ s^ 2] : Asy m pt ot ically .
fe004 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ aap] : Well , pret t y quickly .
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e003 [ %−−] : U
m e003 [ s^ aa] : y eah , yeah .
fe004 [ s] : So , y ou don’t need da dat a enough t o cover [ disfm arker]
uh , nearly as m uch st uff .

m e010 [ %−−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m e003 [ s] : So , really , i What a [ disfm arker] A Noisy − OR seem s t o
kind of [ pause] " neural − net − acize " t hese Bayes − net s ?
m e010 [ s.%−−] : Eh [ disfm arker] well t o som e
m e010 [ s^ ar] : No , no .
m e010 [ s:s] : So , " Noisy − OR " is a funny way of referring t o t his ,
m e010 [ s^ df:s] : because [ vocalsound] t he Noisy − OR is only one
inst ance .
m e012 [ fg|s:s] : Yeah . This isn’t a Noisy − OR anym ore .
m e010 [ s^ na:s] : That one act ually isn’t a Noisy − OR .
m e010 [ s.%−] : So we ’ll have t o t hink of [ vocalsound] of a way t t
m e003 [ b] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s:s] : it ’s a Noisy − arg − m ax or a Noisy − what ever .
m e010 [ s^ aa|s^ bd] : Yeah , what ever .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e010 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker] Eh [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] Um
m e003 [ s^ df.%−−] : Well , m y point was m ore t hat we just [ disfm arker]
eh [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : Wit h t he neural net , right , eh , t hings com e in , you have
a funct ion t hat com bines t hem
m e003 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] Tha − t hat ’s
t rue .
m e010 [ s] : It is a is also m ore neural − net − like , alt hough
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] Uh , it isn’t necessarily sum [ disfm arker] uh ,

m e003 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : I m ean i You could hav e ,
m e010 [ s:s] : uh , like t he Noisy − OR funct ion , really is one t hat ’s

m e012 [ s^ aap] : Well , t he " OR " .
m e010 [ s^ df] : Sam e .
m e012 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Right . I guess you ’re right .
m e012 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e010 [ fh] : Uh
m e010 [ fg] : But anyway .
m e010 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : And , I t hi I t hink t hat ’s t he st andard way people get
around t he [ disfm arker] uh
m e010 [ s] : There are a couple ot her ones .
m e010 [ s] : There are ways of breaking t his up int o s t o [ disfm arker] t o

m e010 [ fh] : But , um
m e010 [ %−−] : The

m e010 [ s^ ba] : I t hink we definit ely [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s a great
idea t ha t o [ disfm arker] t o pursue t hat .
m e012 [ b.%] : Yep .
m e012 [ fh] : So
m n015 [ s] : Wha − st ill sort of leaves one quest ion .
m n015 [ s] : It [ disfm arker] I m ean y ou [ disfm arker] you can always uh
[ disfm arker] see easily t hat [ disfm arker] t hat I ’m not grasping
ev ery t hing correct ly ,
m n015 [ s:s] : but [ v ocalsound] what seem ed at t ract ive t o m e in im uh
in t he last discussion we had , was [ vocalsound] t hat we find out a
m eans of [ disfm arker] of get t ing t hese point four , point five , point
one , of C − four ,
m n015 [ s] : not because , you know , A is a Landm ark or not , but we
[ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] we label t his what ever object t ype ,
m n015 [ s:s] : and if it ’s a garden , it ’s point t hree , point four , point
t wo .
m n015 [ s:s] : If it ’s a cast le , it ’s point eight , point one , point one .
m n015 [ s^ rt :s] : If it ’s , [ vocalsound] uh , a t own hall , it ’s point t wo ,
point t hree , point five .
m e010 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s^ e] : And so fort h .
m n015 [ s] : And we don’t want t o writ e t his down [ disfm arker]
necessarily ev ery t im e for som et hing
m n015 [ fh] : but , uh [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s.%−−] : It ’ll be st udent s [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : let ’s see .
m e012 [ qw] : Where else would it be st ored ?
m e012 [ s] : That ’s t he quest ion .
m n015 [ s] : Well , in t he beginning , we ’ll writ e up a flat file .
m n015 [ s] : We know we have t went y object t ypes
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e010 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : and we ’ll writ e it down in a flat file .
m e010 [ fg] : No .
m e010 [ fg|%−−] : So , i is
m e010 [ s] : Well , let m e say som et hing , guys ,
m e010 [ s^ df] : cuz t here ’s not [ disfm arker] There ’s a pret t y point
about t his we m ight as well get in right now .
m e012 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : Which is [ disfm arker] The hierarchy t hat s com es wit h t he
ont ology is just what you want for t his .
m e010 [ s] : So t hat [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] Uh , if you know about it
[ disfm arker] let ’s say , a part icular t own hall [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
t hat , it ’s one t hat is a m onum ent , [ vocalsound] t hen , t hat would be
st ored t here .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : If y ou don’t , you look up t he hierarchy ,

m e010 [ s:s] : Eh [ disfm arker] so , you [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker]
y ou m ay or [ disfm arker] So , t hen you ’d have t his lit t le vect or of , um ,
y ou know , Approach Mode or EVA Mode .
m e010 [ s:s] : Let ’s [ disfm arker] OK , so we have [ vocalsound] t he EVA
v ect or for [ disfm arker] for various kinds of landm arks .
m e010 [ s] : If you know it for a specific landm ark you put it t here .
m e010 [ s] : If you don’t , you just go up t he hierarchy t o t he first place
y ou find one .
m e012 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e012 [ qy^ rt ] : So , is t he idea t o put it in t he ont ology ?
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Absolut ely .
m e012 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s:s] : Uh , or , link t o [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ %−−] : or [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] but in any case [ disfm arker] i View it
logically as being in t he ont ology .
m e010 [ s:s] : It ’s part of what you know about [ disfm arker] a
[ disfm arker] an object , [ vocalsound] is it s EVA vect or .
m e012 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e012 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : And , if y o As I say , if you know about a specific object ,
y ou put it t here .
m e010 [ s] : This is part of what Dekai was doing .
m e010 [ s] : So , when we get t o Wu , The − e We ’ll see w what he says
about t hat .
m e012 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : And , t hen if you [ disfm arker] If it isn’t t here , it ’s higher ,
m e010 [ s] : and if you don’t know any t hing except t hat it ’s a b it ’s
[ disfm arker] it ’s a [ disfm arker] building , t hen up at t he highest t hing ,
y ou hav e t he pr what am ount s t o a prior .
m e010 [ s] : If you don’t know anyt hing else about a building ,
[ v ocalsound] uh , y ou just t ake what ev er your crude approxim at ion is

m e012 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : which m ight be equal , or what ever it is .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s] : So , t hat ’s a very pret t y relat ionship bet ween t hese local

m e010 [ s] : And it seem s t o m e t he obvious t hing t o do , unless
[ v ocalsound] we find a reason t o do som et hing different .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m e010 [ qy ^ rt ] : Does t his m ake sense t o you ?
m e012 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ %−] : Bhask − ?
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

m e012 [ s^ bu] : So , we are [ disfm arker] but we [ disfm arker] we ’re not
doing t he ont ology ,
m e012 [ s^ bu.%−] : so we have t o get t o whoever is doing t he
[ disfm arker] u ult im at ely ,
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Indeed .
m e012 [ s.%−] : we have t o get t hem t o [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : So , t hat ’s anot her t hing we ’re gonna need t o do , is
[ disfm arker] is , t o , eit her [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : We ’re gonna need som e way t o eit her get a p t ag in t he

m e010 [ s.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] [ com m ent ] [ vocalsound]
som e way t o associat e [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : Or , w It m ay be t hat all we can do is , um , som e of our

m e010 [ s] : Th − t he [ disfm arker] t h y ou know , t here ’s always a way t o

m e010 [ s.%−−] : It ’s a just a quest ion of [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ %−] : i
m e003 [ fg|s] : Yeah , hash on object nam e t o , you know , uh , t he

m e010 [ %−] : t h
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ %−] : e
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e010 [ fg] : And , so ,
m e010 [ %−−] : i
m e010 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s.%−−] : But it ’s , uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] Well , it st rikes
m e as a What For
m n015 [ s] : If we get t he m echanism , t hat will be sort of t he wonderful
part .
m n015 [ s] : And t hen , [ vocalsound] how t o m ake it work is
[ disfm arker] is t he second part ,
m n015 [ s] : in t he sense t hat [ disfm arker] I m ean , m t he guy who was
doing t he ont ology [ disfm arker] eh , eh , s ap apologized t hat i it will
t ake him anot her t hrough [ disfm arker] t wo t o t hree days
m n015 [ s] : because t hey ’re having really t rouble get t ing t he upper
lev el st raight ,
m n015 [ %−−] : and
m n015 [ s^ e] : right now .
m n015 [ s] : The reason is , [ vocalsound] given t he craw bet uh , t he
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he project s t hat all carry t heir own
t ax onom y and , on all hist ory , [ vocalsound] t hey ’re really t rying t o
build one t op level ont ology ft t hat covers all t he EML project s ,
m n015 [ s^ ba] : and t hat ’s , uh , uh , sort of a t ough cookie ,
m n015 [ s] : a lit t le bit t ougher t han t hey [ vocalsound] figured .

m n015 [ s] : I could have t old t hem s so .
m e010 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n015 [ fh] : Uh .
m e010 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : But , nevert heless , it ’s going t o be t here by n by , uh ,
next Monday
m n015 [ s] : and I will show you what ’s [ disfm arker] what som e
ex am ples [ v ocalsound] from t hat for t owers , and st uff .
m n015 [ fh] : And , um ,
m n015 [ s] : what I don’t t hink is ever going t o be in t he ont ology , is
sort of , you know , t he likelihood of , eh , people ent ering r t own halls ,
and looking at t own halls , and approaching t own halls ,
m n015 [ s^ df] : especially since we are b dealing wit h a case − based ,
m n015 [ s^ df^ e] : not an inst ance − based ont ology .
m n015 [ s] : So , t here will be not hing on [ disfm arker] on t hat t own hall
, or on t he Berkeley t own hall , or on t he [ vocalsound] Heidelberg t own

m n015 [ s] : it ’ll just be inform at ion on t own halls .
m e010 [ qh^ df] : Well , t hey [ disfm arker] t hey [ disfm arker] t hey
[ disfm arker] How ar What are t hey gonna do wit h inst ances ?
m n015 [ %−] : But what [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−] : I m ean , you [ disfm arker] y
m n015 [ s.%−−] : Well , t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ b] : Hhh .
m n015 [ s] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s al different quest ion .
m n015 [ qh^ rt ] : I m ean , t h t he [ disfm arker] first , t hey had t o m ake a

inst ances ?
m n015 [ qh^ e] : or just one t hat does not , t hat just has t he t ypes ? "
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : And , so , since t he d decision was on t ypes , on a d sim ply
t y pe − based , [ v ocalsound] we now have t o hook it up t o inst ances .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : I m ean t his is
m n015 [ %−] : one [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ qw^ df] : But what i What is Sm art Kom gonna do about t hat ?
m e010 [ s^ df] : Cuz , t hey have inst ances all t he t im e .
m n015 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , but t he ont ology is really not a Sm art Kom
t hing ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : in [ disfm arker] in and of it self .
m n015 [ s] : That ’s m ore som et hing t hat [ vocalsound] I kicked loose in
[ disfm arker] in EML .
m n015 [ s] : So it ’s a com plet ely EML t hing .
m e010 [ s^ df] : But [ disfm arker] Uh [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker]
Sm art Kom ’s gonna need an ont ology .
m n015 [ s^ aa|s] : Yes , u a w a lot of people are aware of t hat .

m e010 [ s^ bk|qy ^ df] : I underst and , [ vocalsound] but is anybody
doing any t hing about it ?
m n015 [ h] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e010 [ s] : It ’s a polit ical problem .
m e010 [ s] : We won’t worry about it .
m n015 [ s^ ar|s] : No , but [ disfm arker] t h t he r eh [ disfm arker] I t h I st ill
t hink t hat t here is enough inform at ion in t here .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : For exam ple , whet her [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : OK . So , t h it will know about t he t went y object t ypes t here
are in t he world .
m n015 [ s] : Let ’s assum e t here are only t went y object t ypes in t his
world .
m n015 [ s] : And it will know if any of t hose have inst it ut ional m eanings
.
m n015 [ s] : So , in a sense , " I " used as Inst it ut ions for som e s in

m n015 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Which m akes t hem [ disfm arker] ent erable .
Right ?
m n015 [ s^ e] : In a sense .
m n015 [ s^ f] : You know .
m e010 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e010 [ fg|s.%−−] : Anyway . So we m ay have t o [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ b.%] : Yep .
m e010 [ s] : This is wit h t he whole t hing ,
m e010 [ s.%−−] : we m ay have t o build anot her dat a st ru
m n015 [ b] : Yep .
m e010 [ s] : Concept ually , we know what should be done .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : When we see what people have done , it m ay t urn out
t hat t he easiest t hing t o do [ vocalsound] is t o build a [ disfm arker] a
separat e t hing t hat [ disfm arker] t hat just pools i i
m e010 [ s.%−−] : Like , i i it [ disfm arker] it m ay be , t hat , t he
[ disfm arker] t he inst ance [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : w That we have t o build our own inst ance , uh , t hings ,
t hat , wit h t heir t y pes ,
m e012 [ fg|%−−] : Yeah , it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ aa|s.%−] : Right , we can just assum e [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s] : and t hen it goes off t o t he ont ology once you have it s t ype
.
m e010 [ s] : So we build a lit t le dat a st ruct ure
m e010 [ s] : And so what we would do in t hat case , is , in our inst ance
gadget have [ vocalsound] our E V
m e010 [ s] : And if we d t here isn’t one we ’d get t he t ype
m e010 [ s] : and t hen have t he E V As for t he t ype .
m e010 [ s] : So we ’d have our own lit t le , [ vocalsound] uh , EVA t ree .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .

m e010 [ s] : And t hen , for ot her , uh , v ect ors t hat we need .
m e012 [ b] : Right .
m e010 [ s] : So , we ’d have our own lit t le [ vocalsound] t hings so t hat
whenever we needed one , we ’d just use t he ont ology t o get t he t ype
,
m e012 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ fe] : and t hen would hash or what ev er we do t o say , " ah !
m e010 [ s:s^ fe] : If it ’s t hat t ype of t hing , and we want it s EVA vect or ,
pppt − pppt ! [ com m ent ] it ’s t hat . "
m e010 [ s] : So , I I t hink we can handle t hat .
m e010 [ s] : And t hen [ disfm arker] But , t he com binat ion funct ions ,
and whet her we can put t hose in Java Bay es , and all t hat sort of st uff ,
is , uh [ disfm arker] is t he bigger deal .
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s] : I t hink t hat ’s where we hav e t o get t echnically clever .
m e012 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ cs] : We could just st eal t he classes in JavaBayes and t hen
int erface t o t hem wit h our own code .
m e010 [ s.%−] : Well , I m e ye [ nonvocalsound] eh , yeah , t he
[ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s] : That requires underst anding t he classes in JavaBayes , I
guess . @ @ .
m e010 [ s^ aa|s^ ba] : Yeah , I m ean , it ’s , uh , e e e e e cut e .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , you ’ve been around enough t o [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ rt ] : Just ?
m e003 [ s.%−] : Well , it depends on [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ df] : I m ean , t here ’s t his huge package which [ disfm arker]
which m ay or m ay not be consist ent
m e010 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ f] : you know .
m e010 [ s^ aa|s^ cs] : But , yeah , we could look at it .
m e003 [ s^ df.%−−] : Well , I was j
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK . Yeah .
m e010 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e010 [ s.%−−] : It ’s b It [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s.%−−] : It ’s an int er sort of a kind of a [ disfm arker] it

m ake a different kind of dat a st ruct ure t o st ick in t here [ disfm arker] "
m e003 [ s] : Well , no , but t hat just m eans t here ’s a prot ocol ,
m e003 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e003 [ s.%−] : That you could [ disfm arker]

m e010 [ s] : It m ay or m ay not .
m e010 [ s^ no^ rt ] : I don’t know .
m e010 [ qh] : That ’s t he quest ion is " t o what ext ent does it allow us t o
put in t hese G funct ions ? "
m e010 [ s^ no] : And I don’t know .
m e003 [ s^ ar|s^ df.%−−] : Well , no , but [ disfm arker] I m ean [ disfm arker]
What I uh t he [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : So y ou could have four different Bayes − net s t hat you ’re
running ,
m e003 [ s^ e] : and t hen run your own [ disfm arker] writ e your own
funct ion t hat would t ake t he out put of t hose four ,
m e003 [ s^ e] : and m ake your own " G funct ion " , is what I was say ing .
m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : Yeah , t hat ’s fine
m e010 [ s^ df] : if it ’s [ disfm arker] if it com es only at t he end .
m e010 [ qh] : But suppose you want it em bedded ?
m e003 [ s] : Well , t hen you ’d have t o break all of your Bayes − net s
int o sm aller Bayes − net s ,
m e003 [ s.%−] : wit h all t he [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ %−−] : Oh , t hat [ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : Yeah , t hat ’s a t ruly horrible way t o do d it .
m e010 [ s.%−] : One would hope [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ bk|s^ df.%−] : Yeah , but I ’m just [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s^ bk|s^ na] : Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , you bet .
m e010 [ s:s] : But , at t hat point you m ay say , " hey , Java Bayes isn’t
t he only package in t own .
m e010 [ s:s] : Let ’s see if t here ’s anot her package t hat ’s , eh , m ore
civ ilized about t his . "
m e012 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e010 [ s] : Now , Srini is wort h t alking t o on t his ,
m e012 [ b.%] : Mm m .
m e010 [ s^ df] : cuz he said t hat he act ually did hack som e com bining
funct ions int o
m e012 [ b] : Ah !
m e010 [ s] : But he doesn’t rem em ber [ disfm arker] at least when I
t alked t o him , he didn’t rem em ber [ vocalsound] whet her it was an e
an easy t hing , a nat ural t hing , or whet her he had t o do som e
v iolence t o it t o m ake it work .
m e010 [ fh] : Uh .
m e010 [ s^ df] : But he did do it .
m e012 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s^ no] : I don’t see why t he , uh , com bining f funct ions have t o
be direct ly hacked int o
m e012 [ s^ df] : I m ean , t hey ’re used t o creat e t ables
m e012 [ s] : so we can just m ake our own lit t le funct ions t hat creat e
t ables in XML .

m e010 [ s^ na] : Well , I say t hat ’s one way t o do it , is [ disfm arker] is
t o just convert it int int o a [ disfm arker] int o a C P T t hat you zip
[ disfm arker]
m e010 [ s^ bd] : It ’s blown up ,
m e010 [ s^ bd] : and is a [ disfm arker] it ’s , uh [ disfm arker] it ’s huge ,
m e010 [ s^ df] : but [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] it doesn’t require any

m e012 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s^ nd.%−−] : I don’t t hink [ disfm arker] I m ean , t he fact t hat it

m e012 [ s] : I m ean , OK .
m e012 [ s|qy ^ d^ f^ g] : So say it blows up , right ?
m e012 [ s] : So t here ’s , like , t he you know , t en , f t en , fift een , uh ,

m e012 [ s] : It ’s gonna be like , t wo t o t he [ disfm arker] t hat ,
m e012 [ s] : which isn’t so bad .
m e010 [ s^ na] : I I underst and .
m e010 [ s^ df.%−−] : I ’m just saying t ha t hat w
m e010 [ s] : That was wi t hat was m y not e .
m e010 [ s^ e] : The lit t le not e I sent said t hat .
m e012 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s:s] : It said , " Here ’s t he way y ou ’d t ake t he logical f G

m e012 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e010 [ s] : I m ean t hat [ disfm arker] t he Max − t he Evidence −

m e010 [ s^ cs] : So we could do t hat .
m e010 [ s^ am ^ cs] : And m aybe t hat ’s what we ’ll do .
