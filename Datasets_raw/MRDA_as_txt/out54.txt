m e018 [ s^ bk|s^ t ^ t c] : OK . We ’re on .
m e013 [ fg|s^ t ^ t c] : OK , so uh [ v ocalsound] had som e int erest ing m ail
from uh Dan Ellis .
m e013 [ s] : Act ually , I t hink he [ disfm arker] he [ vocalsound]
redirect ed it t o ev erybody also
m e013 [ s] : so uh [ v ocalsound] t he PDA m ikes uh have a big bunch of
energy at [ disfm arker] at uh five hert z
m e013 [ fh] : uh
m e013 [ s] : where t his cam e up was t hat uh I was showing off t hese
wav e form s t hat we have on t he web
m e013 [ fh|s] : and [ disfm arker] and uh [ v ocalsound] I just sort of
hadn’t not iced t his , but t hat [ disfm arker] t he m ajor , m ajor com ponent
in t he wave [ disfm arker] in t he second wave form in t hat pair of wave
form s is act ually t he air condit ioner .
m e026 [ x ] : Huh .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s] : I [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] I have t o be m ore careful
about using t hat as a [ disfm arker] as a [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] as a
good illust rat ion ,
m e013 [ s] : uh , in fact it ’s not , of uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] of t he
effect s of room rev erberat ion .
m e013 [ s] : It is isn’t a bad illust rat ion of t he effect s of uh room noise .
[ v ocalsound] on [ disfm arker] on uh som e m ikes
m e013 [ fh] : uh but
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen we had t his ot her discussion about um
[ v ocalsound] whet her t his affect s t he dynam ic range ,
m e013 [ s] : cuz I know , alt hough we st art off wit h t hirt y t wo bit s , you
end up wit h uh sixt een bit s
m e013 [ qo] : and [ vocalsound] you know , are we get t ing hurt t here ?
m e013 [ s.x ] : But uh Dan is pret t y confident t hat we ’re not , t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat quant izat ion error is not [ disfm arker] is st ill not a
significant [ v ocalsound] fact or t here .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s] : So t here was a quest ion of whet her we should change
t hings here ,
m e013 [ s] : whet her we should [ vocalsound] change a capacit or on
t he input box for t hat
m e013 [ s.%−] : or whet her we should
m e018 [ fg|s^ bu] : Yeah , he suggest ed a sm aller capacit or ,
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e018 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : For t he P D
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : But t hen I had som e ot her uh t hing discussions wit h him

m e013 [ s] : and t he feeling was [ vocalsound] once we st art m onk
m onkeying wit h t hat , uh , m any ot her problem s could ha happen .
m e013 [ s] : And addit ionally we [ disfm arker] we already have a lot of
dat a t hat ’s been collect ed wit h t hat ,
m e013 [ fh] : so .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : A sim ple t hing t o do is
m e013 [ s] : he [ disfm arker] he [ disfm arker] he has a [ disfm arker] I
forget if it [ disfm arker] t his was in t hat m ail or in t he following m ail ,
m e013 [ s] : but he has a [ disfm arker] a sim ple filt er , a digit al filt er
t hat he suggest ed .
m e013 [ s] : We just run over t he dat a before we deal wit h it .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fg|s^ t c] : um The ot her t hing t hat I don’t know t he answer t o ,
but when people are using Feacalc here , uh whet her t hey ’re using it
wit h t he high − pass filt er opt ion or not .
m e013 [ s] : And I don’t know if anybody knows .
m e006 [ h|s^ cs^ no^ rt ] : Um . [ vocalsound] I could go check .
m e013 [ fh] : But .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So when we ’re doing all t hese t hings using our
soft ware t here is [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : um if it ’s [ disfm arker] if it ’s based on t he RASTA − PLP
program , [ vocalsound] which does bot h PLP and RASTA − PLP
[ v ocalsound] um t hen [ vocalsound] uh t here is an opt ion t here which
t hen com es up t hrough t o Feacalc which [ vocalsound] um allows you
t o do high − pass filt ering
m e013 [ s] : and in general we like t o do t hat , because of t hings like
t his
m e013 [ s] : and [ v ocalsound] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s pret t y [ disfm arker]
it ’s not a very sev ere
m e013 [ s] : filt er . Doesn’t affect speech frequencies ,
m e013 [ s] : ev en pret t y low speech frequencies , at all ,
m e013 [ %−−] : but it ’s
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : What ’s t he [ pause] cut − off frequency it used ?
m e013 [ h] : Oh .
m e013 [ s^ no] : I don’t know
m e013 [ s^ df] : I wrot e t his a while ago
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is it like t went y ?
m e013 [ s^ am ] : Som et hing like t hat .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean I t hink t here ’s som e effect above t went y
m e013 [ s] : but it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
m ild .

m e013 [ s] : So , I m ean it probably [ disfm arker] t here ’s probably som e
effect up t o a hundred hert z or som et hing but it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
pret t y m ild .
m e013 [ qr.%−−] : I don’t know in t he [ disfm arker] in t he STRUT
im plem ent at ion of t he st uff is t here a high − pass filt er or a pre pre −
em phasis or som et hing in t he [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ h|s^ am ] : Uh . I t hink we use a pre − em phasis .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So . We [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] we want t o go and
check t hat in i for anyt hing t hat we ’re going t o use t he P D
m e013 [ s] : A m ike for . [ vocalsound] uh He says t hat t here ’s a pret t y
good roll off in t he PZM m ikes
m e013 [ s] : so [ v ocalsound] we don’t need [ disfm arker] need t o worry
about t hem one way or t he ot her
m e013 [ s] : but if we do m ake use of t he cheap m ikes , [ vocalsound]
uh we want t o be sure t o do t hat [ disfm arker] t hat filt ering before we
[ v ocalsound] process it .
m e013 [ %−−] : And t hen again if it ’s
m e013 [ s] : uh depending on t he opt ion t hat t he [ disfm arker] our
[ disfm arker] our soft ware is being run wit h , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s quit e
possible t hat ’s already being t aken care of .
m e013 [ s] : uh But I also have t o pick a different pict ure t o show t he
effect s of rev erberat ion .
m e013 [ fh] : uh
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Did som ebody not ice it during your t alk ?
m e013 [ h|s^ ar] : uh No .
m e018 [ b] : Huh .
m e013 [ %−−] : Well .
m e013 [ fh] : uh
m e013 [ fg|s] : Well . If t hey m ade out put
m e013 [ s^ ba] : t hey were [ disfm arker] t hey were , you know
[ disfm arker] t hey were nice .
m e018 [ qy ^ 2^ bu^ d] : Didn’t say any t hing ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But . [ vocalsound] I m ean t he t hing is it was
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : since I was t alking about reverberat ion and showing
t his t hing t hat was noise , it wasn’t a good m at ch ,
m e013 [ s] : but it cert ainly was st ill uh an indicat ion of t he fact t hat
y ou get noise wit h dist ant m ikes .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : uh It ’s just not a great ex am ple because not only isn’t
it rev erberat ion but it ’s a noise t hat we definit ely know what t o do .
m e013 [ s] : So , I m ean , it doesn’t t ake deep [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] a new [ disfm arker] bold new m et hods t o get rid of uh five
hert z noise ,
m e013 [ fh] : so .

m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : um [ v ocalsound] uh But .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : So it was [ disfm arker] it was a bad exam ple in t hat way
,
m e013 [ s] : but it ’s [ disfm arker] it st ill is [ disfm arker] it ’s t he real
t hing t hat we did get out of t he m icrophone at dist ance ,
m e013 [ s] : so it wasn’t [ vocalsound] it w it w wasn’t wrong it was
inappropriat e .
m e013 [ fh] : So . [ v ocalsound] So uh , but uh ,
m e013 [ fg|s:s] : Yeah , som eone not iced it lat er point ed it out t o m e ,
and I went " oh , m an .
m e013 [ s:qw] : Why didn’t I not ice t hat ? "
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : um . So . [ vocalsound] um
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So I t hink we ’ll change our [ disfm arker] our pict ure on
t he web , when we ’re @ @ .
m e013 [ s] : One of t he t hings I was [ disfm arker] I m ean , I was t rying t o
t hink about what [ disfm arker] what ’s t he best [ vocalsound] way t o
show t he difference an and I had a couple of t hought s
m e013 [ s^ ba] : one was , [ vocalsound] t hat spect rogram t hat we
show [ vocalsound] is O K ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : but t he t hing is [ vocalsound] t he eyes uh and t he
[ v ocalsound] t he brain behind t hem are so good at picking out
pat t erns [ vocalsound] from [ disfm arker] from noise [ vocalsound] t hat
in first glance
m e013 [ s^ e] : you look at t hem it doesn’t seem like it ’s t hat bad
m e013 [ s^ df] : uh because t here ’s m any feat ures t hat are st ill
preserved .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : So one t hing t o do m ight be t o just t ake a piece of t he
spec uh of t he spect rogram where you can see [ vocalsound] t hat
som et hing looks different ,
m e013 [ s] : an and blow it up , and have t hat be t he part t hat ’s
[ disfm arker] just t o show as well .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m . Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ f] : You know .
m e013 [ s] : i i Som e t hings are going t o be hurt .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : um [ vocalsound] Anot her , I was t hinking of was um
[ v ocalsound] t aking som e spect ral slices ,
m e013 [ s^ cs^ e] : like uh [ disfm arker] like we look at wit h t he
recognizer ,
m e013 [ s^ cs^ e] : and look at t he spect rum or cepst rum t hat you get
out of t here ,
m e013 [ s] : and t he [ disfm arker] t he uh , um , [ vocalsound] t he
rev erberat ion uh does m ake it [ disfm arker] does change t hat .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .

m e013 [ s] : And so m aybe [ disfm arker] m ay be t hat would be m ore
obvious .
m e026 [ qy^ bu^ d^ g^ rt ] : Spect ral slices ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e026 [ qw^ rt ] : W w what d what do you m ean ?
m e013 [ s] : Well , I m ean um all t he recognizers look at fram es .
m e018 [ s^ e] : So like one inst ant in t im e .
m e013 [ s.%−] : So t hey [ disfm arker] t hey look at [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : Yeah , look at a [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So it ’s ,
m e013 [ b] : yeah ,
m e013 [ s] : at one point in t im e or uh t went y [ disfm arker] over t went y
m illiseconds or som et hing , [ vocalsound] you have a spect rum or a
cepst rum .
m e026 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : That ’s what I m eant by a slice .
m e026 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−] : And [ v ocalsound] if you look at [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ cs^ j] : You could just [ disfm arker] you could just t hrow up ,
y ou know , uh [ vocalsound] t he uh [ disfm arker] som e MFCC feat ure
v ect ors .
m e018 [ s^ j] : You know , one from one , one from t he ot her , and t hen
, you know , you can look and see how different t he num bers are .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Right . Well , t hat ’s why I saying
m e018 [ s^ df] : I ’m just kidding .
m e013 [ s] : eit her [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] Well , eit her spect rum or
cepst rum
m e013 [ s.%−] : but [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] but I t hink t he t hing is
y ou wanna [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : I don’t m ean a graph .
m e013 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e018 [ s^ e] : I m ean t he act ual num bers .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh . I see .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : That would be lovely ,
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : y eah .
m e018 [ s^ j:qy ^ d] : " See how different t hese [ vocalsound] sequences
of num bers are ? "
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ j] : Or I could just add t hem up and get a different t ot al .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : It ’s not t he square .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m e013 [ qw] : Uh . What else [ disfm arker] wh what ’s [ disfm arker] what
else is going on ?
m n007 [ h|s^ bk] : Uh , yeah .
m n007 [ fg|s] : Yeah , at first I had a rem ark
m n007 [ s] : why [ disfm arker] I am wondering why t he PDA is always so
far .
m n007 [ s] : I m ean we are alway s m eet ing at t he [ vocalsound]
beginning of t he t able and [ vocalsound] t he PDA ’s t here .
m e013 [ h|s] : Uh . I guess cuz we haven’t want ed t o m ove it .
m e013 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : We [ disfm arker] we could [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
we could m ove us ,
m n007 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Yeah ?
m e013 [ fh] : and .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : That ’s right .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Well , anyway .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ fg|%−−] : Yeah , so .
m n007 [ h|s^ rt ] : Uh . Since t he last m eet ing we ’ve [ disfm arker] we ’ve
t ried t o put t oget her um [ vocalsound] t he clean low − pass um
downsam pling , upsam pling , I m ean ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Uh t he new filt er t hat ’s replacing t he LDA filt ers ,
m n007 [ s] : and also [ vocalsound] t he um delay issue
m n007 [ %−−] : so t hat [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : We considered t h t he [ disfm arker] t he delay issue on t he
[ disfm arker] for t he on − line norm alizat ion .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ s] : So we ’v e put t oget her all t his
m n007 [ s^ ba^ rt ] : and t hen we have result s t hat are not um
[ v ocalsound] [ v ocalsound] very im pressiv e .
m n007 [ s] : Well , t here is no [ vocalsound] real im provem ent .
m e013 [ s^ bu^ df] : But it ’s not wer worse
m n007 [ s.%−] : It ’s not [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu^ df] : and it ’s bet t er [ disfm arker] bet t er lat ency ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ ba] : Well . Act ually it ’s bet t er .
m n007 [ s] : It seem s bet t er when we look at t he m ism at ched case
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : but [ vocalsound] I t hink we are like [ disfm arker] like
cheat ed here by t he [ disfm arker] t h t his problem
m n007 [ s] : t hat [ v ocalsound] uh in som e cases when you m odify slight

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .

m n007 [ fh] : So .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Well . The ot her sy st em are for inst ance .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : For It alian is at sev ent y − eight [ vocalsound] percent

m n007 [ s] : But I don’t t hink it indicat es som et hing , really .
m n007 [ s.%−] : I don’t [ disfm arker] I don’t t hink it m eans t hat t he new

m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ %−−] : or [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s.%−−] : It ’s sim ply t he fact t hat [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %−] : Well .
m e013 [ s.%−] : Well , t he t est would be if you t hen t ried it on one of t he

m n007 [ %−−] : Y
m e013 [ fg|s^ bu] : Right . So t his was It alian ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So t hen if you t ake y our changes
m n007 [ s] : It ’s sim ilar for ot her t est set s
m e013 [ %−] : and t hen [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : but I m ean [ vocalsound] from t his se sevent y − eight um
percent recognit ion rat e syst em , [ vocalsound] I could change t he
t ransit ion probabilit ies for t he [ disfm arker] t he first HMM and [ pause] it
will end up t o eight y − nine also .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ s] : By using point five inst ead of point six , point four
[ v ocalsound] as in t he [ disfm arker] t he HTK script .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ b^ rt ] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh|%−−] : So . Well . That ’s [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fg|s] : Yeah I looked at um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] looked at
t he result s when St ephane did t hat
m n007 [ %−] : Well .
m n007 [ fh.%] : Eh uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : and it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s really wo really happens .
m n007 [ s^ aa^ m ] : This really happens .
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : I m ean t h t he only difference is you change t he self −

m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : and it causes t en percent difference in t he word error rat e
.
m e013 [ s^ bu] : A t ent h of a per cent .
m n007 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Even t ent h of a percent ?

m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : From point [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Well , we t ried [ disfm arker] we t ried point one ,
m e018 [ s^ fa] : I [ disfm arker] I ’m sorry
m e018 [ s] : f for point [ disfm arker] from [ disfm arker] You change at
point one
m n007 [ b] : y eah .
m n007 [ b.%] : Hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh !
m e018 [ s] : and n not t ent h of a percent , one t ent h ,
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : alright ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : Um so from point five [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : so from point six t o point five and you get t en percent
bet t er .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : And it ’s [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] I t hink it ’s what you
basically hy pot hesized in t he last m eet ing [ vocalsound] about uh it just
being v ery [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s.%−−] : and I t hink you m ent ioned t his in your em ail t oo
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm m , y eah .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : it ’s just very um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : y ou know get st uck in som e local m inim um
m e018 [ s] : and t his t hing t hrows you out of it I guess .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qw] : Well , what ’s [ disfm arker] what are [ disfm arker]
according t o t he rules what [ disfm arker] what are we supposed t o do
about t he t ransit ion probabilit ies ?
m e013 [ qr] : Are t hey supposed t o be point five or point six ?
m e018 [ s.%−−] : I t hink you ’re not allowed t o [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ na] : That ’s supposed t o be point six , for t he self − loop .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bu^ m ] : Point [ disfm arker] It ’s supposed t o be point six .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : But changing it t o point five I t hink is [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : which gives you m uch bet t er result s ,
m e018 [ s] : but t hat ’s [ vocalsound] not allowed .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m ] : But not allowed ?
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah . OK .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fg|s^ aap^ df] : Yeah , but even if y ou use point five , I ’m not

m n007 [ s.%−−] : on ot her t est set or it

m e018 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fg|s^ bu] : Right . We only t est ed it on t he [ disfm arker] t he
m edium m ism at ch ,
m n007 [ s] : on t he ot her t raining set , I m ean .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d.%−−] : You said on t he ot her cases you didn’t not ice
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s.%−−] : But . I t hink ,
m n007 [ s^ aa] : yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : I t hink t he reason is ,
m n007 [ s.%−−] : y eah , I not I [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ df] : it was in m y m ail I t hink also , [ vocalsound] is t he fact
t hat t he m ism at ch is t rained only on t he far m icrophone .
m n007 [ s] : Well , in [ disfm arker] for t he m ism at ched case everyt hing is
um using t he far m icrophone t raining and t est ing ,
m n007 [ s] : whereas for t he highly m ism at ched , t raining is done on
t he close m icrophone
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : so [ v ocalsound] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s clean speech
basically
m n007 [ s] : so y ou don’t have t his problem of local m inim a probably
m n007 [ s] : and for t he well − m at ch , it ’s a m ix of close m icrophone
and dist ant m icrophone
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Well .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : I did not ice uh som et hing [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : So t h I t hink t he m ism at ch is t he m ore difficult for t he
t raining part .
m e018 [ s] : Som ebody , I t hink it was Morgan , suggest ed at t he last
m eet ing t hat I act ually count t o see [ vocalsound] how m any
param et ers and how m any fram es .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : And t here are uh alm ost one point eight m illion fram es of
t raining dat a
m e018 [ s] : and less t han fort y t housand param et ers in t he baseline
sy st em .
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : So it ’s v ery , very few param et ers com pared t o how m uch
t raining dat a .
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Well . Yes .
m e013 [ %−−] : So .
m e013 [ s] : And t hat [ disfm arker] t hat says t hat we could have lot s
m ore param et ers act ually .

m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : I did one quick ex perim ent just t o m ake sure I had
ev ery t hing worked out
m e018 [ s.%−−] : and I just [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] uh f for m ost of t he
um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : For [ disfm arker] for all of t he digit m odels , t hey end up
at t hree m ix t ures per st at e .
m e018 [ s] : And so I just did a quick experim ent , where I changed it so
it went t o four
m e018 [ s] : and um [ vocalsound] it it [ disfm arker] it didn’t have a r any
significant effect at t he uh m edium m ism at ch and high m ism at ch cases
m e018 [ s] : and it had [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] it was just barely
significant for t he well − m at ched
m e018 [ s] : bet t er .
m e018 [ s] : Uh so I ’m r gonna run t hat again but [ vocalsound] um wit h
m any m ore uh m ix t ures per st at e .
m e013 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah . Cuz at fort y t hou I m ean you could you could
have
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s] : Yeah , easily four t im es as m any [ vocalsound]
param et ers .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ rt .%−−] : And I t hink also [ v ocalsound] just seeing what we
saw [ v ocalsound] uh in t erm s of t he expect ed durat ion of t he silence
m odel ?
m e018 [ s^ rt .%−−] : when we did t his t weaking of t he self − loop ?
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : The silence m odel expect ed durat ion was really different .
m e018 [ s] : And so in t he case where [ vocalsound] um [ vocalsound] it
had a bet t er score , t he silence m odel expect ed durat ion was m uch
longer .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : So it was like [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] it was a bet t er
m at ch .
m e018 [ s] : I t hink [ vocalsound] you know if we m ake a bet t er silence
m odel I t hink t hat will help a lot t oo
m e018 [ s] : um for a lot of t hese cases
m e018 [ fh] : so
m e018 [ s] : but one one t hing I [ disfm arker] I want ed t o check out
before I increased t he um [ vocalsound] num ber of m ixt ures per st at e
was [ v ocalsound] uh [ vocalsound] in t heir [ vocalsound] default t raining
script t hey do an init ial set of t hree re − est im at ions
m e018 [ s] : and t hen t hey built t he silence m odel
m e018 [ s] : and t hen t hey do sev en it erat ions t hen t he add m ixt ures

m e018 [ s] : and t hey do anot her sev en t hen t hey add m ixt ures
m e018 [ s] : t hen t hey do a final set of seven and t hey quit .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Seven seem s like a lot t o m e
m e018 [ s^ df] : and it also m akes t he experim ent s go t ake a really long
t im e
m e018 [ s] : I m ean t o do one t urn − around of t he well m at ched case
t akes like a day .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : And so [ vocalsound] you know in t rying t o run t hese
ex perim ent s I not ice , you know , it ’s difficult t o find m achines , you
know , com put e t he run on .
m e018 [ s] : And so one of t he t hings I did was I com piled HTK for t he
Linux [ vocalsound] m achines
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : cuz we have t his one from IBM t hat ’s got like fiv e
processors in it ?
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s] : and so now I ’m [ disfm arker] you can run st uff on t hat and
t hat really helps a lot because now we ’ve got [ vocalsound] you know ,
ex t ra m achines t hat we can use for com put e .
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : And if [ disfm arker] I ’m do running an experim ent right
now where I ’m changing t he num ber of it erat ions ? [ vocalsound] from
sev en t o t hree ?
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : just t o see how it affect s t he baseline syst em .
m e018 [ s^ df] : And so if we can get away wit h just doing t hree , we
can do [ v ocalsound] m any m ore experim ent s m ore quickly .
m e018 [ s^ df] : And if it ’s not a [ disfm arker] a huge difference from
running wit h sev en it erat ions , [ vocalsound] um , you know , we should
be able t o get a lot m ore experim ent s done .
m n007 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ s] : And so . I ’ll let you know what [ disfm arker] what happens
wit h t hat .
m e018 [ s] : But if we can [ vocalsound] you know , run all of t hese back
− ends f wit h m any fewer it erat ions and [ vocalsound] on Linux boxes we
should be able t o get a lot m ore experim ent ing done .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ s] : So I want ed t o experim ent wit h cut t ing down t he num ber of
it erat ions before I [ v ocalsound] increased t he num ber of Gaussians .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ fa] : Sorry .
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : So um , how ’s it going on t he [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fg.%] : Um .

m e013 [ s] : So . You [ disfm arker] you did som e t hings .
m e013 [ s] : They didn’t im prove t hings in a way t hat convinced you you
’d subst ant ially im proved anyt hing .
m n007 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : But t hey ’re not m aking t hings worse and we have
reduced lat ency ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : But act ually [ disfm arker] um act ually it seem s t o do a
lit t le bit worse for t he well − m at ched case
m n007 [ s.%−−] : and we just not iced t hat [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Yeah , act ually t he way t he final score is com put ed is
quit e funny .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : It ’s not a m ean of word error rat e .
m n007 [ s] : It ’s not a weight ed m ean of word error rat e ,
m n007 [ s] : it ’s a weight ed m ean of im provem ent s .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ %−−] : So .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Which m eans t hat [ vocalsound] act ually t he weight on
t he well − m at ched is [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Well I well what what [ disfm arker] What happened is t hat if
y ou hav e a sm all im provem ent or a sm all if on t he well − m at ched case
[ v ocalsound] it will have uh huge influence on t he im provem ent
com pared t o t he reference
m n007 [ s] : because t he reference syst em is [ disfm arker] is
[ disfm arker] is quit e good for [ disfm arker] for t he well − m a well −
m at ched case also .
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So it [ disfm arker] it weight s t he im provem ent
on t he well − m at ched case really heavily com pared t o t he im provem ent
on t he ot her cases ?
m n007 [ s^ ar|s] : No , but it ’s t he weight ing of t he [ disfm arker] of t he
im provem ent
m n007 [ s] : not of t he error rat e .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fg|s] : Yeah , and it ’s hard t o im prove on t he [ disfm arker] on
t he best case ,
m e018 [ s] : cuz it ’s already so good ,
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n007 [ s^ bk|s^ aap^ rt ] : Yeah but [ pause] what I m ean is t hat you
can have a huge im provem ent on t he H [ disfm arker] HMK ’s ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : uh like five percent uh absolut e ,
m n007 [ s] : and t his will not affect t he final score alm ost [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ df^ rt ] : Uh t his will alm ost not affect t he final score because
[ v ocalsound] t his im provem ent [ disfm arker] because t he im provem ent
[ v ocalsound] uh relat ive t o t he [ disfm arker] t he baseline is sm all
[ disfm arker]

m n007 [ fh] : Uh .
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So t hey do im provem ent in t erm s of uh
accuracy ? rat her t han word error rat e ?
m n007 [ s^ m .%−−] : Uh im provem ent ?
m n007 [ s^ ar|s] : No , it ’s com pared t o t he word er it ’s im prov em ent
on t he word error rat e ,
m e013 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
m n007 [ s^ fa] : Sorry .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So if you have uh t en percent error and you get five
percent absolut e uh [ vocalsound] im provem ent t hen t hat ’s fift y
percent .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ bs] : OK . So what you ’re saying t hen is t hat if it ’s
som et hing t hat has a sm all word error rat e , [ vocalsound] t hen uh a
[ disfm arker] even a relat ively sm all im prov em ent on it , in absolut e
t erm s , [ v ocalsound] will show up as quit e [ disfm arker] quit e large in

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Is t hat what you ’re saying ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Yes .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : But yeah t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s t he
not ion of relat ive im provem ent .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Word error rat e .
m n007 [ fg|s^ arp^ df] : Sure , but when we t hink about t he weight ing ,
which is point five , point t hree , point t wo , [ vocalsound] it ’s on
absolut e on [ disfm arker] on relat ive figures ,
m n007 [ %−] : not [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ rt .%−−] : So when we look at t his error rat e
m e013 [ b^ rt ] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n007 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ba] : That ’s why I ’v e been saying we should be looking at
word error rat e uh and [ disfm arker] and not [ disfm arker] not at
[ v ocalsound] at accuracies .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m , yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m , yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : It ’s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ s] : I m ean uh we probably should have st andardized on t hat
all t he way t hrough .
m e013 [ %−−] : It ’s just [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fg] : Well .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : I m ean , it ’s not [ disfm arker] it ’s not t hat different ,
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e018 [ s] : I m ean , just subt ract t he accuracy .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah
m e018 [ %−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ arp^ df] : but you ’re [ disfm arker] but when you look at t he
num bers , your sense of t he relat iv e size of t hings is quit e different .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh . Oh , I see .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : If you had ninet y percent uh correct [ vocalsound] and
five percent ,
m e013 [ s] : five ov er ninet y doesn’t look like it ’s a big difference ,
m e013 [ s^ ba] : but [ vocalsound] five over t en is [ disfm arker] is big .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So just when we were looking at a lot of num bers and
[ v ocalsound] get t ing sense of what was im port ant .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see . I see .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : That m akes sense .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ fg] : Well anyway
m n007 [ fh] : uh .
m n007 [ fh] : So .
m n007 [ fh|s^ rt ] : Yeah . So it hurt s a lit t le bit on t he well − m at ch
m n007 [ fh] : and
m n007 [ s^ bk] : yeah .
m e013 [ qw] : What ’s a lit t le bit ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Like [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ no] : Like , it ’s difficult t o say
m n007 [ s.%−−] : because again
m n007 [ fh|s.%−−] : um [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] I ’m not sure I have
t he
m n007 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ rt ^ t c] : Hey Morgan ?
m e018 [ qy.%−] : Do you rem em ber t hat Signif program t hat we used t o

m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Is t hat st ill valid ?
m e018 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I ’ve been using t hat .

m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , it was act ually updat ed .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : Uh . [ vocalsound] Jeff updat ed it som e years ago
m e018 [ qh^ d] : Oh , it was .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : Oh , I shoul
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and uh cleaned it up m ade som e t hings
bet t er in it .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ %−] : So .
m e018 [ s] : I should find t hat new one .
m e018 [ s] : I just use m y old one from [ vocalsound] ninet y − t wo or
what ev er
m e013 [ s] : Yeah , I ’m sure it ’s not t hat different
m e013 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] but he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] he uh
[ disfm arker] he was a lit t le m ore rigorous , as I recall .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ b] : Right .
m n007 [ s^ t c] : So it ’s around , like , point five .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : No , point six [ com m ent ] uh percent absolut e on It alian
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Worse .
m n007 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Worse , yep .
m e013 [ qw] : Out of what ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean . s
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Uh well we st art from ninet y − four point sixt y − four ,
m n007 [ s] : and we go t o ninet y − four point O four .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So t hat ’s six [ disfm arker] six point t h
m n007 [ fh] : Uh .
m e018 [ s^ bc] : Ninet y − t hree point six four ,
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e018 [ s] : is t he baseline .
m n007 [ s^ ar|s^ rt ] : Oh , no , I ’ve ninet y − four .
m n007 [ s] : Oh , t he baseline , you m ean .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : Well I don’t [ disfm arker] I ’m not t alking about t he baseline

m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh . Oh .
m n007 [ %−−] : I

m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n007 [ fh] : Oh yeah .
m n007 [ s] : For Finnish , we st art t o ninet y − t hree point eight − four
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : and we go t o ninet y − t hree point sevent y − four .
m n007 [ s] : And for Spanish we are [ disfm arker] we were at ninet y −

m n007 [ s] : and we go t o ninet y − t hree − s point sixt y one .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : OK , so we are get t ing hurt som ewhat .
m n007 [ %−] : So .
m e013 [ qy.%−−] : And is t hat
m e013 [ qw.%−−] : wh what [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy.%−−] : do you know what piece [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e013 [ qy.%−] : do you know what pie
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : I guess [ disfm arker] I guess it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s t he filt er .
m n007 [ s^ df^ rt ] : Because nnn , well uh we don’t have com plet e

m n007 [ s^ rt ] : but t he filt er [ disfm arker] So t he filt er wit h t he short er

m n007 [ %−−] : which [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %−−] : And ,

m n007 [ s] : And t he ot her t hings , like um [ vocalsound] downsam pling

m e018 [ %−] : I ’m [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ s^ t c] : I ’m really confused about som et hing .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : If we saw t hat m aking a sm all change like , you know ,
a t ent h , t o t he self − loop had a huge effect , [ vocalsound] can we
really m ake any conclusions about differences in t his st uff ?
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ bk|%−−] : Yeah t hat ’s t h
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ df] : I m ean , especially when t hey ’re t his sm all .
m e018 [ %−−] : I m ean .
m n007 [ s] : I t hink we can be com plet ely fooled by t his t hing ,
m n007 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bd^ no] : I don’t know .
m e013 [ fg|s^ am ] : Well , yeah .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : So . There is first t his t hing ,
m n007 [ %−−] : and t hen t he [ disfm arker]

m n007 [ fh|s^ rt ] : y eah , I com put ed t he um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
like , t he confidence level on t he different t est set s .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : And for t he well − m at ched t hey are around um
[ v ocalsound] point six uh percent .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : For t he m ism at ched t hey are around like let ’s say one
point five percent .
m n007 [ s] : And for t he well − m uh HM t hey are also around one point

m e013 [ s^ bu] : But [ disfm arker] OK , so you [ disfm arker] t hese
[ disfm arker] t hese degradat ions you were t alking about were on t he
well − m at ched case
m n007 [ fh] : So .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy] : Uh . Do t he [ disfm arker] does t he new filt er m ake t hings
uh bet t er or worse for t he ot her cases ?
m n007 [ %−] : But .
m n007 [ s] : Uh . About t he sam e .
m n007 [ s] : It doesn’t hurt .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bu^ m ] : Doesn’t hurt , but doesn’t get a lit t le bet t er , or
som et hing .
m n007 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m ] : No .
m e013 [ fg|s] : OK , so [ vocalsound] um I guess t he argum ent one
m ight m ake is t hat , " Yeah , if you looked at one of t hese cases
[ v ocalsound] and you jiggle som et hing and it changes [ vocalsound]
t hen uh you ’re not quit e sure what t o m ake of it .
m e013 [ %−−] : But when you look across a bunch of t hese and t here ’s
som e [ disfm arker] som e pat t ern ,
m e013 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , so eh h here ’s all t he [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker]
if in all t hese different cases [ v ocalsound] it never get s bet t er , and
t here ’s significant num ber of cases where it get s worse , [ vocalsound]
t hen you ’re probably [ pause] hurt ing t hings , [ vocalsound] I would say
.
m e013 [ s] : So um [ v ocalsound] I m ean at t he very least t hat would be
a reasonably predict ion of what would happen wit h [ disfm arker] wit h a

m e013 [ qo^ d] : So I guess t he quest ion is if you can do bet t er t han
t his .
m e013 [ s] : If you can [ disfm arker] if we can approxim at e [ vocalsound]
t he old num bers while st ill keeping t he lat ency down .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .

are [ disfm arker] what ’s [ disfm arker] what ’s t he level of

m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Well , we are exchanging m ail as soon as we [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] we have significant result s .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .

[ v ocalsound] t he um [ vocalsound] spect ral subt ract ion apparent ly
from Ericsson .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ %−−] : And so .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : We are working on our side on ot her t hings like
[ v ocalsound] uh also t rying a sup spect ral subt ract ion
m n007 [ s] : but of [ disfm arker] of our own , I m ean , anot her
[ v ocalsound] spect ral subst ract ion .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s OK .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : It ’s going [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t here any furt her discussion about t his [ disfm arker]
t his idea of [ disfm arker] of hav ing som e sort of source code cont rol ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Well . For t he m om ent t hey ’re [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s.%−−] : uh everybody ’s quit e
m n007 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : There is t his Eurospeech deadline ,
m n007 [ fh] : so .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n007 [ fh] : Um . And .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fg] : But yeah .
m n007 [ s] : As soon as we have som et hing t hat ’s significant and t hat
’s bet t er t han [ disfm arker] t han what was subm it t ed ,
m n007 [ s] : we will fix [ disfm arker] fix t he syst em
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : But we ’ve not discussed it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it
[ disfm arker] t his yet ,
m n007 [ b] : y eah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s^ ba] : Sounds like a great idea
m e013 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] but I t hink t hat [ disfm arker] t hat um
[ v ocalsound] he ’s saying people are sort of scram bling for a
Eurospeech deadline .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : But t hat ’ll be uh , uh done in a week .
m e013 [ s] : So , m aybe aft er [ v ocalsound] t his next one .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ fe] : Wow !
m e018 [ s^ fe] : Already a week !
m e018 [ s^ fe] : Man !
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : You ’re right .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : That ’s am azing .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qo^ rt ] : Any bo − anybody in t he [ disfm arker] in t his group do
doing any t hing for Eurospeech ?
m n007 [ %−] : S
m e013 [ qy.%−−] : Or , is t hat what [ disfm arker] is t hat [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa|s^ na^ rt ] : Yeah we are [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] We
are t ry ing t o [ disfm arker] t o do som et hing wit h t he Meet ing Recorder
digit s ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n007 [ %−−] : and [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : But yeah .
m n007 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ ba] : And t he good t hing is t hat [ pause] t here is t his first
deadline ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : and , well , som e people from OGI are working on a
paper for t his ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : but t here is also t he um [ vocalsound] special session
about t h Aurora
m n007 [ s] : which is [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] uh which has an
ex t ended deadline .
m n007 [ fh] : So .
m n007 [ s] : The deadline is in May .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : For uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] Oh , for
Eurospeech ?
m n007 [ %−] : For t h
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So f only for t he experim ent s on Aurora .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Oh !
m n007 [ s^ ba] : So it [ disfm arker] it ’s good ,
m n007 [ b] : yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Oh , a special dispensat ion .

m e013 [ s^ ba] : That ’s great .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ qw] : Where is Eurospeech t his y ear ?
m n007 [ s] : It ’s in Denm ark .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : Aalborg [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Aalborg
m e013 [ fh] : uh
m e018 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : Oh .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So t he deadline [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw] : When ’s t he deadline ?
m n007 [ qw^ br] : Hm m ?
m e013 [ qw^ r^ rt ] : When ’s t he deadline ?
m n007 [ s] : I t hink it ’s t he t hirt eent h of May .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : That ’s great !
m e013 [ s^ r] : It ’s great .
m e013 [ s] : So we should definit ely get som et hing in for t hat .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But on m eet ing digit s , m aybe t here ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ am ] : May be .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So it would be for t he first deadline .
m e013 [ s^ am ] : May be .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b.%] : Nnn .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah . So , I m ean , I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat you could
cert ainly st art looking at [ disfm arker] at t he issue
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : uh but [ disfm arker] but uh [ vocalsound] I t hink it ’s
probably , on s from what St ephane is saying , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
unlikely t o get sort of act ive part icipat ion from t he t wo sides unt il aft er
t hey ’v e [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s.%−−] : Well I could at least [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : Well , I ’m going t o be out next week
m e018 [ s^ cs] : but I could [ pause] t ry t o look int o like t his uh CVS over
t he web .
m e018 [ s^ df] : That seem s t o be a v ery popular [ vocalsound] way of
[ pause] people dist ribut ing changes and [ disfm arker] over , you know ,
m ult iple sit es and t hings
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : so m aybe [ vocalsound] if I can figure out how do t hat
easily and t hen pass t he inform at ion on t o everybody so t hat it ’s
[ v ocalsound] you know , as easy t o do as possible
m e018 [ s^ df] : and [ disfm arker] and people don’t [ disfm arker] it won’t
int erfere wit h [ com m ent ] t heir regular work ,
m e018 [ s] : t hen m ay be t hat would be good .
m e018 [ s^ e] : And I t hink we could use it for ot her t hings around here
t oo .

m e018 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Good .
m e026 [ s^ ba] : That ’s cool .
m e026 [ s] : And if you ’re int erest ed in using CVS , I ’ve set it up here ,
m e026 [ fh] : so .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Oh great .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e026 [ fg|%−] : um j
m e018 [ s] : I used it a long t im e ago
m e018 [ s] : but it ’s been a while
m e018 [ s] : so m aybe I can ask you som e quest ions .
m e026 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e026 [ s] : So . I ’ll be away t om orrow and Monday but I ’ll be back on
Tuesday or Wednesday .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Dav e , t he ot her t hing , act ually , is [ disfm arker] is t his
business about t his wave form .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : May be you and I can t alk a lit t le bit at som e point
about [ vocalsound] com ing up wit h a bet t er [ vocalsound] uh
dem onst rat ion of t he effect s of reverberat ion for our web page ,
m e013 [ %−−] : cuz
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ v ocalsound] [ disfm arker] t he uh [ vocalsound] um
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , act ually t he [ disfm arker] t he
m e013 [ fh] : uh
m e013 [ s.%−−] : It m ade a good [ disfm arker] good audio dem onst rat ion
because when we could play t hat clip t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker]
t he really [ v ocalsound] obvious difference is t hat you can hear t wo
v oices and [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] [ v ocalsound] in t he second one
and only hear [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ cs^ j] : Maybe we could just [ pause] like , t alk int o a cup .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ j] : Som e good reverb .
m e013 [ s^ ar^ bd|s^ ba] : No , I m ean , it sound [ disfm arker] it sounds
pret t y rev erberant ,
m e013 [ s] : but I m ean you can’t [ disfm arker] when you play it back in
a room wit h a [ disfm arker] you know a big room , [ vocalsound] nobody
can hear t hat difference really .
m e026 [ b] : Yeah .
m e026 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : They hear t hat it ’s lower am plit ude and t hey hear t here ’s
a second voice ,
m e013 [ fh] : um [ vocalsound] but uh
m e013 [ s] : t hat [ disfm arker] act ually t hat m akes for a perfect ly good
dem o

m e013 [ s^ df] : because t hat ’s a real obv ious t hing , t hat you hear t wo
v oices .
m e018 [ s^ 2^ aap] : But not of reverberat ion .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e026 [ s] : A boom .
m e013 [ s^ bd] : Well t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s OK .
m e013 [ s^ co] : But for t he [ disfm arker] t he visual , just , you know , I ’d
like t o hav e uh [ vocalsound] uh , you know , t he spect rogram again ,
m e026 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df.%−−] : because you ’re [ disfm arker] you ’re [ disfm arker]
y ou ’re v isual [ vocalsound] uh abilit ies as a hum an being are so good
[ v ocalsound] you can pick out [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ df] : y ou know , you [ disfm arker] you look at t he good one ,
y ou look at t he cru t he screwed up one , and [ disfm arker] and you can
see t he feat ures in it wit hout t ry ing t o @ @ [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ na] : I not iced t hat in t he pict ures .
m e013 [ b] : yeah .
m e018 [ s.%−−:s.%−−] : I t hought " hey , you know t h " I [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s:s^ ba] : My init ial t hought was " t his is not t oo bad ! "
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ s:s] : But you have t o [ disfm arker] you know , if you look at it
closely , you see " well , here ’s a place where t his one has a big
form ant [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s^ rt ] : uh uh form ant [ disfm arker] m aj m ajor form ant s here
are [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] are m ov ing quit e a bit . "
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : And t hen you look in t he ot her one and t hey look
pract ically flat .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s:s] : So I m ean you could [ disfm arker] t hat ’s why I was
t hinking , in a sect ion like t hat , y ou could t ake a look [ disfm arker] look
at just t hat part of t he spect rogram and you could say " Oh yeah .
m e013 [ s:s] : This [ disfm arker] t his really dist ort ed it quit e a bit . "
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : The m ain t hing t hat st ruck m e in looking at t hose t wo
spect rogram s was t he difference in t he high frequencies .
m e018 [ s] : It looked like [ vocalsound] for t he one t hat was fart her
away , y ou know , it really [ disfm arker] everyt hing was at t enuat ed
m e018 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e018 [ s] : I m ean t hat was t he m ain visual t hing t hat I not iced .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ %−−] : But it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So t here are [ disfm arker] clearly are spect ral effect s .

m e013 [ s] : Since y ou ’re get t ing all t his indirect energy , t hen a lot of
it does have [ disfm arker] have uh [ vocalsound] reduced high
frequencies .
m e013 [ s] : But um t he ot her t hing is t he t em poral courses of t hings
really are changed , and [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] and uh we want t o
show t hat , in som e obvious way .
m e013 [ s] : The reason I put t he wave form s in t here was because
[ v ocalsound] uh t hey [ disfm arker] t hey do look quit e different .
m e013 [ s:s^ ba] : Uh . And so I t hought " Oh , t his is good . "
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but I [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] I just
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Aft er [ disfm arker] aft er uh t hey were put in t here I didn’t
really look at t hem anym ore ,
m e013 [ s] : cuz I just [ disfm arker] t hey were different .
m e013 [ s] : So [ vocalsound] I want som et hing t hat has a [ disfm arker]
is a m ore int erest ing explanat ion for why t hey ’re different .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e026 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e026 [ s^ cs] : So m aybe we can just subst it ut e one of t hese wave
form s
m e026 [ s] : and um [ vocalsound] t hen do som e kind of zoom in on t he
spect rogram on an int erest ing area .
m e013 [ s^ am ] : Som et hing like t hat .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e026 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s] : The ot her t hing t hat we had in t here t hat I didn’t like was
t hat um [ vocalsound] t he m ost obv ious charact erist ic of t he difference
uh when you list en t o it is t hat t here ’s a second voice ,
m e013 [ s] : and t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t he uh [ vocalsound] cut s t hat we have t here act ually
don’t correspond t o t he full wave form .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : It ’s just t he first [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : I t hink t here was som et hing where he was having som e
t rouble get t ing so m uch in ,
m e013 [ %−−] : or .
m e013 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I forget t he reason behind it .
m e013 [ s] : But [ vocalsound] it [ disfm arker] it ’s um [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] it ’s t he first six seconds or som et hing [ vocalsound] of it
m e013 [ s] : and it ’s in [ vocalsound] t he sevent h or eight h second or
som et hing where @ @ t he second voice com es in .
m e013 [ s] : So we [ disfm arker] we would like t o act ually see
[ v ocalsound] t he v oice com ing in , t oo , I t hink ,
m e026 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ df] : since t hat ’s t he m ost obvious t hing [ pause] when you
list en t o it .
m e013 [ fh] : So .

m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ fg|s^ bk^ t c] : Uh , yeah .
m n007 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : I brought som e [ disfm arker] I don’t know if [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] som e [ v ocalsound] figures here .
m n007 [ s] : Well . I st art [ disfm arker] we st art ed t o work on spect ral
subt ract ion .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : And [ v ocalsound] um [ vocalsound] t he prelim inary
result s were v ery bad .
m n007 [ s] : So t he t hing t hat we did is just t o add spect ral subt ract ion
before t his , t he Wall uh process , which cont ains LDA on − line
norm alizat ion .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ s^ ba] : And it hurt s uh a lot .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : And so we st art ed t o look at [ disfm arker] at um t hings
like t his ,
m n007 [ s.%−−] : which is ,
m n007 [ s.%−−] : well , it ’s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : So y ou have t he C − zero param et ers for one uh It alian
ut t erance .
fn002 [ s.%] : You can @ @ .
m n007 [ s] : And I plot t ed t his for t wo channels .
m n007 [ s] : Channel zero is t he close m ic m icrophone ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : and channel one is t he dist ant m icrophone .
m n007 [ s] : And it ’s perfect ly synchronized ,
m n007 [ fh] : so .
m n007 [ s] : And t he sent ence cont ain only one word , which is " Due "
m n007 [ s] : And it can’t clearly be seen .
m n007 [ qw] : Where [ disfm arker] where is it ?
m n007 [ qw] : Where is t he word ?
m e013 [ b^ rt ] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ %−−] : This is [ disfm arker] t his is ,
m e006 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ s] : oh , a plot of C − zero ,
m n007 [ %−] : So .
m e018 [ s] : t he energy .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : This is a plot of C − zero , uh when we don’t use spect ral
subst ract ion ,
m n007 [ s] : and when t here is no on − line norm alizat ion .
m n007 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : There is just som e filt ering wit h t he LDA
m n007 [ s] : and [ v ocalsound] and som e downsam pling , upsam pling .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : C − zero is t he close t alking ? [ disfm arker]

m n007 [ %−] : So .
m e018 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : uh t he close channel ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Yeah .
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ d.%−−] : and s channel one is t he [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ ba] : So C − zero is v ery clean , act ually .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Uh t hen when we apply m ean norm alizat ion it looks like
t he second figure ,
m n007 [ s] : t hough it is not .
m n007 [ s^ ba] : Which is good .
m n007 [ s] : Well , t he noise part is around zero
m n007 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] And t hen t he
t hird figure is what happens when we apply m ean norm alizat ion and
v ariance norm alizat ion .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : So .
m n007 [ s] : What we can clearly see is t hat on t he speech port ion
[ v ocalsound] t he t wo channel com e [ disfm arker] becom es very close ,
m n007 [ s.%−] : but also what happens on t he noisy port ion is t hat t he
v ariance of t he noise is [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : This is st ill being a plot of C − zero ?
m n007 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . This is st ill C − zero .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ qw] : Can I ask um what does v ariance norm alizat ion do ?
m e018 [ qw^ e^ rt ] : w What is t he effect of t hat ?
m e013 [ s^ j] : Norm alizes t he variance .
m n007 [ %−] : So it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa.%] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : It norm alized t h t he st andard deviat ion .
m e018 [ %−] : I m ean
m n007 [ %−] : So it [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : y Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : You [ disfm arker] you get an est im at e of t he st andard
deviat ion .
m e018 [ s^ ar|s] : No , I underst and t hat ,
m e018 [ s.%−] : but I m ean [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s.%−] : That ’s
m n007 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e018 [ s] : No , I underst and what it is ,
m e018 [ qw.%−−] : but I m ean , what does it [ disfm arker] what ’s
[ disfm arker] what is
m n007 [ %−] : Yeah but .
m e018 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ qw^ 2^ bu^ rt ] : What ’s t he rat ionale ?
m e018 [ %−] : We
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Yeah .
m e018 [ qw] : Why [ disfm arker] why do it ?
m n007 [ fh] : Uh .
m e013 [ s] : Well , I m ean , because [ vocalsound] everyt hing uh
[ disfm arker] If you have a syst em based on Gaussians , everyt hing is
based on m eans and variances .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So if t here ’s an overall [ v ocalsound] reason
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : You know , it ’s like uh if you were doing uh im age
processing
m e013 [ s] : and in som e of t he pict ures you were looking at , uh t here
was a lot of light
m e013 [ s] : uh and [ disfm arker] and in som e , t here was low light ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : y ou know , you would want t o adjust for t hat in order t o
com pare t hings .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And t he variance is just sort of like t he next m om ent ,
m e013 [ s^ f] : you know ?
m e013 [ qo] : So uh [ vocalsound] what if um one set of pict ures was
t aken uh so t hat t hroughout t he course it was [ disfm arker] went
t hrough daylight and night uh [ vocalsound] um um t en t im es ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : anot her t im e it went t hr
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean i is , you know , how [ disfm arker] how m uch
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] how m uch vari
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e013 [ s^ bsc] : Or no .
m e013 [ qo] : I guess a bet t er exam ple would be [ vocalsound] how
m uch of t he light was com ing in from out side
m e013 [ s] : rat her t han art ificial light .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So if it was a lot [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] if m ore was
com ing from out side , t hen t here ’d be t he bigger effect of t he
[ disfm arker] of t he [ disfm arker] of t he change in t he [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So every m ean [ disfm arker] every [ disfm arker] all
[ disfm arker] all of t he [ disfm arker] t he param et ers t hat you have ,
especially t he variances , are going t o be affect ed by t he overall
v ariance .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e018 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And so , in principle , you [ disfm arker] if you rem ove
t hat source , t hen , you know , you can [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see . OK .

m e018 [ s] : So would [ disfm arker] t he m ajor effect is [ disfm arker] t hat
y ou ’re gonna get is by norm alizing t he m eans ,
m e018 [ s.%−−] : but it m ay help [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : That ’s t he first order but [ disfm arker] t hing ,
m e018 [ s^ 2] : First − order effect s .
m e018 [ s^ 2] : And it m ay help t o do t he variance .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m ] : but t hen t he second order is [ disfm arker] is t he
v ariances
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : because , again , if you [ disfm arker] if you ’re t rying t o
dist inguish bet ween E and B
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : if it just so happens t hat t he E ’s [ vocalsound] were a
m ore [ disfm arker] you know , were recorded when [ disfm arker] when
t he energy was [ disfm arker] was [ disfm arker] was larger or som et hing
,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m . Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e018 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ s] : or t he v ariat ion in it was larger , [ vocalsound] uh t han wit h
t he B ’s , t hen t his will be [ disfm arker] give you som e [ disfm arker]
som e bias .
m e013 [ s] : So t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] it ’s rem oving t hese
sources of variabilit y in t he dat a [ v ocalsound] t hat have not hing t o do
wit h t he linguist ic com ponent .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Got cha . OK .
m e018 [ s^ fa^ t c] : Sorry t o int errupt .
m n007 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ s] : But t he [ disfm arker] t he uh [ disfm arker] but let m e as ask
[ disfm arker] ask you som et hing .
m n007 [ s.%−] : And it [ disfm arker] and t his [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : i is [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] If you have a good voice
act ivit y det ect or , isn’t [ disfm arker] isn’t it gonna pull t hat out ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Sure .
m n007 [ s^ am ] : If t hey are good .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Well what it [ disfm arker] it shows is t hat , yeah ,
perhaps a good v oice act ivit y det ect or is [ disfm arker] is good before
on − line norm alizat ion
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : and t hat ’s what uh [ v ocalsound] we ’ve already
observed .
m n007 [ %−−] : But uh ,
m n007 [ fh] : yeah ,

m n007 [ s^ ba] : voice act ivit y det ect ion is not [ vocalsound]
[ v ocalsound] an easy t hing neit her .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : But aft er you do t his , aft er you do t he variance
norm alizat ion [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ %−−] : I m ean .
m e018 [ s] : I don’t know , it seem s like t his would be a lot easier t han
t his signal t o work wit h .
m n007 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fg|s] : So . What I not ice is t hat , while I prefer t o look at t he
second figure t han at t he t hird one ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : well , because you clearly see where speech is .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : But t he problem is t hat on t he speech port ion , channel
zero and channel one are m ore different t han when you use variance
norm alizat ion where channel zero and channel one becom e closer .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : But for t he purposes of finding t he speech [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : Yeah , but here [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ d] : You ’re m ore int erest ed in t he difference bet ween
t he speech and t he nonspeech ,
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n007 [ s.%−−] : So I t hink ,
m n007 [ fh] : y eah .
m n007 [ s^ cs] : For I t h I t hink t hat it [ disfm arker] perhaps it shows
t hat [ v ocalsound] uh t he param et ers t hat t he voice act ivit y det ect or
should use [ disfm arker] uh hav e t o use should be different t han t he
param et er t hat hav e t o be used for speech recognit ion .
m e013 [ fg|s^ bs] : Yeah . So basically you want t o reduce t his effect .
m n007 [ %−] : Well , y
m e013 [ s] : So y ou can do t hat by doing t he voi voice act ivit y det ect ion
.
m e013 [ s^ bu] : You also could do it by spect uh spect ral subt ract ion
before t he [ v ocalsound] variance norm alizat ion ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n007 [ s^ aap|s^ arp] : Yeah , but it ’s not clear ,
m n007 [ b] : yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : So uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %−−] : We
m n007 [ fg] : So .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Well . It ’s just t o
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .

m n007 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] t he num ber t hat at t hat are here are
recognit ion experim ent s on It alian HM and MM [ vocalsound] wit h t hese
t wo kinds of param et ers .
m n007 [ s] : And , [ pause] well , it ’s bet t er wit h variance norm alizat ion .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So it does get bet t er even t hough it looks ugly .
m n007 [ %−−] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ qy^ rt ] : but does t his have t he voice act ivit y det ect ion in it ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ %−−] : Um .
m e006 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ fg] : So .
m e018 [ qw.%−] : Where ’s t h
m n007 [ s] : But t he fact is t hat t he voice act ivit y det ect or doesn’t work
on channel one .
m n007 [ fh] : So .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m e018 [ qw] : Where [ disfm arker] at what st age is t he voice act ivit y
det ect or applied ?
m e018 [ qr^ rt ] : Is it applied here or a aft er t he variance norm alizat ion
?
m n007 [ qw^ br] : Hm m ?
m e013 [ s^ am ] : Spect ral subt ract ion , I guess .
m n007 [ s] : It ’s applied before variance norm alizat ion .
m e018 [ qo.%−−] : or [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : So it ’s a good t hing ,
m n007 [ s^ df] : because I guess voice act ivit y det ect ion on t his should
[ disfm arker] could be worse .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e018 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is it applied all t he way back here ?
m n007 [ s.%−−] : It ’s applied t he
m n007 [ fh|%−−] : um on ,
m n007 [ s^ aa] : y eah ,
m n007 [ s] : som et hing like t his ,
m n007 [ b] : y eah .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : Maybe t hat ’s why it doesn’t work for channel one .
m n007 [ s^ am ] : Perhaps , yeah .
m e013 [ qy .%−] : Can I [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ cs] : So we could perhaps do just m ean norm alizat ion
before VAD .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Can I ask a , I m ean [ disfm arker] a sort of t op − level
quest ion ,
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : which is [ vocalsound] um " if [ disfm arker] if m ost of
what t he OGI folk are working wit h is t rying t o [ vocalsound] int egrat e
t his ot her [ disfm arker] ot her uh spect ral subt ract ion , [ vocalsound]
why are we worry ing about it ? "
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ qw^ br^ d^ m ^ rt ] : About ?
m n007 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Spect ral subt ract ion ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : It ’s just uh [ disfm arker] Well it ’s anot her [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : They are t rying t o u t o use t he um [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] t he Ericsson
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : and we ’re t rying t o use som et hing [ disfm arker]
som et hing else .
m n007 [ fh] : And .
m n007 [ fh|s.%−−] : Yeah , and also t o underst and what happens
because
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m n007 [ fh] : uh fff
m n007 [ s] : Well . When we do spect ral subt ract ion , act ually , I t hink
[ v ocalsound] t hat t his is t he [ disfm arker] t he t wo last figures .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh|s] : Um . It seem s t hat aft er spect ral subt ract ion , speech is
m ore em erging now uh [ vocalsound] t han [ disfm arker] t han before .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ qw^ br^ rt ] : Speech is m ore what ?
m n007 [ s] : Well , t he difference bet ween t he energy of t he speech
and t he energy of t he n spect ral subt rac subt ract ed noise port ion is
[ disfm arker] is larger .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ rt .%−−] : Well , if you com pare t he first figure t o t his one
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Act ually t he scale is not t he sam e ,
m n007 [ s] : but if y ou look at t he [ disfm arker] t he num bers um
[ v ocalsound] you clearly see t hat t he difference bet ween t he C − zero
of t he speech and C − zero of t he noise port ion is larger .
m n007 [ s] : Uh but what happens is t hat aft er spect ral subt ract ion ,
[ v ocalsound] you also increase t he variance of t his [ disfm arker] of C −
zero .
m n007 [ s] : And so if you apply v ariance norm alizat ion on t his , it
com plet ely sc screw everyt hing .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ %−−] : Well .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n007 [ fh] : Um . Uh . Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : So y eah .
m n007 [ s] : And what t hey did at OGI is just [ vocalsound] uh t hey don’t
use on − line norm alizat ion , for t he m om ent , on spect ral subt ract ion
m n007 [ s.%−−] : and I t hink [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : I t hink as soon as t hey will t ry on − line norm alizat ion
[ v ocalsound] t here will be a problem .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : So y eah , we ’re working on t he sam e t hing but
[ v ocalsound] I t hink
m n007 [ fh] : uh
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : wit h different [ disfm arker] different syst em
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg] : Right .
m e013 [ %−−] : I m ean , i t he
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Int ellect ually it ’s int erest ing t o work on t hings t h uh
one way or t he ot her
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : but I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m just wondering if um
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] on t he list of t hings t hat t here are t o do ,
m e013 [ s] : if t here are t hings t hat we won’t do because [ vocalsound]
we ’v e got t wo groups doing t he sam e t hing .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ %−−] : Um .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ %−−] : That ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ s^ bd^ df] : Just [ disfm arker] just asking .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Uh . I m ean , it ’s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk|%−−] : Yeah , well ,
m n007 [ fh] : uh .
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : There also could be [ disfm arker] I m ean . I can m aybe
see a reason f for bot h working on it t oo
m e018 [ s.%−−] : if [ v ocalsound] um y ou know , if [ disfm arker] if
[ disfm arker] if y ou work on som et hing else and [ disfm arker] and you
’re wait ing for t hem t o give you [ v ocalsound] spect ral subt ract ion
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : I m ean it ’s hard t o know whet her [ vocalsound] t he effect s
t hat y ou get from t he ot her experim ent s you do will [ vocalsound] carry
ov er once y ou t hen bring in t heir spect ral subt ract ion m odule .
m e018 [ s] : So it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s alm ost like everyt hing ’s held up
wait ing for t his [ vocalsound] one t hing .
m e018 [ s^ bd^ df] : I don’t know if t hat ’s t rue or not ,
m e018 [ s^ ba.%−−] : but I could see how [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e018 [ s] : May be t hat ’s what you were t hinking .

m e013 [ s^ am ] : I don’t know .
m e013 [ s] : I don’t know . [ vocalsound] I m ean , we st ill evident ly have
a lat ency reduct ion plan which [ disfm arker] which isn’t quit e what you

m e013 [ s] : That [ disfm arker] t hat seem s like one prom inent t hing .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : And t hen uh weren’t issues of [ disfm arker] of having a
[ disfm arker] a second st ream or som et hing ?
m e013 [ %−−] : That was [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−−] : Was it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : There was t his business t hat , you know , we
[ disfm arker] we could use up t he full fort y − eight hundred bit s ,
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa^ rt |s.%−−] : Yeah . But I t hink t hey ’
m n007 [ s^ df^ rt ] : I t hink we want t o work on t his .
m n007 [ s^ df^ rt ] : They also want t o work on t his ,
m n007 [ fh] : so .
m n007 [ fh] : Uh . [ vocalsound] y eah .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : We [ disfm arker] we will t ry MSG ,
m n007 [ %−−] : but um ,
m n007 [ fh] : y eah .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : And t hey are t

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Um . So .
m e013 [ fg] : OK .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Do you rem em ber when t he nex t m eet ing is supposed
t o be ?
m n007 [ s^ na] : It ’s uh in June .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : t he next uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m ] : In June .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s^ rt ] : Um . Yeah , t he ot her t hing is t hat you saw t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat m ail about uh t he VAD [ disfm arker] V A Ds perform ing

m e013 [ s.%−−] : That t hat
m e013 [ fh] : uh
m e013 [ fh] : So um .
m e013 [ qo] : This [ disfm arker] t here was t his experim ent of uh " what if
we just t ake t he baseline ? "
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : set uh of feat ures ,
m e013 [ s] : just m el cepst ra ,

m e013 [ s] : and y ou inc incorporat e t he different V A
m e013 [ s^ ba] : And it looks like t he [ disfm arker] t he French VAD is
act ually uh bet t er [ disfm arker] significant ly bet t er .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Im prov es t he baseline ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ no] : Yeah but I don’t know which VAD t hey use .
m n007 [ fh|s.%−−] : Uh . If t he use t he sm all VAD
m n007 [ s.%−−] : I t h I t hink it ’s on [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : I t hink it ’s easy t o do bet t er
m n007 [ s^ df] : because it doesn’t work at all .
m n007 [ fh] : So .
m n007 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know which [ disfm arker] which

m n007 [ s] : It ’s Prat ibha t hat [ disfm arker] t hat did t his experim ent .
fn002 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : Um . We should ask which VAD she used .
fn002 [ s^ no] : I don’t @ @ .
fn002 [ s] : He [ disfm arker] Act ually , I t hink t hat he say wit h t he good

fn002 [ s] : And t he ex perim ent was som et im e bet t er , som et im e worse
.
m n007 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah but I [ disfm arker] it ’s uh [ disfm arker] I t hink
y ou were t alking about t he ot her m ail t hat used VAD on t he reference

m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
fn002 [ s^ no] : I don’t rem em ber .
m e013 [ s] : And on t hat one , uh t he French one is [ disfm arker] was
bet t er .
m e013 [ s^ r] : It was just bet t er .
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean it was enough bet t er t hat [ disfm arker] t hat it would
[ v ocalsound] uh account for a fair am ount of t he difference bet ween

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So . [ v ocalsound] Uh .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : So if t hey have a bet t er one , we should use it .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : You know ?
m e013 [ %−−] : it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : you can’t work on ev ery t hing .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh . [ v ocalsound] Uh . Yeah .

m n007 [ fg|s] : Yeah , so we should find out if it ’s really bet t er .
m n007 [ %−−] : I m ean if it [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] com pared t o t he sm all or t he big net work
.
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : And perhaps we can easily im prove if [ disfm arker] if we put

m n007 [ s.%−−] : Because [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] as [ disfm arker] as

m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fg|s] : Yeah , m y feeling is t hat um act ually [ vocalsound] when
we look at all t he proposals , ev ev ery body is st ill using som e kind of

m n007 [ s.%−−] : and um it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ bs] : No use of pit ch uh basically .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , well , not pit ch ,
m n007 [ s] : but t o look at t he um fine [ disfm arker] at t he [ disfm arker]
at t he high re high resolut ion spect rum .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So . We don’t necessarily want t o find t he [ disfm arker] t he
pit ch of t he [ disfm arker] of t he sound
m e013 [ %−] : Well , it [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %−−] : but

m n007 [ %−−] : uh [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Cuz I have a feeling t hat [ v ocalsound] when we look
[ disfm arker] when we look at t he [ disfm arker] just at t he envelope
t here is no way y ou can t ell if it ’s voiced and unvoiced ,
m n007 [ s.%−−] : if t here is som e [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s easy in clean speech because voiced

m n007 [ fh] : and .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : So t here would be m ore ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : uh [ disfm arker] t here is t he first form ant , which is t he

m n007 [ %−−] : But ,
m n007 [ fh] : yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : When you hav e noise t here is no
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] if [ disfm arker] if you have

m n007 [ fh] : and .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah , you can m ake t hese m ist akes ,

m n007 [ s^ cs.%−−] : So I t hink t hat it [ disfm arker] it would be good
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Yeah , y eah ,
m n007 [ s^ co] : well , go [ disfm arker] go on .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt .%−−] : Uh , I was just gonna say isn’t t here [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] aren’t [ disfm arker] aren’t t here lot s of ideas for doing
v oice act iv it y , or speech − nonspeech rat her , [ com m ent ] um by
looking at [ vocalsound] um , you know , uh [ vocalsound] I guess
harm onics
m e018 [ qrr^ rt .%−−] : or looking across t im e [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Well , I t hink he was t alking about t he voiced − unvoiced ,
t hough ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : So , not t he speech − nonspeech .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : Well even wit h e

m e018 [ fh] : uh w ah
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ df] : you know , uh even wit h t he voiced − non [ pause]
v oiced − unvoiced
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e018 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s.%−−] : I t hought t hat you or [ pause] som ebody was t alking
about [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg] : Well .
m n007 [ %−] : So .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ co] : Uh yeah . B We should let him finish what he w he
was gonna say ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ co] : So go ahead .
m n007 [ h|s^ cs.%−−] : Um yeah , so yeah , I t hink if we t ry t o develop a
second st ream
m n007 [ s] : well , t here would be one st ream t hat is t he envelope and
t he second , it could be int erest ing t o hav e
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : t hat ’s [ disfm arker] som et hing t hat ’s m ore relat ed t o
t he fine st ruct ure of t he spect rum .
m n007 [ fh] : And .
m n007 [ fh|s^ no] : Yeah , so I don’t know .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : We were t hinking about like using ideas from
[ disfm arker] from Larry Saul ,
m n007 [ s^ cs.%−−] : have a good voice det ect or ,
m n007 [ s^ cs.%−−] : have a good ,
m n007 [ fh|s^ cs^ rt ] : well , voiced − speech det ect or , t hat ’s working
on [ disfm arker] on t he FFT
m n007 [ fh] : and [ vocalsound] uh
m n007 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : Larry Saul could be an idea .
m e013 [ %−] : U
m n007 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : We were are t hinking about just [ vocalsound] kind
of uh t aking t he spect rum
m n007 [ s] : and com put ing t he v ariance of [ disfm arker] of t he high
resolut ion spect rum [ vocalsound] and t hings like t his .
m e013 [ %−] : So u s u
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] So m any [ vocalsound] t ell you som et hing
about t hat .
m e013 [ s] : Uh we had a guy here som e years ago who did som e work
on [ v ocalsound] um [ vocalsound] m aking use of voicing inform at ion uh
t o [ v ocalsound] help in reducing t he noise .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah ?
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ s] : So what he was doing is basically y you [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] you do est im at e t he pit ch .
m e013 [ %−−] : And
m e013 [ fh] : um
m e013 [ s.%−−] : y ou [ disfm arker] from t hat you [ disfm arker] you
est im at e [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : or you est im at e fine harm onic st ruct ure ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : whichev
m e013 [ s] : ei eit her way ,
m e013 [ s] : it ’s m ore or less t he sam e .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But [ vocalsound] uh t he t hing is t hat um you t hen
[ v ocalsound] can get rid of t hings t hat are not [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : i if t here is st rong harm onic st ruct ure , [ vocalsound] you
can t hrow away st uff t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s non − harm onic .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : And t hat [ disfm arker] t hat is anot her way of get t ing rid
of part of t he noise
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s] : So um t hat ’s som et hing [ v ocalsound] t hat is sort of
finer ,
m e013 [ s] : brings in a lit t le m ore inform at ion t han just spect ral
subt ract ion .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : And he had som e [ disfm arker] I m ean , he did t hat sort
of in com binat ion wit h RASTA .
m e013 [ s] : It was kind of like RASTA was t aking care of convolut ional
st uff
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and he was [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and got som e [ disfm arker] som e decent
result s doing t hat .
m e013 [ s] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s anot her [ disfm arker] anot her
way .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But y eah , t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : There ’s all t hese cues .
m e013 [ %−−] : We ’v e
m n007 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : act ually back when Chuck was here we did som e voiced −
unv oiced uh [ vocalsound] classificat ion using a bunch of t hese ,

m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and
m e013 [ fh] : uh
m e013 [ s^ ba] : works OK .
m e013 [ s^ bd] : Obv iously it ’s not perfect
m e013 [ %−−] : but
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But t he t hing is t hat you can’t [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : giv en t he const raint s of t his t ask , we can’t , [ vocalsound]
in a very nice way , feed [ pause] forward t o t he recognizer t he
inform at ion [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : t he probabilist ic inform at ion t hat you m ight get about
whet her it ’s v oiced or unvoiced ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : where w we can’t you know affect t he [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] t he uh dist ribut ions or anyt hing .
m e013 [ %−−] : But we [ disfm arker] what we
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I guess we could
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Didn’t t he head dude send around t hat m essage ?
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : Yeah , I t hink y ou sent us all a copy of t he m essage ,
m e018 [ s.%−−] : where he was saying t hat [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bd^ no] : I I ’m not sure , exact ly , what t he gist of what he
was say ing ,
m e018 [ s] : but som et hing hav ing t o do wit h t he voice [ vocalsound]
act ivit y det ect or
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : and t hat it will [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t hat people
shouldn’t put t heir own in or som et hing .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : It was gonna be a [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−−] : That [ disfm arker] But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : So t hat ’s voice act ivit y det ect or as opposed t o voicing
det ect or .
m n007 [ s] : They didn’t .
m e013 [ s] : So we ’re t alking about som et hing a lit t le different .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e018 [ s^ bk|s^ fa] : Oh , I ’m sorry .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e018 [ s^ df] : I [ disfm arker] I m issed t hat .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : I guess what you could do , m aybe
m e013 [ s.%−−] : t his would be w useful , if [ disfm arker] if you have
[ disfm arker] if y ou view t he second st ream ,
m e013 [ fh|s.%−−] : y eah , before y ou [ disfm arker] before you do KLT ’s
and so fort h ,

m e013 [ s.%−−] : if you do view it as probabilit ies ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and if it ’s an independent [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So , if it ’s [ disfm arker] if it ’s uh not so m uch
[ v ocalsound] env elope − based by fine − st ruct ure − based ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : uh looking at harm onicit y or som et hing like t hat ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : um if you get a probabilit y from t hat inform at ion
m e013 [ s] : and t hen m ult iply it by [ disfm arker] you know , m ult iply by
all t he v oiced [ v ocalsound] out put s and all t he unvoiced out put s ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : you know , t hen [ vocalsound] use t hat as t he
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : uh [ disfm arker] t ake t he log of t hat
m e013 [ fh|s^ rt .%−−] : or [ vocalsound] uh pre pre uh [ disfm arker] pre −
nonlinearit y ,
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ %−] : i if [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh and do t he KLT on t he [ disfm arker] on [ disfm arker]
on t hat ,
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : t hen t hat would [ disfm arker] t hat would I guess be uh a
reasonable use of independent inform at ion .
m e013 [ s] : So m aybe t hat ’s what you m eant .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t hen t hat would be [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah , well , I was not t hinking t his [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk|s.%−−] : yeah , t his could be an
m n007 [ b] : yeah
m n007 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So you m ean have som e kind of probabilit y for
t he v t he voicing
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : and t hen use a t andem syst em
m e013 [ s^ aa|s] : R Right . So you hav e a second neural net .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : It could be pret t y sm all .
m e013 [ fg|s^ rt ] : Yeah . If you hav e a t andem syst em
m e013 [ s] : and t hen you have som e kind of [ disfm arker] it can be
pret t y sm all [ disfm arker] net [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : we used [ disfm arker] we d did som e of t his st uff .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh I [ disfm arker] I did , som e years ago ,
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : and t he [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and you use
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] t he t hing is t o use inform at ion prim arily t hat
’s different
m e013 [ s] : as y ou say , it ’s m ore fine − st ruct ure − based t han
[ disfm arker] t han envelope − based
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : uh so t hen it you [ disfm arker] you [ disfm arker] you can
pret t y m uch guarant ee it ’s st uff t hat you ’re not looking at very well
wit h t he ot her one ,

m e013 [ s] : and uh t hen you only use for t his one dist inct ion .
m n007 [ b] : Alright .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : And [ disfm arker] and so now you ’ve got a probabilit y of
t he cases ,
m e013 [ s] : and y ou ’ve got uh t he probabilit y of t he finer uh
cat egories on t he ot her side .
m e013 [ s] : You m ult iply t hem where appropriat e
m e013 [ fh] : and
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ vocalsound] um
m n007 [ s^ bk] : I see , yeah . Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : if t hey really are from independent [ pause] inform at ion
sources t hen [ v ocalsound] t hey should hav e different kinds of errors
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s] : and roughly independent errors ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and [ vocalsound] it ’s a good choice for [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Yeah , t hat ’s a good idea .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : Because , yeah , well , spect ral subt ract ion is good
m n007 [ s] : and we could u we could use t he fine st ruct ure t o
[ disfm arker] t o have a bet t er est im at e of t he noise
m n007 [ s.%−−] : but [ vocalsound] st ill t here is t his issue wit h spect ral
subt ract ion t hat it seem s t o increase t he variance of [ disfm arker] of
[ disfm arker] of
m e013 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : um
m n007 [ s^ ba] : Well it ’s t his m usical noise which is annoying if you d
y ou do som e kind of on − line norm alizat ion aft er .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m n007 [ fh] : So .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fg|s^ ba] : Well . Spect ral subt ract ion and on − line
norm alizat ion don’t seem t o [ disfm arker] t o go t oget her very well .
m n007 [ %−] : I
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : Or if you do a spect ral subt ract ion [ disfm arker] do
som e spect ral subt ract ion first
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and t hen do som e on − line norm alizat ion
m e013 [ s^ fe^ rt ] : t hen do som e m ore spect ral subt ract ion
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ cs] : I m ean , m aybe [ disfm arker] m aybe you can do it layers
or som et hing

m e013 [ s] : so it doesn’t [ disfm arker] doesn’t hurt t oo m uch or
som et hing .
m n007 [ b] : Ah , yeah .
m e013 [ s^ t c] : But it [ disfm arker] but uh , anyway I t hink I was sort of
arguing against m y self t here by giving t hat exam ple
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s^ df^ rt ] : uh I m ean cuz I was already sort of [ vocalsound]
suggest ing t hat we should be careful about not spending t oo m uch
t im e on ex act ly what t hey ’re doing
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : In fact if you get [ disfm arker] if you go int o uh
[ disfm arker] a uh harm onics − relat ed t hing [ vocalsound] it ’s definit ely
going t o be different t han what t hey ’re doing
m e013 [ fh] : and uh uh
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : should have som e int erest ing propert ies in noise .
m e013 [ fh|s] : Um . [ v ocalsound] I know t hat when have people have

y our feat ure v ect or and adding [ pause] in som e variables which are

m n007 [ s^ bk] : y eah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b.%] : Oh .
m e013 [ s] : But I t hink uh [ pause] t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a

m n007 [ qy ^ rt ] : Was it nois noisy condit ion ?
m n007 [ s.%−−] : t he exam ple t hat you [ disfm arker] you just
m e013 [ s^ nd] : And [ disfm arker] and it m ay not have been noisy

m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t rem em ber t he exam ple
m e013 [ s] : but it was [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] it was on som e DARPA

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : But we were t hinking , we discussed wit h Barry about

m n007 [ s] : and [ v ocalsound] perhaps [ vocalsound] t hinking
[ disfm arker] we were t hinking about som e kind of sheet cheat ing

m e013 [ b^ rt ] : Uh − huh .
m n007 [ s] : and see if giving t he d uh , t his voicing bit would help in

m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : Why don’t you [ disfm arker] why don’t you just do it
wit h Aurora ?
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , but [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] B but we

m e006 [ %−] : We ’re [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s^ ng] : We need labels .

m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : Why not ?
m n007 [ s] : Well , for It alian perhaps we have ,
m n007 [ s] : but we don’t have t his labeling for Aurora .

m n007 [ s] : but not for phonem es .
m e013 [ s^ bk.%] : I see .

m e013 [ fg] : Um .
m n007 [ fh] : Um . [ v ocalsound] Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : But y ou could [ disfm arker] I m ean you can [ disfm arker]
y ou can align so t hat [ disfm arker] It ’s not perfect ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : but if you [ disfm arker] if you know what was said
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : But t he problem is t hat t heir m odels are all word level
m odels .

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e018 [ s] : You [ disfm arker] So you could find out where t he word

m e018 [ s^ rt ] : but t hat ’s about it .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : I see .
m e006 [ s^ cs] : S But we could use uh t he [ disfm arker] t he noisy

m e006 [ s] : which [ v ocalsound] y ou know , is sim ilar t o t he [ disfm arker]
t he noises found in t he TI − digit s [ vocalsound] um port ion of Aurora .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .

m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , t hat ’s right , yep .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ s^ ba^ rt ] : Well , I guess [ disfm arker] I guess we can
[ disfm arker] we can say t hat it will help ,
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ bd^ no] : but I don’t know .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : If t his voicing bit doesn’t help , uh , I t hink we don’t

m n007 [ %−−] : because [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Uh . It ’s just t o know if it [ disfm arker] how m uch i it will

m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : and t o have an idea of how m uch we can gain .
m e013 [ fg] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean in experim ent s t hat we did a long t im e ago
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and different t a
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : it was probably Resource Managem ent or som et hing ,
m e013 [ s] : um , I t hink you were get t ing [ pause] som et hing like st ill
eight or nine percent error on t he voicing , as I recall .
m e013 [ fh] : And um , so um
m e006 [ s^ t 1.%] : Anot her person ’s voice .
m e013 [ s] : what t hat said is t hat , sort of , left t o it s own devices , like
wit hout t he [ disfm arker] a st rong language m odel and so fort h , t hat
y ou would [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] you would m ake significant

m e018 [ %−] : It also [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−−] : one oh
m e018 [ fg|s] : Yeah , t he [ disfm arker] t hough I t hink uh t here was one

m e018 [ s^ df^ rt ] : so [ vocalsound] our t rut h m ay not have really been

m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e006 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ fh] : So .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Well back t went y years ago when I did t his voiced −

m e013 [ s^ bd^ df] : But t hat was [ v ocalsound] speaker − dependent
[ v ocalsound] act ually .
m e013 [ s] : We were doing t raining [ vocalsound] on a part icular

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And we did t his com plex feat ure select ion t hing where we

m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] and [ disfm arker] and uh
[ disfm arker] and exhaust ively searched [ v ocalsound] all size subset s
m e018 [ s^ fe] : Wow !
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and uh [ disfm arker] for [ disfm arker] for

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : But t hat , again , was speaker − dependent wit h
[ v ocalsound] lot s of feat ure select ion
m e013 [ s] : and a v ery com plex sort of t hing .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So I would [ disfm arker] I would believe [ vocalsound]
t hat uh it was quit e likely t hat
m e013 [ fh] : um
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : looking at envelope only , t hat we ’d be [ vocalsound]
significant ly worse t han t hat .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m n007 [ qw^ d^ rt ] : And t he [ disfm arker] all t he [ disfm arker] t he
SpeechCorders ?
m n007 [ qw^ rt .%−−] : what ’s t he idea behind ?
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Cuz t hey [ disfm arker] t hey have t o [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Oh , t hey don’t even have t o det ect voiced spe speech
?
m e013 [ s^ m ^ na] : The m odern ones don’t do a [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] a sim ple swit ch .
m n007 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : They just work on t he code book
m n007 [ s] : and find out t he best excit at ion .
m e013 [ s^ m ^ na] : They work on t he code book ex cit at ion .
m e013 [ s] : Yeah t hey do [ vocalsound] analysis − by − synt hesis .
m e013 [ s] : They t ry [ disfm arker] t hey [ disfm arker] t hey t ry every
[ disfm arker] every possible ex cit at ion t hey have in t heir code book and
find t he one t hat m at ches best .

m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ b] : Alright .
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So it would not help .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e006 [ b] : Hm m .
m e013 [ h] : Uh .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : O K .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Can I just m ent ion one ot her int erest ing t hing ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fg|s.%−−] : Um . One of t he ideas t hat we [ pause] had com e up
wit h last week for t hings t o t ry t o [ vocalsound] im prove t he syst em
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fh] : Um .
m e018 [ s] : Act ually I [ disfm arker] I s we didn’t [ disfm arker] I guess I
wrot e t his in aft er t he m eet ing
m e018 [ s] : b but [ v ocalsound] t he t hought I had was um looking at
t he language m odel t hat ’s used in t he HTK recognizer ,
m e018 [ s] : which is basically just a big [ v ocalsound] loop ,
m e006 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
m e018 [ s] : So you [ disfm arker] it goes " digit "
fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : and t hen t hat can be [ disfm arker] eit her go t o silence or
go t o anot her digit ,
m e018 [ %−−] : which [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : That m odel would allow for t he product ion of [ vocalsound]
infinit ely long sequences of digit s ,
m e018 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e018 [ s:s] : So . I t hought " well I ’m gonna just look at t he
[ disfm arker] what act ual digit st rings do occur in t he t raining dat a . "
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s] : And t he int erest ing t hing was it t urns out t hat t here are
no sequences of t wo − long or t hree − long digit st rings [ pause] in any
of t he Aurora t raining dat a .
m e018 [ s] : So it ’s eit her one , four , five , six ,
m e018 [ fh|s^ rt ] : uh up t o eleven ,
m e018 [ s] : and t hen it skips
m e018 [ s] : and t hen t here ’s som e at sixt een .
m e013 [ qw] : But what about t he t est ing dat a ?
m e018 [ h|s^ no] : Um . I don’t know .
m e018 [ s^ df] : I didn’t look at t he t est dat a yet .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fh] : So .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean if t here ’s som e t est ing dat a t hat has
[ disfm arker] has [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] has t wo or t hree
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : But I just t hought t hat was a lit t le odd ,
m e018 [ s.%−−] : t hat t here were no t wo or t hree long [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ fa.%] : Sorry .
m e018 [ s] : So I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] just for t he heck of it , I
m ade a lit t le gram m ar which um , you know , had it ’s separat e pat h
[ pause] for each lengt h digit st ring y ou could get .
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : So t here was a one − long pat h
m e018 [ s] : and t here was a four − long and a five − long
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : and I t ried t hat and it got way worse .
m e018 [ s] : There were lot s of delet ions .
m e018 [ s^ rt ] : So it was [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] you know , I
[ disfm arker] I didn’t have any weight s of t hese pat hs
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : or [ disfm arker] I didn’t have anyt hing like t hat .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : And I played wit h t weaking t he [ vocalsound] word
t ransit ion penalt ies a bunch ,
m e018 [ s] : but I couldn’t go anywhere .
m e018 [ fh] : But um .
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ s.%−−:s.%−−] : I t hought " well if I only allow [ disfm arker] "
m e018 [ s] : Yeah , I guess I should have looked at [ disfm arker] t o see
how oft en t here was a m ist ake where a t wo − long or a t hree − long
pat h was act ually put out as a hypot hesis .
m e018 [ fh] : Um . But .
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ s] : So t o do t hat right y ou ’d probably want t o have
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] allow for t hem all
m e018 [ s] : but t hen have weight ings and t hings .
m e018 [ s] : So . I just t hought t hat was a int erest ing [ vocalsound]
t hing about t he dat a .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : OK .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : So we ’re gonna read som e m ore digit st rings I
guess ?
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : You want t o go ahead , Morgan ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
