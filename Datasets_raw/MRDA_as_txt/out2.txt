m e012 [ %−] : Well [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ aa] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ fa^ t 3.%−] : I ’m sorry I [ disfm arker]

m e003 [ s^ co] : Int roduce .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e012 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , um [ vocalsound] Well , " t he search for t he
m iddle layer " .

m e012 [ s] : It ’s basically uh t alks about uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] It
just refers t o t he fact t hat uh [ pause] one of m ain t hings we had t o do
was t o [ pause] decide what t he int erm ediat e sort of nodes were ,
fe004 [ s^ fe^ j] : I can read !
fe004 [ s^ bd] : I ’m kidding .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s.%−] : you know , because [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : But if you really want t o find out what it ’s about you have
t o [ pause] click on t he lit t le [ pause] light bulb .
m e003 [ s^ no] : Alt hough I ’ve [ disfm arker] I ’ve never [ disfm arker] I
don’t know what t he light bulb is for .
m e003 [ s] : I didn’t i inst all t hat int o m y [ pause] PowerPoint
present at ion .
m n015 [ s] : It opens t he Assist ant t hat t ells you t hat t he font t ype is
t oo sm all .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : Ah .
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ] : Do y ou wanna t ry ?
fe004 [ %−] : Ach u
m e003 [ s^ nd] : I ’d prefer not t o .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ co] : Cont inue .
fe004 [ s] : It ’s a needless good idea .
fe004 [ qy ^ g] : Is t hat t he idea ?
m n015 [ qw] : Why are you doing t his in t his m ode and not in t he
present at ion m ode ?
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e003 [ s^ rt ] : Because I ’m gonna swit ch t o t he JavaBayes program
m n015 [ s^ bk] : Oh ! OK .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : Of course .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s] : and t hen [ pause] if I do t hat it ’ll m ess everyt hing up .
fe004 [ s] : I was wondering .
m e003 [ qy^ rt ] : Is t hat OK ?
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , it ’s OK .
m n015 [ b] : Sure .
m e012 [ qy ^ rt ] : Can you m axim ize t he window ?
fe004 [ s^ co] : Proceed .
m e003 [ qy^ d.%−−] : You want m e t o [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ qw^ br] : Wait , what do you want m e t o do ?
m e012 [ qy ] : Can y ou m axim ize t he window so all t hat st uff on t he side
isn’t [ disfm arker] doesn’t appear ?
m n015 [ s^ ar] : No , It ’s OK .
m n015 [ s] : It ’s [ disfm arker] It ’ll work .
m e003 [ s^ aap] : Well I can do t hat ,
m e003 [ s^ ng] : but t hen I have t o end t he present at ion in t he m iddle
so I can go back t o open up

m e012 [ s^ bk] : OK , fine .
m e003 [ s.%−] : Here , let ’s see if I can [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ bk] : Alright .
fe004 [ s^ ba] : Very nice .
m e003 [ qy^ rt ] : Is t hat bet t er ?
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e003 [ s^ cc] : Uh [ disfm arker] I ’ll also get rid of t his " Click t o add
not es " .
m e003 [ b] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ ba] : Perfect .
m e003 [ s] : So t hen t he feat ures we decided [ disfm arker] or we
decided we were [ disfm arker] t alked about ,
m e003 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
m e003 [ s] : Uh t he [ disfm arker] t he prosody , t he discourse , [ pause]
v erb choice .
m e003 [ s] : You know . We had a list of t hings like " t o go " and " t o
v isit " and what not .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : The " landm ark − iness " of uh [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : I knew you ’d like t hat .
fe004 [ s^ ba] : Nice coinage .
m e003 [ s^ ft ] : Thank you .
m e003 [ s] : uh , of a [ disfm arker] of a building .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : Whet her t he
m e003 [ s] : and t his i we act ually have a separat e feat ure
m e003 [ s] : but I decided t o put it on t he sam e line [ pause] for space .
m e003 [ s] : " Nice walls " [ vocalsound] which we can look up
m e003 [ s.%−−] : because I m ean if you ’re gonna [ pause] get real close
t o a building in t he Tango m ode ,
m e003 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right ,
m e003 [ s] : t here ’s got t a be a reason for it .
m e003 [ s] : And it ’s eit her because you ’re in rout e t o som et hing else
or y ou wanna look at t he walls .
m e003 [ s] : The cont ext , which in t his case we ’ve lim it ed t o [ pause] "
business person " , " t ourist " , or [ pause] " unknown " ,
m e003 [ s] : t he t im e of day ,
m e003 [ s] : and " open t o suggest ions " , isn’t act ually a feat ure .
m e003 [ s] : It ’s [ pause] " We are open t o suggest ions . "
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe004 [ qy.%−−] : can I just ask t he nice walls part of it is t hat
[ v ocalsound] uh , in t his part icular dom ain [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ df] : y ou said [ disfm arker] be [ disfm arker] i it could be on t wo
different lines
fe004 [ qy .%−] : but are you saying t hat in t his part icular dom ain it
happens t he [ disfm arker] t hat landm ark − iness cor is correlat ed wit h
m e012 [ s^ ar] : No .

m e003 [ %−] : Oh [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ nd.%−] : We have a separat e
m e003 [ s] : They ’re separat e t hings .
fe004 [ s.%−] : t heir being nice w
m e012 [ s^ bsc] : feat ure .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e003 [ b] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s] : I eit her could put " nice walls " on it s own line or " open t o
suggest ions " off t he slide .
fe004 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s.%−] : Like you could hav e a p
fe004 [ qy ^ d.%−] : By " nice " you m ean [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s] : You [ disfm arker] Like you could have a post office wit h uh
[ disfm arker] you know , nice m urals or som et hing .
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e003 [ s.%−] : Or one t im e I was at t his [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bu] : So " nice walls " is a st and in for like archit ect urally it ,
uh [ disfm arker] significant
m e012 [ s^ na] : Archit ect urally appealing from t he out side .
fe004 [ s] : or som et hing like t hat .
m e003 [ s^ nd.%−] : But see t he t hing is , if it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e003 [ fg|s^ ng.%−−] : Yeah but if it ’s archit ect urally significant you
m ight be able t o see it from [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : Like you m m ight be able t o " Vist a " it ,
m e003 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : And be able t o [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ 2] : Appreciat e it .
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e003 [ s.%−−] : v ersus , like ,
m e003 [ s^ rt ] : I was at t his place in Europe where t hey had lit t le
carv ings of , like , dead people on t he walls or som et hing .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s^ no.%−−] : I don’t rem em ber w
fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e003 [ s] : It was a long t im e ago .
fe004 [ s] : There ’s a lot of t hose .
m e003 [ s] : But if you looked at it real close , you could see t he
[ disfm arker] t he in int ricacy of t he [ disfm arker] of t he walls .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ bu] : So t hat count as [ disfm arker] count s as a nice wall .
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe004 [ %−] : The [ disfm arker]

fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ bu] : Som et hing you want t o inspect at close range [ pause]
because it ’s int erest ing .
m n015 [ %−] : The [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Ex act ly .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
m e003 [ qy ^ d] : Robert ?
m n015 [ s] : Well t here [ disfm arker] t here is a t erm [ pause] t hat ’s
oft en used .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : That ’s " saliency " , or t he " salience " of an object .
m n015 [ s] : And I was just wondering whet her t hat ’s t he sam e as what
y ou describe as " landm ark − iness " .
m n015 [ s] : But it ’s really not .
m n015 [ s] : I m ean an object can be very salient
fe004 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ s^ 2] : but not a landm ark at all .
fe004 [ s^ m ] : Not a landm ark at all .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : There ’s landm ark for um , t ourist ic reasons and
landm ark for
fe004 [ s^ no] : I don’t know
fe004 [ s] : nav igat ional reasons or som et hing .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ b] : Yep .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah ,
m e012 [ s] : we m eant , uh , t ourist ic reasons .
m e003 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ b] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ bu] : but you can im agine m ay be want ing t he ot h bot h kinds
of t hings t here for different um , goals .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e003 [ s^ arp.%−−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ b] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : Tourist − y landm arks also happen t o be [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ qy .%−−] : Wouldn’t [ disfm arker] couldn’t t hey also be
[ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ bu] : They ’re not ex clusive groups ,
m e003 [ qy ^ g] : are t hey ?

m e003 [ s.%−−] : Like [ pause] non − t ourist − y landm arks and
m n015 [ s.%−] : Or it can be als
fe004 [ qy ^ m ^ rt ] : They ’re not m ut ually exclusive ?
m e003 [ s.%−] : direct navigat ional [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Definit ely .
m e003 [ fg|s] : OK , So our init ial idea was not very sat isfying , [ pause]
because [ disfm arker] uh our init ial idea was basically all t he feat ures
point ing t o t he out put node .
m e003 [ fh] : Uh .
fe004 [ s^ bu] : So , a big flat st ruct ure .
fe004 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : And uh , so we [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : Reasons being , you know , it ’d be a pain t o set up all t he
probabilit ies for t hat .
m e003 [ s] : If we m ov ed ont o t he next st ep and did learning of som e
sort , uh according Bhaskara we ’d be handicapped .
m e003 [ s^ no] : I don’t know belief − net s very well .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : Well usually , I m ean , you know , N [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s] : If you have N feat ures , t hen it ’s t wo t o t he N [ disfm arker]
[ pause] or exponent ial in N .
m e003 [ s^ 2] : And t hey wouldn’t look pret t y .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : So .
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e012 [ s] : t hey ’d all be like point ing t o t he one node .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ fh] : Uh .
m e003 [ s] : So t hen our next idea was t o add a m iddle layer ,
m e003 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
m e003 [ s.%−−] : So t he t hinking behind t hat was [ vocalsound] we have
t he feat ures t hat we ’ve drawn [ pause] from t he com m unicat ion of
som e [ disfm arker] Like , t he som eone s
m e003 [ s] : The person at t he screen is t rying t o com m unicat e som e
abst ract idea ,
m e003 [ s] : like " I ’m [ disfm arker] " t he [ disfm arker] t he abst ract idea
being " I am a t ourist
m e003 [ s] : I want t o go [ pause] t o t his place . "
m e003 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e003 [ s] : So we ’re gonna set up feat ures along t he lines of where
t hey want t o go
m e003 [ s] : and [ pause] what t hey ’ve said previously and what not .

m e003 [ s] : And t hen we have [ pause] t he m eans [ vocalsound] t hat
t hey should use .
m e003 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e003 [ s] : but t he m iddle t hing , we were t hinking along t he lines of
m ay be t ry ing t o figure out , like , t he concept of whet her t hey ’re a
t ourist [ pause] or [ pause] whet her t hey ’re running an errand or
som et hing like t hat
m e003 [ s] : along t hose lines .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : Or [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ aa|s] : Yes , we could t hings we couldn’t ext ract t he
[ disfm arker] from t he dat a , t he hidden variables .
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Yes ,
m e003 [ s^ ba] : good .
m e003 [ s] : So t hen t he hidden variables [ disfm arker] hair variables we
cam e up wit h were whet her som eone was on a t our , running an
errand , or whet her t hey were in a hurry ,
m e003 [ s.%−] : because we were t hinking uh , if t hey were in a hurry
t here ’d be less likely t o [ disfm arker] like [ disfm arker] or t h
m e012 [ s^ 2] : Want t o do Vist a ,
m e012 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e012 [ s^ df] : Because [ pause] if y ou want t o view t hings you
wouldn’t be in a hurry .
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e003 [ s] : Or t hey m ight be m ore likely t o be using t he place t hat
t hey want t o go t o as a [ disfm arker] like a [ pause] navigat ional point
t o go t o anot her place .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s] : Whet her t he dest inat ion was t heir final dest inat ion ,
m e003 [ s] : whet her t he dest inat ion was closed .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : Those are all [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ t c] : And t hen " Let ’s look at t he belief − net " [ com m ent ] OK
.
m e003 [ s^ t 1] : So t hat m eans t hat I should swit ch t o t he [ pause]
ot her program .
m e003 [ s] : Um right now it ’s st ill kind of [ pause] in a t oy [ pause]
v ersion of it ,
m e003 [ s.%−−] : because we didn’t know t he probabilit ies of
[ disfm arker] [ pause] or [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : Well I ’ll t alk about it when I get t he pict ure up .
m n015 [ s] : No one knows it .
m e003 [ h] : OK .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : So t his right [ disfm arker] what we [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ t 1] : Let ’s see .
m e003 [ qw^ t 1] : What happens if I m axim ize t his ?
m e003 [ s^ t 1] : There we go .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : But uh [ disfm arker]

m e003 [ s] : So . The m ode [ pause] basically has t hree different
[ pause] out put s .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : The probabilit y [ disfm arker] whet her t he probabilit y of
a Vist a , Tango , or Ent er .
m e003 [ h|s] : Um [ disfm arker] The " cont ext " , we sim plified .
m e003 [ s] : Basically it ’s just t he businessm an , t he t ourist , unknown
.
m e003 [ s] : " Verb used " is act ually personally am using
m e003 [ s] : m ainly because it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s just whet her t he verb
is a Tango v erb , an Ent er verb , or a [ pause] Vist a verb .
m e012 [ fg] : Yeah ,
m e012 [ s.%−] : t hat one needs a lot of [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qy ] : And are t hose m ut ually ex clusive set s ?
m e012 [ s^ ar] : Not at all .
m e012 [ s^ r] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat needs a lot of
work .
m e003 [ s^ ar] : No .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Got it .
m e012 [ s] : But uh [ vocalsound] [ pause] t hat would ’ve m ade t he
probably significant ly be m ore com plicat ed t o ent er ,
fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s^ rt ] : so we decided t hat for t he purposes of t his [ pause] it
’d be sim pler t o just have t hree verbs .
fe004 [ s] : Sim ple .
m e003 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : St ab at it .
fe004 [ b] : Yep .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m e003 [ fg] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ qh^ cs] : Why don’t you m ent ion t hings about t his , Bhaskara ,
m e003 [ s] : t hat I am [ disfm arker] not [ disfm arker] t hat are not com ing
t o m y m ind right now .
m e012 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , so [ disfm arker] Yeah , so not e t he four nodes
down t here , t he [ disfm arker] sort of , t he t hings t hat are not direct ly
ex t ract ed .
m e012 [ s^ bsc] : Act ually , t he five t hings .
m e012 [ s] : The " closed " is also not direct ly ext ract ed I guess ,
m e012 [ s.%−] : from t he uh [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ %−] : Well i it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qy ^ 2^ bu^ d^ rt ] : From t he [ pause] ut t erance ?
m e012 [ b] : Hm m .
m e012 [ s^ ar] : Act ually , no ,
m e003 [ s^ nd] : it ’s so it sort of is
m e012 [ s^ co] : wait .

m e012 [ s^ aa^ bsc] : It is .
m e003 [ s^ df] : because it ’s [ disfm arker] because have t he
[ disfm arker] t he t im e of day
m e012 [ s] : OK , " closed " sort of is .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : and t he close
m e003 [ s] : it just had t he [ disfm arker] er and what t im e it closed .
m e012 [ s^ bk] : Right ,
m e012 [ %−] : so f
m e012 [ fg] : Right ,
m e012 [ s] : but t he ot her ones , t he final dest inat ion , t he whet her
t hey ’re doing business , whet her t hey ’re in a hurry , and whet her t hey
’re t ourist s ,
m e012 [ s] : t hat kind of t hing is all uh [ v ocalsound] sort of [ disfm arker]
y ou know probabilist ically depends on t he ot her t hings .
fe004 [ qy ^ 2^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Inferred from t he ot her ones ?
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : OK .
m e012 [ s] : And t he m ode , you know , depends on all t hose t hings
only .
m e003 [ s] : Yeah t he [ disfm arker] [ pause] t he act ual parse is
som ewhere up around in here .
m e012 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : So we haven’t uh , m anaged [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s] : Like we don’t have nodes for " discourse " and " parse " ,
m e012 [ s] : alt hough like in som e sense t hey are part s of t his belief −
net .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s] : But uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] The idea is t hat we just
ex t ract t hose feat ures from t hem , so we don’t act ually have a node
for t he ent ire parse ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m e012 [ s] : because we ’d nev er do inference on it anyway ,
m e012 [ fh] : so .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : So som e of t he [ disfm arker] t he t op row of t hings
[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qw] : What ’s [ disfm arker] what ’s " Disc adm ission fee " ?
m e012 [ s] : whet her t hey discuss t he adm ission fees .
m e012 [ s] : So we looked at t he dat a
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e012 [ s:qw] : and in a lot of dat a people were saying t hings like
[ v ocalsound] " Can I get t o t his place ? "
m e012 [ s:qw] : " What is t he adm ission fee ? " .
m e012 [ s] : So t hat ’s like a huge uh clue t hat t hey ’re t rying t o Ent er
t he place rat her t han uh t o Tango or Vist a ,
fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .

m e003 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ b] : OK .
m e012 [ fg] : so .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e003 [ s] : There were [ disfm arker] t here ’d be ot her t hings besides
just t he adm ission fee ,
m e003 [ s.%−] : but [ pause] you know , [ pause] we didn’t have
[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s] : That was like our exam ple .
m e003 [ s] : That was t he [ pause] init ial one t hat we found .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ bu] : So t here are cert ain cues t hat are very st rong [ pause]
eit her lexical or t opic − based um , concept cues
m e003 [ s^ 2.%−] : From t he discourse t hat [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : for one of t hose .
fe004 [ s^ bu] : And t hen in t hat second row [ pause] or what ever t hat
row of Tim e of Day t hrough t hat [ disfm arker] So all of t hose
[ disfm arker] Som e of t hem com e from t he ut t erance
fe004 [ s^ bu] : and som e of t hem are sort of [ vocalsound] eit her world
knowledge or sit uat ional [ pause] t hings .
fe004 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
fe004 [ s^ bu.%−] : So t hat you have no dist inct ion bet ween t hose and
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e003 [ fg] : One , uh [ disfm arker] Uh . [ vocalsound] Um ,
m e003 [ qo^ rt ^ t c] : anyt hing else you want t o say Bhaskara ?
m e012 [ h] : Um .
fe004 [ qy .%] : " Unm ark @ @ Tim e of Day "
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e012 [ s.%−] : I m I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s.%−] : One t hing [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : They ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re are a couple of m ore t hings .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : I m ean Uh . I would act ually suggest we go t hrough t his
one m ore t im e so we [ disfm arker] we all uh , agree on what
[ disfm arker] what t he m eaning of t hese t hings is at t he m om ent
m n015 [ s.%−] : and m aybe [ vocalsound] what changes we [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ aa.%−] : Yeah , t h
m e003 [ fg] : OK .
m e003 [ s] : so one t hing I [ disfm arker] I ’m you know unsure about , is
how we hav e t he discus uh [ disfm arker] t he " adm ission fee " t hing set
up .

m e003 [ s.%−−] : So one [ pause] t hing t hat we were t hinking was
[ v ocalsound] by doing t he layers like t his ,
m e003 [ s] : Uh [ disfm arker] we kept um [ disfm arker] t hings from
direct ly affect ing t he m ode [ pause] beyond t he concept ,
m e003 [ s] : but y ou could see perhaps discus t he " adm ission fee "
going direct ly t o t he m ode point ing at " Ent er " ,
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
m e003 [ s^ rt ] : Versus point ing t o just at " t ourist " ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : OK ?
m e003 [ s] : But we just decided t o keep all t he t hings we ext ract ed
[ pause] t o point at t he m iddle and t hen [ pause] down .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ qw^ rt .%−−] : Why is t he landm ark [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : The landm ark is facing t o t he t ourist s .
m n015 [ s^ bu] : That ’s because we ’re t alking about landm arks as
t ourist ic landm arks
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n015 [ s.%−] : not as possible um
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Navigat ional landm arks ,
fe004 [ s^ 2] : Nav igat ional cue .
m e003 [ b] : y eah .
m n015 [ s^ 2] : navigat ional landm arks
m n015 [ fh] : so
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ b] : Yeah ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : Then [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : t hat would be [ pause] what ever building t hey referred t o .
fe004 [ s.%] : Prosody .
m e012 [ b] : Right .
m e012 [ s^ t 1] : So let ’s see .
m e012 [ s] : The variables .
m e012 [ s] : Disc − " adm ission fee " is a binary t hing ,
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : " t im e of day " is like m orning , aft ernoon , night .
m e012 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Is t hat t he deal ?
m e003 [ s^ na] : That ’s how we have it current ly set up ,
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s] : but it could be , [ pause] you know , based upon hour
m n015 [ s^ aa.%] : Yep .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .

m e003 [ s] : or [ pause] dis we could discret e it [ disfm arker] des
descret − ize it .
m n015 [ s] : What ev er granularit y .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m e012 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s] : Norm ally cont ext will include a huge am ount of inform at ion
,
m e012 [ s^ rt ] : but um , we are just using t he part icular [ vocalsound]
part of t he cont ext which consist s of t he swit ch t hat t hey flick t o
indicat e whet her t hey ’re a t ourist or not , I guess .
m n015 [ b] : Yep .
fe004 [ fg] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ bs] : So t hat ’s given in t heir input .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m e012 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Right ,
m e012 [ s] : so it ’s not really all of cont ext .
m e012 [ s] : Sim ilarly prosody is not all of prosody
m e012 [ s] : but sim ply [ vocalsound] for our purposes whet her or not
t hey appear t ense or relaxed .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ ba] : t hat ’s very nice ,
m n015 [ qy^ d^ g] : huh ?
fe004 [ b] : OK .
m e012 [ %−] : and
m n015 [ qy^ rt ] : The [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] So t he cont ext is a
swit ch bet ween t ourist or non − t ourist ?
m n015 [ qrr] : Or also unknown ?
m e003 [ s^ aap] : Or un [ pause] unknown ,
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e012 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Unknown ,
fe004 [ s.%−−] : So final dest
m e012 [ qy ^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe004 [ s] : So it seem s like t hat would really help you for doing
business v ersus t ourist ,
m e012 [ qw] : Which is t h Which one ?
fe004 [ s.%−−] : but
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : so t he t he cont ex t being um , e
fe004 [ s^ no] : I don’t know if t hat quest ion ’s sort of in general ,

fe004 [ qy .%−−] : " are you [ disfm arker] "
fe004 [ s.%−−] : I m ean t he [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qy .%−−] : ar ar are
fe004 [ qy ^ rt ] : do t hey allow business people t o be doing non −
business t hings at t he m om ent ?
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , it does .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : So t hen you just have som e probabilit ies over
[ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s] : Everyt hing is probablist ic ,
m e012 [ s.%−−] : and [ disfm arker] There ’s always [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK . [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : ov er which which of t hose it is .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m e012 [ h|s^ bk] : Um , right .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : So t hen landm ark is [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ fe] : Oh ,
m e012 [ s^ fa] : sorry .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : " Verb used " is like ,
m e012 [ s] : right now we only have t hree v alues ,
m e012 [ s] : but in general t hey would be a probabilit y dist ribut ion over
all v erbs .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : Rat her ,
m e012 [ s] : let m e rephrase t hat .
m e012 [ s^ bsc^ rt ] : It [ disfm arker] it can t ake values [ vocalsound] in
t he set of all v erbs , t hat t hey could possibly use .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s] : Um " nice walls " is binary ,
m e012 [ s] : " closed " is binary
m e012 [ s.%−−] : " final dest inat ion " , again [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s] : Yeah , all t hose are binary I guess .
m e012 [ s] : And " m ode " is one of t hree t hings .
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ] : So , t he [ disfm arker] t he m iddle layer is also binary ?
m n015 [ s.%−−] : No .
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e012 [ s] : anyt hing wit h a quest ion m ark aft er it in t hat pict ure is a
binary node .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : Uh . It [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s^ bu] : But all t hose t hings wit hout quest ion m arks are also
binary .
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e012 [ qw] : Which t hings ?
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : Nice walls ?

m e003 [ s.%−] : Wi
m e012 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e012 [ s] : " Nice walls " is uh [ disfm arker] som et hing t hat we ext ract
from our world knowledge .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , a Oh
m e012 [ s^ aa] : y eah . Sorry . It is binary .
m e003 [ s^ m ] : It is binary
m e012 [ s^ aa] : That ’s t rue .
m e003 [ s^ df] : but it doesn’t have quest ion m ark because it ’s
ex t ract ed .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s] : OK , I see your point .
m e003 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ b] : OK .
fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : I [ disfm arker] I got cha .
m e012 [ s] : Yeah , sim ilarly " closed " , I guess .
m n015 [ s] : So we can eit her be in a hurry or not ,
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ] : but we cannot be in a m edium hurry at t he m om ent ?
m e012 [ s.%−−] : Well , we
m e012 [ s] : To do t hat we would add anot her uh [ disfm arker] value for
t hat .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e012 [ s] : And t hat would require s updat ing t he probabilit y
dist ribut ion for " m ode " as well .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s^ df] : Because it would now hav e t o like uh [ disfm arker] t ake
t hat possibilit y int o account .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : Take a cont i
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ fg|s^ rt ] : So um , of course t his will happen when we t hink m ore
about t he kinds of verbs t hat are used in each cases
m n015 [ b] : Yeah , yeah .
fe004 [ s] : but y ou can im agine t hat it ’s verb plus various ot her t hings
t hat are also not in t he bot t om layer t hat would [ disfm arker] t hat
would help y ou [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : Like it ’s a conjunct ion of ,
fe004 [ s^ no] : I don’t know ,
fe004 [ s.%−−] : y ou know , t he verb used and som e ot her st uff t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat would [ vocalsound] [ pause] det erm ine [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ fg] : Right .

m e012 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : Ot her synt act ic inform at ion you m ean ?
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Ex act ly .
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ h] : Um .
m n015 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : well t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] sort of t he
landm ark is [ disfm arker] is sort of t he object
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m n015 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : t he argum ent in a sense ?
fe004 [ s^ aap] : Usually .
fe004 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know if t hat ’s always t he case
fe004 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I guess hav en’t looked at t he dat a as m uch
as y ou guys hav e .
fe004 [ fh] : So . Um .
m n015 [ s] : t hat ’s always warping on som et hing [ disfm arker] som e

fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : and um [ disfm arker] Uh m aybe at t his st age we will
[ disfm arker] we do want t o [ disfm arker] uh sort of get [ disfm arker] uh
m odifiers in t here
m e003 [ b] : Hm m . Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : because t hey m ay also t ell us whet her t he person is in a

m e012 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s:s] : I want t o get t o t he church quickly ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s.%−] : and uh [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e012 [ s^ aa] : right .
fe004 [ s] : That would be a cue .
m n015 [ s.%−−:qw] : what ’s t he fast est way
m e012 [ b] : Yeah ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ b] : correct .
fe004 [ b] : Um . OK .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m e003 [ b] : Ex cellent .
m e003 [ qy ] : Do we have anyt hing else t o say about t his ?
m e012 [ s^ na] : We can do a lit t le dem o .
m e003 [ s^ bk.%−−] : Oh t he
m e003 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : Yeah , we could .
m e003 [ s^ arp] : But t he dem o doesn’t work very well .
m n015 [ s^ ar] : No ,
m n015 [ s] : t hen it wouldn’t be a dem o

m e012 [ s^ df] : I m ean [ disfm arker] We can do a dem o in t he sense
t hat we can um , [ vocalsound] just ob observe t he fact t hat t his will , in

m n015 [ s.%−−] : I was just gonna s
m e003 [ s^ 2] : Observe nodes .
m e012 [ s] : So we can , you know , set som e of t he uh nodes
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ co] : Go ahead .
m e012 [ s] : and t hen t ry t o find t he probabilit y of ot her nodes .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e003 [ s^ t 1] : Dat − dat − dah .
m e003 [ qw] : What should I observe ?
m e012 [ s^ co] : Just se set a few of t hem .
m e012 [ s^ co] : You don’t have t o do t he whole t hing t hat we did last
t im e .
m e012 [ s] : Just like uh , [ vocalsound] m aybe t he fact t hat t hey use a

m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e012 [ s^ co] : Act ually forget t he verb .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : just uh [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ no] : I don’t know ,
m e012 [ s] : say t hey discussed t he adm ission fee [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ b] : OK .
m e012 [ s] : and uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t he place has nice walls
m e003 [ s^ bk^ j] : I love nice walls ,
m e003 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : OK ?
m e003 [ s^ j] : I ’m a big fan .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : it ’s st art ing t o grow on m e
m e012 [ s] : and it ’s night .
m e003 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ m ] : And t he t im e of day is night ?
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e012 [ s^ ar^ bsc] : no
m e012 [ h] : wait .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : That [ disfm arker] t hat doesn’t uh [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ df] : it ’s not really consist ent .
m e012 [ s] : They don’t discuss t he adm ission fee .
m e012 [ s^ co] : Make t hat false .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : Alright .
m e012 [ s] : And it ’s night .
m e003 [ %−−] : Oh , t hey [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e003 [ s^ t 1] : Oh whoops .
m e012 [ s] : That didn’t work .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : I forgot t o uh [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ fe] : Ach !

fe004 [ s] : I ’d like t o do t hat again .
m e003 [ s] : One t hing t hat bugs m e about JavaBayes is you have t o
click t hat and do t his .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s^ na] : That seem s kind of redundant
fe004 [ s.%−−] : but .
m e012 [ s^ t c] : OK .
m e003 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : That all you want ?
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e003 [ s^ t 1] : So let ’s see .
m e003 [ s^ bu] : I want [ pause] t o query ,
m e012 [ s^ co] : " Go " and , right , " query " .
m e003 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e003 [ s] : t he m ode .
m e003 [ s^ rt ^ t 1.%−−] : OK , and t hen on here [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ t 1] : So let ’s see .
m e012 [ s] : So t hat [ pause] is t he probabilit y t hat t hey ’re Ent ering ,
Vist a − ing or Tango − ing .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ b] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s.%−] : And uh [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So slight ly [ pause] biased [ pause] t oward "
Tango " ing
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : OK .
m e003 [ s] : If it ’s night t im e , [ pause] t hey have not discussed

m e003 [ s] : So , y eah .
m e003 [ s^ am ] : I guess t hat [ pause] sort of m akes sense .
m e003 [ s^ df^ rt ] : The reason I say t he [ pause] dem o doesn’t work
v ery well is yest erday we uh [ disfm arker] [ pause] observed everyt hing

m e003 [ s] : and it cam e up as " Tango " ,
m e003 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
m e003 [ s] : Over and over again .
fe004 [ s.%−] : So .
m e003 [ s^ j] : We couldn’t [ disfm arker] we couldn’t figure out how t o
t urn it off of " Tango " .
fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe004 [ s^ fe] : Huh !
m e012 [ s^ j] : It lov es t he Tango .
fe004 [ fg] : Um .
m e012 [ s] : Well , t hat ’s obviously just t o do wit h our probabilit ies .
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
m e012 [ s] : Like , [ pause] we t ot ally hand − t uned t he probabilit ies ,

fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e012 [ b] : right .
m e012 [ s:s^ cs] : We were like [ vocalsound] " hm m , well if t he person

fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : fift y per " Like , y ou know .
m e012 [ s] : So obv iously t hat ’s gonna happen .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m e003 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ fg] : Yeah
m n015 [ s.%−] : but it [ disfm arker] it
fe004 [ s] : Maybe t he bias t oward " Tango " ing was yours , t hen ?
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e012 [ s^ cs] : It ’s [ disfm arker] So we have t o like fit t he probabilit ies
.
m e003 [ s.%−] : t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s at [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ j] : Spent m y yout h pract icing t he t ango de la m uert e .
fe004 [ s] : So , t he real case ?
m n015 [ s] : However you know , it [ disfm arker] The purpose was not

m n015 [ s] : but t o get t hinking about t hat hidden m iddle layer .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : And so t h
m n015 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s.%−−] : We would act ually [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ rt ] : I guess once we look at t he dat a m ore we ’ll get m ore

m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s] : but I ’d like t o see m ore .
m e003 [ s^ rt ] : Not because it would [ pause] expedit e t he probabilit ies
, cuz it wouldn’t .
m e003 [ s] : It would act ually slow t hat down t rem endously .
m e012 [ fg|s] : Um . Well , yeah ,
m e012 [ s^ am ] : I guess .
m e003 [ %−] : But .
m e012 [ s^ arp] : Not t hat m uch t hough .
m e012 [ s^ df] : Only a lit t le early .
m e003 [ s^ ar.%] : No ,

fe004 [ s^ bu] : They refer t o your current t ask .
fe004 [ s^ e] : Like [ disfm arker] like current t hing you want t o do at t his
m om ent .
m e012 [ h|s^ bk] : Um . Yeah ,
m e012 [ h|s^ ba] : well [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] That ’s [ disfm arker]
t hat ’s an int erest ing point .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : Whet her you ’re [ disfm arker] It ’s whet her [ disfm arker]
It ’s not [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qy.%−−] : And are t h
m e012 [ s:qy ] : I t hink it ’s m ore like " Are you are t ourist ?
m e012 [ s.%−] : are you in Ham − like Heidelberg for a [ disfm arker] "
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Oh ,
fe004 [ s] : so , I t hought t hat was direct ly given by t he cont ext [ pause]
swit ch .
m e012 [ s^ nd] : That ’s a different t hing .
m e012 [ qh:s] : What if t he cont ext , which is not set , but st ill t hey say
t hings like , " I want t o go [ pause] uh , see t he uh [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t he cast le and uh , et cet era . "
m n015 [ qy .%−] : Is it [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : Well t he I kind of [ pause] t hought of " doing business " as
m ore of running an errand t ype t hing .
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s] : Business on t he ot her hand is , uh , definit ely what you ’re
doing .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : So if you run out of cash as a t ourist , and [ disfm arker]
and [ disfm arker] and you need t o go t o t he AT
m e003 [ s.%−] : So [ pause] i wi t h
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see ,
fe004 [ s^ bs] : y ou m ay have a t ask .
fe004 [ s^ bs] : wh you have t o go get m oney and so you are doing
business at t hat st age .
m n015 [ b] : Mm m .
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n015 [ s:qw] : " How do I get t o t he bank ? "
fe004 [ s^ bk] : I see .
fe004 [ b] : Hm m .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : And t hat ’ll affect whet her you want t o ent er or you if
y ou [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s] : kinda t hing .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ bu] : So t he " t ourist s " node [ pause] should be [ pause] um ,
v ery consist ent wit h t he cont ex t node .
fe004 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?

fe004 [ s] : If you say t hat ’s m ore t heir [ disfm arker] in general what
t heir background is .
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e012 [ s.%−−] : I t hink t his cont ex t node is a bit of a [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ no] : I don’t know ,
m e012 [ s.%−−] : like in d
m e012 [ qy .%−−] : Uh [ disfm arker] Do we [ pause] wanna have
[ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s.%−] : Like it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qr] : Are y ou assum ing t hat or not ?
fe004 [ s^ df] : Like is t hat t o be [ disfm arker] I m ean if t hat ’s accurat e
t hen t hat would det erm ine t ourist node .
m e012 [ s] : If t he cont ext were t o set one way or anot her , t hat like
st rongly uh um , says som et hing about whet her [ disfm arker] whet her
or not t hey ’re t ourist s .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s^ rt ] : So what ’s int erest ing is when it ’s not [ disfm arker]
when it ’s set t o " unknown " .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ qw^ rt ] : We − what set t he [ disfm arker] t hey set t he cont ex t t o
" unknown " ?
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e012 [ s] : Right now we haven’t observed it ,
m e012 [ s^ am ] : so I guess it ’s sort of averaging over all t hose t hree
possibilit ies .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ bk] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m e012 [ s^ aa^ df] : But yes ,
m e012 [ s^ na^ rt ] : you can set it t o un " unknown " .
m n015 [ s^ bu] : And if we now do [ disfm arker] leave everyt hing else as
is t he result s should be t he sam e ,
m e003 [ s^ fe^ t 1] : Oops .
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e003 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e012 [ s^ ar] : Well no ,
m e012 [ s.%−−] : because we [ disfm arker] Th − t he way we set t he
probabilit ies [ v ocalsound] m ight not have [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ h] : Yeah ,
m e012 [ s^ ba] : it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s an [ disfm arker] it ’s an issue ,
m e012 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
m e012 [ s.%−] : Like [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Pret t y m uch t he sam e ?
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,

m e012 [ s^ aa] : it is .
m e012 [ s^ rt ] : So t he issue is t hat um in belief − net s , it ’s not
com m on t o do what we did of like having , y ou know , a d bunch of
v alues and t hen " unknown " as an act ual value .
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s] : What ’s com m on is you just like don’t observe t he variable ,
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m e012 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ,
m e012 [ s] : and t hen just m arginalizes [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ b] : Yep .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : But uh [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] We didn’t do t his
because we felt t hat t here ’d [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s] : I guess we were t hinking in t erm s of a swit ch t hat act ually
[ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s.%−−] : We were t hi
m e003 [ b] : Yeah ,
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s.%−] : We were t h
m e012 [ s^ no] : But uh [ disfm arker] I don’t know y what t he right t hing
is t o do for t hat .
m e012 [ s] : I ’m not [ disfm arker] I don’t know if I t ot ally am happy wit h
[ v ocalsound] t he way it is .
m n015 [ qh^ cs.%−−] : Why don’t we [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qy ^ rt .%−−] : Can we ,
m n015 [ fh|qw^ rt ] : um [ disfm arker] How long would it t ake t o
[ disfm arker] t o add anot her [ pause] node on t he observat ory and , um
, play around wit h it ?
m e012 [ qw^ br^ rt ] : Anot her node on what ?
m e003 [ h|s] : Uh , well it depends on how m any t hings it ’s linked t o .
m n015 [ s] : Let ’s just say m ake it really sim ple .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : If we creat e [ pause] som et hing t hat for exam ple would
be um [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : So t h som e t hings can be landm arks in your sense
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : but [ pause] t hey [ pause] can never be ent ered ?
m n015 [ s] : So for ex am ple s a st at ue .
m e012 [ s^ ba] : Good point .
m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Yeah ?
m e003 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : So [ pause] m aybe we wanna have " landm ark "
[ pause] m eaning now " ent erable landm ark " versus , um som et hing
t hat ’s sim ply just a vist a point , for exam ple .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , t hat ’s t rue .
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Yeah ?
m n015 [ s.%−] : uh , a st at ue or um [ disfm arker]

m e012 [ s] : So basically it ’s addressing a variable t hat ’s " ent erable
or not " .
m e012 [ s] : So like an " ent erable , quest ion m ark " .
m e003 [ qy ^ bu^ rt ] : Also [ disfm arker] [ pause] you know , didn’t we
have a [ pause] size as one ?
m e012 [ qw^ br] : What ?
m e003 [ s^ r^ rt ] : The size of t he landm ark .
m e012 [ s^ arp] : Um . Not when we were doing t his ,
m e003 [ s.%−−] : Cuz if it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ b] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s] : but I guess at som e point we did .
m e003 [ s] : For som e reason I had t hat [ disfm arker] OK , t hat was a
t hought t hat I had at one point
m e003 [ s] : but t hen went away .
m e012 [ qy ^ rt ] : So you want t o hav e a [ disfm arker] a node for like
whet her or not it can be ent ered ?
m n015 [ h|s] : Well , for exam ple , if we include t hat ,
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : yeah ?
m n015 [ s] : um , accessibilit y or som et hing ,
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : yeah ?
m e012 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ qy] : " Is it [ disfm arker] Can it be ent ered ? "
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : t hen of course , t his is [ pause] sort of binary as well .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : And t hen um , t here ’s also t he quest ion whet her it m ay be
ent ered .
m n015 [ s] : In t he sense t hat , you know , if it ’s [ pause] Tom
[ disfm arker] t he house of Tom Cruise , you know , it ’s ent erable but
y ou m ay not ent er it .
m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : You know ?
m n015 [ s] : You ’re not allowed t o .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s] : Unless you are , what ever , his [ disfm arker] his div orce
lawy er or som et hing .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Yeah ?
m n015 [ fh|s] : and um [ disfm arker] And t hese are very observable sort
of from t he [ disfm arker] from t he ont ology sort of t hings .
m e003 [ fg] : Way
m e003 [ qy ^ ng] : Does it act ually help t o dist inguish bet ween t hose
t wo cases t hough ?
m e003 [ qr^ e^ rt ] : Whet her it ’s pract ically speaking ent erable , or
act ually phy sically ent erable [ pause] or not ?
fe004 [ s] : It seem s like it would for uh , uh [ pause] det erm ining
whet her t hey wanna go int o it or not .

m n015 [ s.%−−] : y y If [ disfm arker] If y ou ’re running an errand you
m ay be m ore likely t o be able t o ent er places t hat are usually not
[ v ocalsound] al w y ou ’re not usually [ disfm arker] not allowed t o uh m
fe004 [ s.%−] : Cuz t hey [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ aap.%−] : Well I can see why [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ co] : Let ’s get t his uh b clearer .
m n015 [ s] : S so it ’s m at rix bet ween if it ’s not ent erable ,
m e003 [ s^ bu] : Whet her it ’s a [ disfm arker] Whet her it ’s a public
building , and whet her it ’s [ disfm arker] act ually has a door .
m n015 [ s] : period .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n015 [ s^ aa] : exact ly .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s.%−] : This is sort of uh
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s] : So Tom Cruise ’s house is [ pause] not a public building
m e003 [ s] : but it has a door .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m e012 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : But t he t hing is [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s.%−−] : OK , sh
m e003 [ s^ co] : explain t o m e why it ’s necessary [ pause] t o
dist inguish bet ween whet her som et hing has a door and is [ pause] not
public .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : Or , if som et hing [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s.%−−] : It seem s like it ’s equivalent t o say t hat it doesn’t have
a door a [ pause] and it [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s] : Or " not public " and " not a door " are equivalent t hings ,
m e003 [ s] : it seem s like in pract ice .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : So we would have [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qw.%−−] : What does it m ean , t hen , t hat we have t o
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : we hav e an object t ype st at ue .
m n015 [ s] : That really is an object t ype .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s] : So t here is [ disfm arker] t here ’s gonna be a bunch of
st at ues .
m n015 [ s:s] : And t hen we have , for exam ple , an object t ype , [ pause]
hm m , t hat ’s a hot el .
m n015 [ qw] : How about hot els ?
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .

m n015 [ s] : So , t he m ost fam ous building in Heidelberg is act ually a
hot el .
m n015 [ s] : It ’s t he hot el Zum Rit t er ,
m n015 [ s] : which is t he only Renaissance building in Heidelberg t hat
was left aft er [ pause] t he big dest ruct ion and for t he Thirt y Years War ,
blah − blah − blah .
m e003 [ b] : Hm m .
m e003 [ qy ^ j] : Does it have nice walls ?
m n015 [ s^ aa] : It has wonderful walls .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : Ex cellent .
m n015 [ fh|s] : Um − And lot s of det ail , c and carvings , engravings and

m n015 [ fh] : so .
m n015 [ s] : But , um , it ’s st ill an unlikely candidat e for t he Tango

m n015 [ s.%−−] : But . Um . So [ disfm arker] s So if you are a d
m n015 [ s] : Well it ’s very t ricky .
m n015 [ s] : So I guess your quest ion is [ disfm arker] so far I have no

[ disfm arker] st at ues and houses of celebrit ies ,
m n015 [ s] : from t hat point of v iew .
m n015 [ b] : Huh .
m n015 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ cs.%−−] : Let [ disfm arker] Let ’s do a [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ] : Can we add , just so I can see how it ’s done , uh , a "

m n015 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e012 [ qw] : What would it , uh , connect t o ?
m e012 [ qw^ e] : Like , what would , uh , it affect ?
m n015 [ h|s.%−−] : Um , I t hink , um , it m ight affect [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ bu^ rt ] : Oh act ually it ’s [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] [ pause]
it wouldn’t affect any of our nodes ,
m n015 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e012 [ s.%−] : What I was t hinking was if you had a [ disfm arker] like
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : Oh it ’s [ disfm arker] it affect s t h The " doing business " is

m e003 [ s] : You could affect [ disfm arker] [ pause] Theoret ically you

m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Hm m .
m e012 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ bu] : It should , um , inhibit t hat ,

m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m e012 [ s^ no] : I don’t know if JavaBay es is nice about t hat .

m e012 [ s] : of course .
m e012 [ s.%−] : Like , t here ’s t he [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ ba] : Oh m an ,
m e003 [ qy^ rt ] : I didn’t n [ pause] Is t here an am persand in DOS ?

m e012 [ s^ ar] : Nope .
m e012 [ s^ co] : Just s l st art up a new DOS .
m e003 [ s^ ar] : We − That ’s alright .
m e003 [ s] : I can probably double cli click on it .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : Or [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , right .
m n015 [ s^ t 1.%−−] : n uh [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ t 1] : Let ’s see .
m e012 [ b] : Yep .
m e003 [ s^ r^ t 1] : Let ’s see ,
m e003 [ s^ t 1] : com e on .
m e012 [ s] : It ’ll ask y ou what you [ disfm arker] what it want s
[ disfm arker] what you want t o open it wit h and see what BAT , I guess .
m e003 [ s^ j] : One of t hese day s , it should open t his ,
m e003 [ s^ j] : t heoret ically .
m n015 [ s^ co^ rt ] : Go [ disfm arker] Right m ouse .
m n015 [ s^ co^ rt ] : Open wit h .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : That ’s [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ fe] : Oh !
m e003 [ s] : Oh t here we go .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : May be it was just [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ fe] : Oh !
m n015 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e003 [ s] : W Ah , it was dead . To t he world .
fe004 [ s^ fe] : God !
m e003 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : Through t he old Not epad .
m n015 [ s] : That ’s m y favorit e edit or .
m e003 [ s^ rt ] : I like [ disfm arker] I like Word Pad because it has t he uh
[ disfm arker] t he ret urns ,
m n015 [ qy^ br^ rt ] : Wordpad ?
m n015 [ s.%−] : I [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ rt ] : t he carriage ret urns on som e of t hem .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ b] : OK .
m e003 [ s^ rt ] : You know how t hey get " aut o − fills " I guess ,
m n015 [ b] : Mm m − hm m .
m e003 [ s^ rt ] : or what ever you call it .
m e012 [ s^ t c] : Any way , t here it is .
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ] : So t his is sort of LISP − y ?
m n015 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e012 [ h|s^ aa] : Uh , Yeah .
m e003 [ s] : It just basically looks like it just specifies a bunch of
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s] : That ’s how act ual probabilit y t ables are specified .

m e012 [ s] : As , like , list s of num bers .
m e003 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s] : So t heoret ically you could edit t hat .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : It just t hat [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s] : But [ pause] t hey ’re not very friendly .
m e003 [ fg|s.%−] : Yeah t he ordering isn’t very clear on [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m e012 [ s.%−] : So y ou ’d have t o like figure out [ disfm arker] Like you
have t o go and [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ 2] : The layout [ pause] of t he t able .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s.%−] : Well I [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ cs] : Act ually we could writ e a program t hat could generat e
t his .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s^ am ] : I t hink so .
fe004 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : You could .
m e003 [ s^ df] : Yeah you could .
m e012 [ s.%−] : it ’s not [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s.%−] : We were doing it [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ fg] : Yeah
m e012 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : we can m aybe writ e an int erface t h for uh ent ering
probabilit y dist ribut ions easily ,
m e012 [ s^ e] : som et hing like [ disfm arker] like a lit t le script .
m e012 [ s^ df] : That m ight [ vocalsound] be wort h it .
m n015 [ s^ am ] : And t hat m ight do .
fe004 [ fg] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s] : I act ually seem t o recall Srini com plaining about som et hing
t o do wit h Ent ering probabilit y
fe004 [ s.%−] : so t his is probably
m e012 [ s] : The ot her t hing is it is in Java
fe004 [ %−] : Yeah , it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m e012 [ fg] : so .
m e003 [ qy^ 2^ bu^ rt ] : We could [ pause] m anipulat e t he source
[ pause] it self ?
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m e003 [ %−] : Or [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qy^ rt ] : Do you have t he t rue source files
m e003 [ s^ no.%−] : I don’t know if he act ually [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ qrr] : or just t he class ?
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

m e012 [ s^ aa] : Uh , yeah . we do
m e003 [ qy .%−] : Does he [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I saw direct ory called " source " ,
m e003 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : I didn’t e
m e012 [ %−] : or [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s^ co^ rt ] : Go up one ?
m e003 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Up one .
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s^ ba] : Ah yes , good .
m e003 [ s] : " Source " .
m e003 [ s^ ba] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s quit e nice .
m e012 [ s^ no] : I don’t know if it act ually m anipulat e t he source ,
t hough .
m e012 [ s] : That m ight be a bit com plicat ed .
m e012 [ s^ cs.%−−] : I t hink it m ight [ disfm arker] it m ight be sim pler t o
just [ pause] hav e a script t hat , you know [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s] : It ’s , like , friendly ,
fe004 [ s] : The d t he dat a t ables .
m e012 [ s] : it allows you ent er t hings well .
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : But if t h if t here is an XML [ pause] file t hat [ disfm arker]
or form at t hat it can also read [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : I m ean it just reads t his ,
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g] : right ?
m n015 [ s] : When it st art s .
m e012 [ fg] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s] : Yeah I know t here is an [ disfm arker] I was looking on t he
we web page
m e003 [ s] : and he ’s updat ed it for an XML version of I guess Bayes −

m e003 [ s] : There ’s a Bayes − net spec for [ disfm arker] in XML .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ qy^ bu^ rt ] : He ’s [ disfm arker] Like t his guy has ?
m e012 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ g^ rt ] : The Jav aBayes guy ?
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] but , e he doesn’t use it .
m e012 [ qw] : So in what sense has he updat ed it ?
m e003 [ s] : Well t h you can eit her [ disfm arker] you ca or you can read
bot h .
m e012 [ s^ bk] : Oh . I see .
m e003 [ s] : To m y underst anding .

m e012 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e012 [ s^ ba] : That would be awesom e .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : Because uh [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s.%−−] : Well at least t he [ disfm arker] uh [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : I could have m isread t he web page ,
m e003 [ s] : I have a habit of doing t hat ,
m e003 [ fh] : but .
m n015 [ s^ ba] : OK , wonderful .
m e012 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ qy ^ rt ^ t c] : So you got m ore slides ?
m e003 [ s^ m ] : Do I have m ore slides ?
m e003 [ h|s] : Um yes ,
m e003 [ s] : one m ore .
m e003 [ s] : " Fut ure Work " .
m e003 [ s^ cs] : I t hink every present at ion have a should have a "
Fut ure Work " slide .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : But uh it ’s basically [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : we already t alked about all t his st uff ,
m e003 [ fh] : so .
m e012 [ s] : Um . The addit ional t hing is I guess learning t he
probabilit ies , [ pause] also .
m e012 [ s.%−−] : E That ’s m aybe ,
m e012 [ s^ no.%−] : I don’t know [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] If
[ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ aap] : Uh t hat ’s fut ure fut ure work .
m e012 [ %−] : Does [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s.%−] : That ’s [ disfm arker]
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m e012 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Very fut ure .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ s:s] : And of course if y ou have a present at ion t hat doesn’t
[ disfm arker] hav e som et hing t hat doesn’t work at all , t hen you have "
What I learned " , as a slide .
fe004 [ qy ^ bu] : Can’t you have bot h ?
m e003 [ s^ aa^ rt ] : You could .
m e003 [ s] : My first approach failed .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m e003 [ s] : What I learned .
m e003 [ s^ t ^ t c] : OK , so I t hink t hat uh our present at ion ’s finished .
m n015 [ s^ ba] : Good .
m e003 [ s] : I know what I like about t hese m eet ings is one person will
nod , and t hen t he next person will nod , and t hen it just goes all t he
way around t he room .
m n015 [ fg] : So t he uh [ disfm arker]

fe004 [ s^ j] : I m issed m y t urn .
m e003 [ s] : No I [ disfm arker] Earlier I went [ nonvocalsound] and
Bhaskara went [ nonv ocalsound] and you did it .
m e003 [ s] : You did it .
m n015 [ s^ aa^ m ] : It ’s like yawning .
fe004 [ s] : It ’s like yawning .
m n015 [ s] : And t his announcem ent was in st ereo .
m e012 [ s^ fe] : Ha .
m n015 [ fg] : OK .
m n015 [ s.%−] : So t his m eans um [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ qy ^ rt ] : Should I pull up t he [ pause] net again ?
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ qy ^ rt ] : Could you put t he [ disfm arker] t he um , net up again ?
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe004 [ s^ ft ] : Thanks .
m e003 [ s] : There we go .
m e003 [ s^ t 1.%−] : And act ually I was [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ t 1] : cuz I got a wireless m ike on .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : So a m ore general t hing t han " discussed adm ission fee
" um , could be [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] I ’m just wondering whet her t he cont ext ,
t he background cont ext of t he discourse [ vocalsound] m ight be
[ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s^ no] : I don’t know ,
fe004 [ s] : if t here ’s a way t o define it or m aybe you know generalize it
som e way
fe004 [ s:s] : um , t here m ight be ot her cues t hat , say , um , in t he last
few ut t erances t here has been som et hing t hat has st rongly
associat ed wit h say one of t he part icular m odes
fe004 [ s.%−−] : uh , I don’t know if t hat m ight be [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ fg|s] : uh , and [ disfm arker] and int o t hat node would be
v arious [ disfm arker] v arious t hings t hat [ disfm arker] t hat could have
specifically com e up .
m n015 [ s.%−] : I t hink we [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s.%−−] : I t hink a [ disfm arker] a sort of general st rat egy here
[ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s.%−−] : You know , t his is [ disfm arker] t his is excellent because
[ disfm arker] um it get s you t hinking along t hese t erm s [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : is t hat m aybe we ob we could observe a couple of um
discourse phenom ena such as t he adm ission fee ,
m n015 [ s] : and som et hing else and som et hing else , t hat happened
in t he discourse before .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Right .
m n015 [ fh|s] : And um [ disfm arker] let ’s m ake t hose four .

m n015 [ s.%−−] : And m aybe t here are t wo um [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : So m ay be t his could be sort of a separat e region of t he
net , [ pause] which has t wo [ disfm arker] [ pause] has it ’s own m iddle
lay er .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : Maybe t his , you know , has som e [ pause] kind [ pause]
of um , funky t hing t hat di
m n015 [ s.%−−] : if t his
m n015 [ s] : and t his m ay influence t hese hidden nodes of t he
discourse
m n015 [ s] : which is m aybe som et hing t hat is uh , a m ore general
v ersion of t he act ual [ pause] phenom enon t hat you can observe .
m n015 [ s.%−] : So t hings t hat point t owards [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s^ bs.%−−:s.%−−] : So inst ead of single node , for [ pause] like , if
t hey said t he word " adm ission fee " [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Exact ly .
fe004 [ b] : Yeah .
m e003 [ s] : " adm ission fee " , or m aybe , you know , " how m uch t o
ent er "
m e003 [ s] : or you know som et hing ,
fe004 [ s^ 2^ rt ] : Opening hours or som et hing like t hat .
m e003 [ s] : ot her cues .
m e003 [ s^ aa] : Exact ly .
m e003 [ s] : That would all f funnel int o one node t hat would [ pause]
const it ut e ent rance requirem ent s or som et hing like t hat .
m n015 [ s^ bu.%−:s.%−] : So " pay a visit " [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ %−] : uh uh d
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah .
m n015 [ qy^ bh] : Yeah ?
fe004 [ s] : I m ean it sort of get int o plan recognit ion kinds of t hings in
t he discourse .
fe004 [ s] : I m ean t hat ’s like t he bigger um , version of it .
m n015 [ fg] : Exact ly .
m n015 [ fg] : Yeah ?
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : And t hen m aybe t here are som e discourse act s if t hey
happened before ,
m n015 [ s] : um it ’s m ore for um a cue t hat t he person act ually want s
t o get som ewhere else
m n015 [ s] : and t hat you are in a [ disfm arker] in a [ disfm arker] in a
rout e
m n015 [ s] : um , sort of proceeding past t hese t hings ,
m n015 [ s] : so t his would be just som et hing t hat [ disfm arker] where
y ou want t o pass it .
m n015 [ b] : Hm m ?
m n015 [ qy^ d^ g] : Is t hat it ?

m n015 [ s.%−−] : However t hese are of course t hen
m n015 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] t he nodes , t he observ ed nodes , for your
m iddle lay er .
m n015 [ s:s] : So t his [ pause] again point s t o " final dest inat ion " , "
doing business " , " t ourist hurry " and so fort h .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e003 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Yeah ?
m n015 [ s:s] : And so t hen we can say , " OK .
m n015 [ s.%−] : we have a whole [ pause] region [ disfm arker] "
[ v ocalsound] in a e
fe004 [ s^ bu] : That ’s a whole set of discourse relat ed cues t o your
m iddle lay er .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , exact ly .
fe004 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m n015 [ s] : And t his is just [ disfm arker] t hen just one .
m n015 [ s] : So e because at t he end t he m ore we um [ disfm arker] add
, you know , t he m ore spider − web − ish it ’s going t o becom e in t he
m iddle and t he m ore of hand edit ing .
m n015 [ s] : It ’s going t o get very ugly .
m n015 [ s] : But wit h t his way we could say " OK , t hese are t he [ pause]
discourse phenom ena .
m n015 [ s] : They ra m ay have t here own hidden layer [ pause] t hat
point s t o som e of [ pause] t he [ disfm arker] t he real hidden layer , um
or t he general hidden layer .
m e012 [ b] : Sure .
m n015 [ s] : And t he sam e we will be able t o do for synt act ic
inform at ion ,
m n015 [ s^ e] : t he verbs used , t he object t ypes used , m odifiers .
m n015 [ s] : And m ay be t here ’s a hidden layer for t hat .
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m n015 [ s] : And so fort h and so fort h .
m n015 [ s] : Then we have cont ext .
m e012 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s^ bu] : So essent ially a lot of t hose nodes can be expanded
int o lit t le Bayes − net s of t heir own .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Precisely .
m n015 [ fh] : So .
m e003 [ s.%−−] : One t hing t hat ’s kind of been bugging m e when I
[ disfm arker] m ore I look at t his is t hat t he [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ s] : I guess , t he fact t hat t he [ disfm arker] t here ’s a com plet e
separat ion bet ween t he [ pause] observed feat ures and in t he out put .
m e012 [ s^ am ] : Yeah .

m e003 [ s^ df.%−−] : I m ean , it m akes it cleaner , but t hen uh
[ disfm arker] I m ean .
m e012 [ s^ aa] : That ’s t rue .
m e003 [ s.%−] : For inst ance if t he discourse does [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ qw^ rt ] : What do you m ean by t hat ?
m e003 [ s.%−−] : well for inst ance , t he " discourse adm ission fee "
[ pause] node seem s like it should point direct ly t o t he [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e003 [ s^ rt :s] : or increase t he probabilit y of " ent er [ pause] direct ly "
v ersus " going t here via t ourist " .
m e012 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e012 [ s^ cs] : Or we could like add m ore , uh , sort of m iddle nodes .
m e012 [ s:qw] : Like we could add a node like do t hey want t o ent er it ,
m e012 [ s] : which is affect ed by adm ission fee and by whet her it ’s
closed and by whet her it has a door .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e012 [ s] : So it ’s like [ disfm arker] There are [ disfm arker] Those are
t he t wo opt ions .
m e003 [ b] : Right .
m e012 [ s] : Eit her like m ake an arrow direct ly or put a new node .
fe004 [ b] : Hm m .
m e003 [ b] : Yeah ,
m e003 [ s^ ba] : t hat m akes sense .
m n015 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n015 [ s:qw] : And if it [ disfm arker] if you do it [ disfm arker] If you
could connect it t oo hard you m ay get such phenom enon t hat
[ disfm arker] like " So how m uch has it cost t o ent er ? "
m n015 [ s] : and t he answer is t wo hundred fift y dollars ,
m n015 [ s:s] : and t hen t he persons says um " Yeah I want t o see it . "
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Yeah ?
m n015 [ s:s] : m eaning " It ’s way out of m y budget "
m n015 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ qy ^ d] : There are places in Germ any where it cost s t wo
hundred fift y dollars t o ent er ?
m n015 [ h|s^ ar] : Um , not hing com es t o m ind .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : Wit hout t hinking t oo hard .
m n015 [ s^ am .%−−] : Um , m aybe ,
m n015 [ s^ aa] : y eah of course ,
m n015 [ s] : um opera prem iers .
m e003 [ qy^ bh] : Really ?
m n015 [ s.%−−] : So y ou know .
fe004 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ s] : Or [ disfm arker] or any good old Pink Floyd concert .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e003 [ s^ rt :s] : If you want t o see " The Magic Flut e " or som et hing .
m n015 [ b] : Yeah .

fe004 [ s] : Or m aybe um , a fam ous rest aurant .
fe004 [ s^ no] : or , I don’t know .
fe004 [ s] : There are various t hings t hat y ou m ight w not want t o eat a
[ pause] m eal t here but [ pause] your own t able .
m e003 [ s] : The Spagos of Heidelberg .
m n015 [ s] : I t hink t hat t he h I m ean not hing beat s t he [ disfm arker]
t he adm ission charge prices in Japan .
m n015 [ s] : So t here , t wo hundred dollars is [ disfm arker] is m oderat e
for get t ing int o a discot heque .
m n015 [ s^ d^ f] : You know .
m e012 [ qy ^ bh] : Really .
m n015 [ s] : Then again , every t hing else is free t hen once you ’re ins in
t here .
m n015 [ s] : Food and drink and so fort h .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : So . I m ean .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : But i you know , i we can [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s.%−−] : Som et hing [ disfm arker] Som ebody can have discussed
t he adm ission fee and u t he answer [ pause] is s if we [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : um , you know , um [ disfm arker] st ill , based on t hat result
is nev er going t o ent er t hat building .
m e003 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ s^ f] : You know ?
m n015 [ s] : Because it ’s just t oo expensive .
m e003 [ fg] : Oh yeah ,
m e003 [ s] : I t hink I see .
m e003 [ s^ bu] : So t he discourse refers t o " adm ission fee " but it just
t urns out t hat t hey change t heir m ind in t he m iddle of t he discourse .
fe004 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : you have t o have som e not ion of not just [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : I m ean t here ’s a [ disfm arker] t here ’s change across
sev eral t urns of discourse
m e003 [ b] : Right .
fe004 [ s^ no] : so [ vocalsound] I don’t know how [ disfm arker] if any of
t his was discussed [ disfm arker] but how i if it all t his is going t o
int eract wit h [ vocalsound] what ever general [ vocalsound] uh , ot her
[ disfm arker] ot her discourse processing t hat m ight be happen .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : I m ean .
m e012 [ b] : Yeah . [ com m ent ] [ nonvocalsound] Yeah .
m e003 [ qw.%−−] : What sort of discourse [ pause] processing is uh
[ disfm arker] are t he [ disfm arker]
m e003 [ qw.%−−] : How m uch is built int o Sm art Kom and [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : It works like t his .
m n015 [ s.%−−] : The uh , um [ disfm arker] I m ean .

m n015 [ s.%−−] : The first t hing we get is t hat [ pause] already t he
int ent ion is sort of t
m n015 [ s] : They t ried t o figure out t he int ent ion ,
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n015 [ s] : sim ply by parsing it .
m n015 [ s] : And t his um [ disfm arker] m won’t different iat e bet ween all
m odes ,
m n015 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : yeah ?
m n015 [ s.%−−] : but at least it ’ll t ell us " OK here we have som et hing
t hat [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : som ebody t hat want s t o go som eplace ,
m n015 [ s] : now it ’s up for us t o figure out what kind of going t here is
[ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] [ pause] is happening ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : and um , if t he discourse t akes a couple of t urns
before every t hing [ disfm arker] all t he inform at ion is needed ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : what happens is y ou know t he parser parses it
m n015 [ s] : and t hen it ’s handed on t o t he discourse hist ory which is ,
um o one of t he m ost elaborat e [ disfm arker] elaborat e m odules .
m n015 [ s] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s act ually t he [ disfm arker] t he whole
m em ory of t he ent ire syst em , t hat knows what [ disfm arker] wh who
said what , which was [ disfm arker] what was present ed .
m n015 [ s] : It helps an an anaphora resolut ion and it [ disfm arker] and
it fills in all t he st ruct ures t hat are om it t ed ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : so , [ pause] um ,
m n015 [ s:qw] : because you say " OK , [ pause] how can I get t o t he
cast le ?
m n015 [ s:qw] : " Oh , how [ disfm arker] how m uch is it ? "
m n015 [ s:s] : and um " yeah I would like uh [ disfm arker] um
[ disfm arker] t o g let ’s do it " and so fort h .
m n015 [ s] : So ev en wit hout an a ana [ pause] anaphora som ebody
has t o m ake sure t hat inform at ion we had earlier on is st ill here .
m e003 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : Because not every m odule keeps a m em ory of everyt hing
t hat happened .
m n015 [ s] : so [ v ocalsound] whenev er t he uh , um person is not
act ually reject ing what happened before ,
m n015 [ s:s] : so as in " No I really don’t want t o see t hat m ovie .
m n015 [ s:s] : I ’d rat her st ay hom e and wat ch TV "
m n015 [ fh|s] : um [ disfm arker] What m ovie was select ed in what
cinem a in what t own is [ disfm arker] is going t o be sort of added int o
t he disc int o t he represent at ions ev ery di at each dialogue st ep , by
t he discourse m odel [ disfm arker] discourse [ pause] m odel ,
m n015 [ s^ t 1] : Yeah , t hat ’s what it ’s called .
m n015 [ s^ t 1] : and , um , it does som e help in t he anaphora
resolut ion

m n015 [ s] : and it also helps in coordinat ing t he gest ure screen issues
.
m n015 [ s.%−−] : So a person point ing t o som et hing on t he screen , you
know ,
m e003 [ b] : Hm m .
m n015 [ s] : t he discourse m odel act ually st ores what was present ed
at what locat ion on t he s on t he screen
m n015 [ s] : so it ’s a [ disfm arker] it ’s a rat her huge [ vocalsound]
[ disfm arker] huge t hing
m n015 [ fh|s.%−−] : but um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] [ com m ent ] um
[ disfm arker] [ pause] [ vocalsound] we can [ pause] sort of [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ s] : It has a v ery clear int erface .
m n015 [ s] : We can query it whet her adm ission fees were discussed in
t he last t urn
m n015 [ s.%−−] : and [ disfm arker] and t he t urn before t hat or you know
m n015 [ s.%−−] : how [ pause] deep we want t o search
m e003 [ b] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : um [ disfm arker] which is a quest ion .
m n015 [ qh] : How deep do we want t o sear ,
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : you know ?
m n015 [ fh|s] : Um [ disfm arker] but we should [ pause] t ry t o keep in
m ind t hat , y ou know , we ’re doing t his sort of for research ,
m n015 [ s] : so we [ disfm arker] we should find a lim it t hat ’s reasonable
and not go , you know , all t he way back t o Adam and Eve .
m n015 [ qh] : You know , did t hat person ever discuss adm issions fee
[ disfm arker] fees in his ent ire life ?
m n015 [ s] : And t he dialogues are pret t y [ disfm arker] pret t y you know
[ v ocalsound] concise
m n015 [ s.%−−] : and [ disfm arker]
m n015 [ fh] : Anyway .
fe004 [ s] : So one t hing t hat m ight be helpful which is im plicit in t he
[ pause] use of " adm ission fee discussion " as a cue for ent ry ,
[ v ocalsound] [ pause] is t hinking about t he plans t hat various people

fe004 [ s] : Like all t he different [ vocalsound] sort of general schem as
t hat t hey m ight be following
fe004 [ fh] : OK .
fe004 [ s^ rt ] : This person is um , finding out inform at ion about t his
t hing in order t o go [ pause] in as a t ourist or finding out how t o get t o
t his place [ pause] in order t o do business .
fe004 [ s^ rt ] : Um , because t hen [ pause] anyt hing t hat ’s a cue for
one of t he st eps [ pause] would be slight evidence for t hat overall plan
.
fe004 [ s^ no] : Um , I don’t know .

fe004 [ s] : They ’re [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in non in sort of m ore
t radit ional AI kinds of plan recognit ion t hings you sort of have

fe004 [ qh] : " OK , wha what plans is t his a [ disfm arker] consist ent wit h

fe004 [ s] : and t hen get s som e m ore inform at ion and t hen you see
[ pause] " here ’s a sequence t hat t his sort of roughly fit s int o " .
fe004 [ s^ am ] : It [ disfm arker] it m ight be useful here t oo .
fe004 [ s.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know how
m n015 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s] : y ou know you ’d hav e t o [ vocalsound] [ pause] figure out

m n015 [ fh|s] : so [ v ocalsound] m aybe what [ disfm arker] what
[ disfm arker] what happened [ disfm arker] what m ight happen is t hat
we do get t his sort of t ask − based m iddle layer ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n015 [ s] : Bu − e e e I ’m even [ disfm arker] This [ disfm arker] t his
Tango , Ent er , Vist a is sort of , it self , an ad − hoc scenario .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he basic u um idea behind t he uh
[ pause] dat a collect ion was t he following .

,
m n015 [ s] : sim ple linguist ic st uff .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : Hardly anyt hing com plicat ed .
m n015 [ s] : No m et aphors what soev er .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : Not a rich language .
m n015 [ s] : So we want ed just t o collect dat a , t o get [ disfm arker] t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ pause] elicit s m ore , uh , t hat
elicit s richer language .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s] : And we act ually did not want t o const rain it t oo m uch ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : you know ?
m n015 [ s] : Just see what people say .
m n015 [ s] : And t hen m aybe we ’ll discover t he phenom enon
[ disfm arker] t he phenom ena t hat we want t o solve , you know , wit h
[ pause] what ev er engine we [ disfm arker] we com e up wit h .
m n015 [ fh|s] : Um . So t his [ disfm arker] t his [ disfm arker] t his is a
parallel t rack ,
fe004 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s] : you know , t here [ disfm arker] t hey hopefully m eet ,
fe004 [ s^ bs] : So in ot her words t his dat a collect ion is [ pause] m ore
general .
m n015 [ s.%−] : but since [ disfm arker]
fe004 [ s] : It could [ disfm arker] it could [ pause] be used for not just
t his t ask .

m n015 [ s] : It should t ell us , you know , what kind of phenom enon
could occur ,
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : it should t ell us also m aybe som et hing about t he
difference bet ween people who t hink t hey speak t o a com put er versus
people who t hink t hey speak t o a hum an being
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ rt ] : and t he sort of differences t here .
m n015 [ s] : So it m ay get us som e m ore inform at ion on t he hum an −
m achine pragm at ics , um , t hat no one knows anyt hing about , as of
y est erday .
m n015 [ s] : And uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] not hing has changed
[ com m ent ] since t hen ,
m n015 [ s.%−−] : so .
m n015 [ fg|s] : Uh . And secondly , now t hat of course we have sort of
st art ed t o lick blood wit h t his ,

can’t st op Tango − ing , [ vocalsound] we m ay act ually include , you
know , t hose [ disfm arker] t hose int ent ions .
m n015 [ s^ cs.%−−] : So now I t hink we should m aybe hav e at least one
navigat ional t ask wit h [ disfm arker] wit h sort of explicit [ disfm arker] uh
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ bsc] : not ex it ’s im plicit t hat t he person want s t o ent er ,
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : and m aybe som e t ask where it ’s m ore or less explicit

fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n015 [ s^ e] : or see it or som et hing .
m n015 [ s] : So t hat we can label it .
m n015 [ s] : I m ean , t hat ’s how we get a corpus t hat we can label .
fe004 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe004 [ s^ bk] : Ex act ly .
m n015 [ s] : Whereas , you know , if we ’d just get dat a we ’d never
know what t hey act ually want ed ,
m n015 [ s] : we ’d get no cues .
m n015 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e003 [ s^ bk] : Alright y .
m e012 [ s^ rt ^ t c] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ rt ^ t c] : That was t hat .
m e003 [ qy ^ rt ^ t c] : So is t his t he official end of t he m eet ing now ?
m e012 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
fe004 [ s] : Looks like it .
m e012 [ qw] : So what ’s " Econom ics , t he fallacy " ?
m e003 [ s] : I just random ly [ pause] label t hings .
m n015 [ %−] : Ma
m e003 [ s] : So t hat has not hing t o do wit h econom ics or anyt hing .
m e012 [ qy ^ bh] : Oh , really ?

m e012 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n015 [ s^ cs] : May be we ought t o swit ch off t hese t hings before we
