m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So , I m ean , everyone who ’s on t he wireless
check t hat t hey ’re on .
m n017 [ %−] : C we [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s^ bk] : Alright .
fe008 [ s^ bk^ t 3] : I see .
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fg|s^ t ^ t c] : OK , our agenda was quit e short .
m e013 [ fg|qy ^ rt ] : Oh , could you [ pause] close t he door , m aybe ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Two it em s , which was , uh , digit s and possibly st uff on
[ disfm arker] on , uh , forced alignm ent ,
m e011 [ s] : which Jane said t hat Liz and Andreas had in inform at ion on
,
m e013 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : but t hey didn’t ,
m e011 [ fh] : so .
m e013 [ s.%−] : I guess t he only ot her t hing , uh , for which I
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ cs] : We should do t hat second ,
m n017 [ s^ df] : because Liz m ight join us in t im e for t hat .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : OK .
m e013 [ fg] : Um .
m e013 [ fh|s^ t ] : OK , so t here ’s digit s , alignm ent s ,
m e013 [ fh] : and , um ,
m e013 [ s^ t ] : I guess t he ot her t hing , [ vocalsound] which I cam e
unprepared for , uh , [ vocalsound] is , uh , t o dis s s see if t here ’s
anyt hing anybody want s t o discuss about t he Sat urday m eet ing .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s] : Any [ disfm arker] I m ean , m aybe not .
m e011 [ s] : Digit s and alignm ent s .
m e011 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m n017 [ s] : Talk about aligning people ’s schedules .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa.%] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−] : Yeah , I m ean , it was [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah , it ’s forced alignm ent of people ’s schedules .

m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s.%−] : If we ’re very [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s] : Forced align .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : Wit h [ disfm arker] wit h [ disfm arker] what ever it was , a
m ont h and a half or som et hing ahead of t im e , t he only t im e we could
find in com m on [ disfm arker] roughly in com m on , was on a Sat urday .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ b] : Ugh .
m n017 [ s^ ba] : It ’s pret t y sad .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe008 [ qy ^ cs] : Hav e [ disfm arker] Have we t hought about having a
conference call t o include him in m ore of [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] in
m ore of t he m eet ing ?
fe008 [ s^ bd^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I m ean , I don’t know ,
fe008 [ s^ cs.%−] : if we had t he [ disfm arker] if we had t he t elephone on
t he t able [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e013 [ s] : But , h I m ean , he probably has t o go do som et hing .
m n017 [ s^ ar|s] : No , act ually I [ disfm arker] I have t o [ disfm arker] I
have t o shut t le [ pause] kids from various places t o various ot her
places .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
fe008 [ s^ bk] : I see . OK .
m n017 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : And I don’t have [ disfm arker] and I don’t , um , have a cell
phone
m n014 [ qy^ br^ d^ rt ] : A cell phone ?
m n017 [ s] : so I can’t be having a conference call while driving .
fe008 [ s^ ar|s^ ba] : No . [ com m ent ] It ’s not good .
m e013 [ fg] : R r right .
fe008 [ s^ ba^ r] : That ’s not good .
m e013 [ s.%−] : So we have t o [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : Plus , it would m ake for int erest ing noise [ disfm arker]
background noise .
m e013 [ %] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m n017 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So we have t o equip him wit h a [ disfm arker] wit h a
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] wit h a head − m ount ed , uh , cell phone
m e011 [ fg|s^ cs^ j] : Ye − we and we ’d have t o force you t o read lot s
and lot s of digit s ,

m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ aa^ j] : Oh , yeah .
m e011 [ s^ df] : so it could get real [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] real car
noise .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Oh , yeah .
m e001 [ s^ j^ na] : Take advant age .
m n014 [ s^ na] : And wit h t he kids in t he background .
m n017 [ s.%−] : I ’ll let [ disfm arker] I ’d let [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ j] : I let , uh , m y fiv e − year − old have a t ry at t he digit s ,
m n017 [ fh] : eh .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fg|s^ t ^ t c] : So , anyway , I can t alk about digit s .
m e011 [ qr] : Um , did everyone get t he result s or shall I go over t hem
again ?
m e011 [ s] : I m ean t hat it was basically [ disfm arker] t he only t hing t hat
was ev en slight ly surprising was t hat t he lapel did so well .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : Um , and in ret rospect t hat ’s not as surprising as
m ay be i
m e011 [ s] : it shouldn’t have been as surprising as I [ disfm arker] as
[ disfm arker] as I felt it was .
m e011 [ s] : The lapel m ike is a very high − qualit y m icrophone .
m e011 [ s] : And as Morgan point ed out , t hat t here are act ually som e
advant ages t o it in t erm s of breat h noises and clot hes rust ling [ pause]
if no one else is t alking .
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Exact ly .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e001 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ fh] : Um , so , uh [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ %−] : It ’s g it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s] : Well , it ’s [ disfm arker] Yeah , sort of t he bre t he breat h
noises and t he m out h clicks and so fort h like t hat , t he lapel ’s gonna
be bet t er on .
m n014 [ s] : Or t he cross − t alk .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : The lapel is t ypically worse on t he [ disfm arker] on clot hes
rust ling ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : but if no one ’s rust ling t heir clot hes ,
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Right . I m ean , a lot of people are just sort of
leaning ov er and reading t he digit s ,
m e013 [ %−] : it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : so it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s a very different t ask t han sort of
t he nat ural .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ na] : You don’t m ove m uch during reading digit s , I t hink .

m e011 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e001 [ s] : Probably t he fact t hat it picks up ot her people ’s speakers
[ disfm arker] ot her people ’s t alking is an indicat ion of t hat it
[ disfm arker] t he fact it is a good m icrophone .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s] : Right . So in t he digit s , in m ost [ disfm arker] m ost
cases , t here weren’t ot her people t alking .
m e001 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ qy^ rt ] : D do t he lapel m ikes have any direct ionalit y t o t hem ?
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s^ nd|s^ ar] : There t ypically don’t , no .
m n017 [ s^ df] : Because I [ disfm arker] I suppose you could m ake som e
t hat hav e sort of [ disfm arker] t hat you have t o orient t owards your
m out h ,
m n017 [ s.%−] : and t hen it would [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : They hav e a lit t le bit ,
m e011 [ s] : but t hey ’re not noise − cancelling .
m e011 [ fh] : So , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : They ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re int ended t o be om ni −
direct ional .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And t h it ’s [ disfm arker] and because you don’t know how
people are gonna put t hem on , you know .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ fg|s] : So , also , Andreas , on t hat one t he [ disfm arker] t he
back part of it should be right against y our head .
m e011 [ s^ e] : And t hat will he keep it from flopping aro up and down
as m uch .
m n017 [ s] : It is against m y head .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Um . Yeah , we act ually t alked about t his in t he , uh ,
front − end m eet ing t his m orning , t oo .
m e011 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s^ e] : Much t he sam e t hing ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and [ disfm arker] and it was [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s^ rt ] : uh , I m ean , t here t he point of int erest t o t he group
was prim arily t hat , um , [ vocalsound] t he , uh [ disfm arker] t he syst em
t hat we had t hat was based on H T K , t hat ’s used by , you know ,
[ pause] all t he part icipant s in Aurora , [ vocalsound] was so m uch
worse [ vocalsound] t han t he [ disfm arker] t han t he S R
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Ev ery body .
m e013 [ s] : And t he int erest ing t hing is t hat even t hough ,
[ v ocalsound] yes , it ’s a digit s t ask and t hat ’s a relat ively sm all
num ber of words and t here ’s a bunch of digit s t hat you t rain on ,
[ v ocalsound] it ’s just not as good as hav ing a [ disfm arker] a l very
large am ount of dat a and t raining up a [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a
nice good big [ v ocalsound] HMM .
m e013 [ s] : Um , also you had t he adapt at ion in t he SRI syst em , which
we didn’t have in t his .
m e013 [ fh] : Um . So . Um .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : And we know [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ qy ^ rt ] : Di − did I send you som e result s wit hout adapt at ion ?
m e011 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e011 [ s] : Or if you did , I didn’t include t hem ,
m e013 [ s] : I s I t hink St ephane , uh , had seen t hem .
m e011 [ s^ df.%−] : cuz it was [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ df] : Yeah , I t hink I did , act ually .
m n017 [ s] : So t here was a significant loss from not doing t he
adapt at ion .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ fh] : Um .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : A [ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] a couple percent or som e
m n017 [ %−−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ %−−] : Well , I don’t know it [ disfm arker] Overall [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ no] : Uh , I [ disfm arker] I don’t rem em ber ,
m n017 [ s] : but t here was [ disfm arker] [ nonvocalsound] t here was a
significant , um , loss or win [ com m ent ] from adapt at ion [ disfm arker]
wit h [ disfm arker] wit h adapt at ion .
m n017 [ fh] : And , um ,
m n017 [ s] : t hat was t he phone − loop adapt at ion .
m n017 [ s] : And t hen t here was a very sm all [ disfm arker] like point one
percent on t he nat ives [ disfm arker] uh , win from doing , um , you know
, adapt at ion t o [ pause] t he recognit ion hypot heses .
m n017 [ s] : And [ pause] I t ried bot h m eans adapt at ion and m eans and
v ariances ,
m n017 [ s] : and t he variances added anot her [ disfm arker] or
subt ract ed anot her point one percent .
m n017 [ s] : So , [ v ocalsound] it ’s , um [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he num ber
t here .

m n017 [ s] : Point six , I believe , is what you get wit h bot h , uh , m eans
and variance adapt at ion .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But I t hink one t hing is t hat , uh , I would presum e
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy^ rt ] : Hav − Have you ever t [ vocalsound] Have you ever t ried
t his ex act sam e recognizer out on t he act ual TI − digit s t est set ?
m n017 [ qw^ br] : This exact sam e recognizer ?
m n017 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : It m ight be int erest ing t o do t hat .
m e013 [ s^ df.%−−] : Cuz m y [ disfm arker] m y [ disfm arker] cuz m y sense ,
m e013 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but , I have [ disfm arker] I m ean , people
[ disfm arker] people at SRI are act ually working on digit s .
m e011 [ s] : I bet it would do even slight ly bet t er .
m n017 [ s] : I could [ disfm arker] and t hey are using a syst em t hat ’s ,
um [ disfm arker] y ou know , h is act ually t rained on digit s ,
m n017 [ s^ df] : um , but h h ot herwise uses t he sam e , you know ,
decoder , t he sam e , uh , t raining m et hods , and so fort h ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s^ cs] : and I could ask t hem what t hey get [ pause] on TI −
digit s .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ cs^ ng] : Yeah , bu alt hough I ’d be [ disfm arker] I t hink
it ’d be int erest ing t o just t ake t his exact act ual syst em
m e013 [ s^ df] : so t hat t hese num bers were com parable
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s] : Well , Adam knows how t o run it ,
m e013 [ s^ cs^ e] : and t ry it out on TI − digit s .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ ba] : Yeah . No problem .
m n017 [ s.%−] : so you just m ake a f
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df.%−−] : Cuz our sense from t he ot her [ disfm arker] from t he
Aurora , uh , t ask is t hat [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : And t ry it wit h TI − digit s ?
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ df] : I m ean , cuz we were get t ing sub one percent
[ v ocalsound] num bers on TI − digit s also wit h t he t andem t hing .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s] : So , [ vocalsound] one [ disfm arker] so t here were a
num ber of t hings we not ed from t his .
m e013 [ s] : One is , yeah , t he SRI syst em is a lot bet t er t han t he HTK
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ b] : Hm m .

m e013 [ s] : t his , you know , very lim it ed t raining HTK syst em .
m n017 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , but t he ot her is t hat , um , t he digit s [ vocalsound]
recorded here in t his room wit h t hese close m ikes , i uh , are act ually a
lot harder t han t he [ pause] st udio − recording TI − digit s .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink , you know , one reason for t hat , uh , m ight be t hat
t here ’s st ill [ disfm arker] even t hough it ’s close − t alking , t here st ill is
som e noise and som e room acoust ics .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And anot her m ight be t hat , uh , I ’d [ disfm arker] I would
presum e t hat in t he st udio , uh , uh , sit uat ion recording read speech
t hat if som ebody
m e013 [ s] : did som et hing a lit t le funny or n pronounced som et hing a
lit t le funny or m ade a lit t le [ disfm arker] t hat t hey didn’t include it ,
m e011 [ qy ^ 2^ bu^ d^ rt ] : They didn’t include it .
m e013 [ s^ e] : t hey m ade t hem do it again .
m e011 [ s] : Whereas , I t ook out [ pause] t he ones t hat I not iced t hat
were blat ant [ disfm arker] t hat were correct able .
m e013 [ b.%] : Mm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So t hat , if som eone just read t he wrong digit , I correct ed
it .
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : And t hen t here was anot her one where Jose couldn’t
t ell whet her [ disfm arker] I couldn’t t ell whet her he was say ing zero or
six .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : And I asked him and he couldn’t t ell eit her .
m e026 [ b] : Hm m .
m e011 [ s] : So I just cut it out .
m e011 [ s] : You know , so I just e edit ed out t he first , i uh , word of
t he ut t erance .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Um , so t here ’s a lit t le bit of correct ion but it ’s definit ely
not as clean as TI − digit s .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : So m y expect at ions is TI − digit s would , especially
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bu] : I t hink TI − digit s is all [ pause] Am erican English .
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e011 [ s] : So it would probably do even a lit t le bet t er st ill
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ e] : on t he SRI syst em ,
m e011 [ s^ bd^ cs] : but we could give it a t ry .
m n017 [ fg] : Well .

m n017 [ s] : But [ pause] rem em ber , we ’re using a t elephone
bandwidt h front − end here , uh , on t his , uh [ disfm arker] on t his SRI
sy st em ,
m n017 [ s] : so , [ v ocalsound] um , I was [ disfm arker] I t hought t hat
m ay be t hat ’s act ually a good t hing
m n017 [ s^ rt ] : because it [ disfm arker] it get s rid of som e of t he
[ disfm arker] uh , t he noises ,
m n017 [ s^ e] : um , you know , in t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker]
below and above t he [ disfm arker] um , t he , you know , speech

m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n017 [ fh] : and , um ,
m n017 [ s] : I suspect t hat t o get sort of t he last bit out of t hese higher

uh , were t rained on wider − band dat a .
m n017 [ s.%−] : And of course we can’t do t hat or [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qw^ rt ] : Wha − what ’s TI − digit s ?
m e011 [ s.%−] : I t hought t
m e013 [ s^ na|s^ aa] : It ’s wide − band , yeah .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s [ disfm arker] in [ disfm arker] in fact , we looked it up
m e011 [ s^ bk^ m ] : It is wide − band .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : and it was act ually t went y kilohert z sam pling .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh , t hat ’s right .
m e011 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I did look t hat up .
m n017 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ df^ no] : I couldn’t rem em ber whet her t hat was TI − digit s or

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : But [ disfm arker] but , I would [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s easy enough t o t ry ,
m n017 [ s.%−] : just run it on [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ df^ t 3] : So , Morgan , you ’re get t ing a lit t le breat h noise .
m e013 [ %−] : See w

m n017 [ s.%−] : one [ disfm arker] one issue [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ cs^ t 3] : You m ight wanna m ove t he m ike down a lit t le bit .

m n017 [ s^ e] : If y ou have only one ut t erance per speaker you m ight
act ually screw up on est im at ing t he [ disfm arker] t he warping , uh ,
fact or .
m n017 [ fh] : So , um [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : I st rongly suspect t hat t hey have m ore speakers t han we
do .
m n017 [ s^ bk|s^ nd] : Right . But it ’s not t he am ount of speakers ,
m e011 [ fh] : So , uh [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ e] : it ’s t he num it ’s t he am ount of dat a per speaker .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s] : Right . So we [ disfm arker] we could probably do an
ex t ract ion t hat was roughly equivalent .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ fh] : Um .
m n017 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : So , alt hough I [ disfm arker] I sort of know how t o run it ,
t here are a lit t le [ disfm arker] a f few det ails here and t here t hat I ’ll
have t o [ pause] dig out .

m n017 [ fg] : OK .
m n017 [ s.%−] : The key [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : So t h t he syst em act ually ext ract s t he speaker ID from t he
wav eform nam es .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s] : Right . I saw t hat .
m n017 [ s] : And t here ’s a [ disfm arker] t here ’s a script [ disfm arker]
and t hat is act ually all in one script .
m n017 [ s] : So t here ’s t his one script t hat parses waveform nam es
m n017 [ s] : and ext ract s t hings like t he , um , speaker , uh , ID
m n017 [ s^ e] : or som et hing t hat can st and in as a speaker ID .
m n017 [ s^ cs] : So , we m ight have t o m odify t hat script t o recognize
t he , um , speakers , [ vocalsound] um , in t he [ disfm arker] in t he , uh ,
um , [ vocalsound] TI − digit s [ pause] dat abase .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s.%−] : And t hat , uh [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ cs] : Or you can fake [ disfm arker] you can fake [ pause]
nam es for t hese waveform s t hat resem ble t he nam es t hat we use here
for t he [ disfm arker] for t he m eet ings .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ s.%−] : That would be t he , sort of [ disfm arker] probably t he
safest way t o do [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s.%−−] : I m ight have t o do t hat anyway t o [ disfm arker] t o do
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ df] : because we m ay have t o do an ext ract t o get t he
[ pause] am ount of dat a per speaker about right .
m n017 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e011 [ qy^ rt ] : The ot her t hing is , isn’t TI − digit s isolat ed digit s ?
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ qrr] : Or is t hat anot her one ?
m e011 [ s^ df] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I looked t hrough a bunch of t he digit s
t corp corpora ,
m e011 [ s^ df^ e] : and now t hey ’re all blurring .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : Cuz one of t hem was lit erally people reading a single digit .
m e011 [ s] : And t hen ot hers were connect ed digit s .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah . Most of TI − digit s is connect ed digit s , I t hink .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] I m ean , we had a Bellcore corpus t hat we
were using .
m e011 [ s] : Maybe it ’s t he Bell Gram .
m e013 [ s] : It was [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat
was isolat ed digit s .
m e011 [ s^ e] : Bell Digit s .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Alright .

m n017 [ s] : By t he way , I t hink we can im prove t hese num bers if we
care t o com pr im prove t hem [ v ocalsound] by , um , [ vocalsound] not
st art ing wit h t he Swit chboard m odels but by t aking t he Swit chboard
m odels and doing supervised adapt at ion on a sm all am ount of digit
dat a collect ed in t his set t ing .
m e013 [ fh.%] : Um .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m n017 [ s^ df] : Because t hat would adapt your m odels t o t he room
acoust ics
m n017 [ s^ df^ e] : and f for t he far − field m icrophones , you know , t o
t he noise .
m n017 [ s] : And t hat should really im prove t hings , um , furt her .
m n017 [ s] : And t hen you use t hose adapt ed m odels , which are not
speaker adapt ed but sort of acous you know , channel adapt ed
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Channel adapt ed .
m n017 [ s] : use t hat as t he st art ing m odels for your speaker
adapt at ion .
m e013 [ fg|s^ ng] : Yeah . [ vocalsound] But t he t hing is , uh
[ disfm arker] I m ean , w when you [ disfm arker] it depends whet her you
’re ju were just using t his as a [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] a st art er t ask
for [ disfm arker] you know , t o get t hings going for conversat ional or if
we ’re really int erest ed i in connect ed digit s .
m e013 [ s] : And I [ disfm arker] I t hink t he answer is bot h .
m n017 [ s^ ng^ no] : Well , I don’t know .
m e013 [ s] : And for [ disfm arker] for connect ed digit s over t he
t elephone y ou don’t act ually want t o put a whole lot of effort int o
adapt at ion
m e013 [ s^ df] : because [ vocalsound] som ebody [ pause] get s on t he

m e013 [ s^ df^ e] : and t hen you just want it .
m e013 [ s.%−] : You don’t [ disfm arker] don’t , uh [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : This is [ disfm arker] t his [ disfm arker] t hat one ’s bet t er .
m n017 [ b] : Right .

m n017 [ s] : Um , but , you know , I [ disfm arker] uh , m y im pression was
t hat y ou were act ually int erest ed in t he far − field m icrophone , uh ,

m n017 [ %−−] : I m ean .

m n017 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?

m n017 [ s^ df.%−−] : Then , eh [ disfm arker] because you [ disfm arker]
y ou don’t hav e any [ disfm arker]

m n017 [ s] : That ’s where t he m ost m acoust ic m ism at ch is bet ween
t he current ly used m odels and t he [ disfm arker] t he r t he set up here .

m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−] : I m ean , I [ disfm arker] I guess I ’m saying I don’t know if
we ’d want t o do t hat as t he [ disfm arker] as [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ t 3] : Ot her way .

m e011 [ %−] : Liz [ disfm arker]

fe016 [ s.%] : You ’re all wat ching .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : This is t errible .
fe008 [ s^ df] : It ’s just we [ disfm arker] we t hink it has som e spikes .
fe008 [ s] : So , uh , we [ disfm arker] we didn’t use t hat one .
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : I ’ll get it .
fe008 [ s] : But y ou could if you want .
m e013 [ fg|s^ t .%−] : Yeah . At any rat e , I don’t know if w
fe008 [ s^ no.%] : I don’t know .
fe008 [ s] : And Andre − Andreas , your [ disfm arker] your m icrophone ’s
a lit t le bit low .
m n017 [ qh^ bk.%] : It is ?
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−] : I don’t know if we wanna use t hat as t he [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fh.%] : Uh .
m e011 [ s] : Uh , it pivot s .
fe008 [ s^ cs.%−−] : So if you see t he pict ure
m n017 [ %−] : I I [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ cs] : It [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] like t his .
fe008 [ s^ cs.%−] : and t hen you have t o scr
m n017 [ s^ df] : I [ disfm arker] I already adjust ed t his a num ber of t im es
.
m e011 [ fh.%] : Eh .

m n017 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker] I
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah , I t hink t hese m ikes are not working as well as I
would like .
m n017 [ s.%−] : can’t quit e seem t o [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , I t hink t his cont rapt ion around your head
is not [ pause] working so well .
m e013 [ s^ na|s^ aa] : Too m any adju t oo m any adjust m ent s . Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : Anyway , what I was saying is t hat I [ disfm arker] I
t hink I probably wouldn’t want t o see t hat as sort of like t he norm ,
t hat we com pared all t hings t o .
fe008 [ s^ t 3.%] : That looks good .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : To , uh , t he [ disfm arker] t o have [ disfm arker] have all
t his ad all t his , uh , adapt at ion .
m e013 [ s^ df.%−] : But I t hink it ’s an im port ant dat a point , if you ’re
[ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : Um .
m e013 [ s] : The ot her t hing t hat [ disfm arker] t hat , uh [ disfm arker] of
course , what Barry was looking at was [ disfm arker] was just t hat ,
m e013 [ s] : t he near versus far .
m e013 [ s] : And , yeah , t he adapt at ion would get [ vocalsound] t h
som e of t hat .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : But , I t hink even [ disfm arker] even if t here was , uh , only
a fact or of t wo or som et hing , like I was saying in t he em ail , I t hink t hat
’s [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t hat ’s a big fact or .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Liz , y ou could also just use t he ot her m ike if you ’re having

m e013 [ %−] : N
fe008 [ fg] : Well .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ fg|s^ ba] : Yeah . This would be OK .
fe008 [ s] : We [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] we t hink t hat t his has
spikes on it ,
fe016 [ s] : It ’s t his t hing ’s [ disfm arker] This is t oo big for m y head .
fe008 [ s] : so it ’s not as good acoust ically ,
m n017 [ fg|s] : Yeah , basically y our ears are t oo big .
fe008 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ bd] : I m ean , m ine are t oo .
m n017 [ s^ bd^ e] : E t h everybody ’s ears are t oo big for t hese t hings .
fe016 [ s^ ar|s] : No , m y [ disfm arker] m y [ disfm arker] But t his is t oo big
for m y head .

m n017 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : So , I m ean , [ com m ent ] [ com m ent ] it doesn’t
[ disfm arker] you know , it ’s sit
fe008 [ s^ cs.%−−] : Well , if you ’d rat her have t his one t hen it ’s
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Oh , well .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : It ’s [ pause] great .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : So t he [ disfm arker] To get t hat , uh , pivot ed t his way ,
it pivot s like t his .
fe016 [ s] : No t his way .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : There you go .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : And t here ’s a screw t hat you can t ight en .
m e011 [ s.%−−] : And t hen it [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe016 [ s] : I already [ pause] t ried t o get it close .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Good .
m e011 [ s] : So if it doesn’t bounce around t oo m uch , t hat ’s act ually
good placem ent .
fe008 [ s] : That looks good .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : But it looks like it ’s gonna bounce a lot .
m e013 [ qw^ t ^ t c] : So , where were we ?
m e013 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Digit s .
m e011 [ s^ e] : Adapt at ion .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , adapt at ion , non − adapt at ion ,
m e013 [ s] : um , fact or of t wo ,
m e013 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ qw^ rt .%−] : What k u By t he way , wh what fact or of t wo did you
[ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ fg|s] : Oh , yeah . I know what I was go w
m n017 [ %−−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , no , no .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s t ha t hat [ disfm arker] t hat we were saying , you know ,
well is [ disfm arker] how m uch worse is far t han near , you know .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh , t h OK .
m e013 [ s] : And I m ean it depends on which one you ’re looking at ,
m n017 [ s] : That fact or of t wo .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ s:s] : but for t he everybody , it ’s [ vocalsound] lit t le under a
fact or or t wo .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah . I [ disfm arker] I know what I was t hinking was t hat
m ay be , uh , i i we could act ually t t t ry at least looking at , uh , som e
of t he [ disfm arker] t he large vocabulary speech from a far m icrophone
,
m e013 [ s^ e] : at least from t he good one .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , before I t hought we ’d get , you know , a hundred
and fift y percent error or som et hing ,
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−] : but if [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] if , uh [ disfm arker] if we
’re get t ing t hirt y − fiv e , fort y percent or som et hing , [ vocalsound] u um
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : Act ually if you run , t hough , on a close − t alking m ike over
t he whole m eet ing , during all t hose silences , you get , like , four
hundred percent word error .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Right . I underst and .
m e013 [ s^ df.%−] : But doing t he sam e kind of lim it ed t hing [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ e] : Or [ disfm arker] or som e high num ber .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , sure .
m e013 [ s^ na] : Get all t hese insert ions .
m e013 [ s^ cs^ df.%−] : But I ’m saying if you do t he sam e kind of lim it ed
t hing [ v ocalsound] as people have done in Swit chboard evaluat ions or
as [ disfm arker] a
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Where you know who t he speaker is and t here ’s
no overlap ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ e^ rt ] : And you do just t he far − field for t hose
regions ?
m e013 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . The sam e sort of num bers t hat we got
t hose graphs from .
m e011 [ s^ bu] : Could we do exact ly t he sam e t hing t hat we ’re doing
now , but do it wit h a far − field m ike ?
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g] : Right ?
m e013 [ s^ aa|s.%−] : Yeah , do it wit h one of [ disfm arker] on
m e011 [ s^ df] : Cuz we ext ract t he t im es from t he near − field m ike ,
m e011 [ s] : but y ou use t he acoust ics from t he far − field m ike .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Right . I underst and t hat .
fe016 [ s] : I just m eant t hat [ disfm arker] so you have [ pause] t hree
choices .
fe016 [ s] : There ’s , um [ disfm arker] You can use t im es where t hat
person is t alking only from t he t ranscript s but t he segm ent at ions were
[ disfm arker] were sy nchronized .

fe016 [ s] : Or you can do a forced alignm ent on t he close − t alking t o
det erm ine t hat , t he you know , wit hin t his segm ent , t hese really were
t he t im es t hat t his person was t alking
fe016 [ s] : and elsewhere in t he segm ent ot her people are overlapping
fe016 [ s] : and just front − end t hose pieces .
fe016 [ s] : Or you can run it on t he whole dat a ,
fe016 [ s.%−] : which is [ disfm arker] which is , you know , a [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw] : But [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] but how did we get t he
[ disfm arker] how did we det erm ine t he links , uh , t hat we ’re t est ing
on in t he st uff we report ed ?
fe016 [ s] : In t he H L T paper we t ook [ pause] segm ent s t hat are
channel [ disfm arker] t im e − aligned ,
fe016 [ s] : which is now h being changed in t he t ranscript ion process ,
fe016 [ s] : which is good ,
fe016 [ s:s] : and we t ook cases where t he t ranscribers said t here was
only one person t alking here ,
fe016 [ s^ df] : because no one else had t im e [ disfm arker] any words in
t hat segm ent
fe016 [ s:s] : and called t hat " non − ov erlap " .
m e013 [ %−] : And t ha
m e013 [ s^ bu] : And t hat ’s what we were get t ing t hose num bers from .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ e] : Tho − good [ disfm arker] t he good num bers .
fe016 [ s] : The bad num bers were from [ pause] t he segm ent s where
t here was ov erlap .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Well , we could st art wit h t he good ones .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : But anyway [ disfm arker] so I t hink t hat we should t ry it
once wit h [ vocalsound] t he sam e condit ions t hat were used t o creat e
t hose ,
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs^ e] : and in t hose sam e segm ent s just use one of t he P
Z
fe016 [ s^ bk|s] : Right . So we [ disfm arker] we can do t hat .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t hen , you know , I m ean , t he t hing is if we were
get t ing , uh [ disfm arker] what , t hirt y − five , fort y percent , som et hing
like t hat on [ disfm arker] on t hat part icular set ,
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qh] : uh , does it go t o sev ent y or eight y ?
m e013 [ qh] : Or , does it use up so m uch m em ory we can’t decode it ?
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : It m ight also depend on which speaker t h it is and how
close t hey are t o t he PZM ?
m e013 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ no] : I don’t know how different t hey are from each ot her .

m n017 [ s^ cs] : You want t o probably choose t he PZM channel t hat is
closest t o t he speaker .
fe016 [ s.%−] : To be best [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : For t his part icular digit ones , I just picked t hat one .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ %−] : f
m e013 [ %−] : Well [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
fe016 [ s^ bu] : So we would t hen use t hat one , t oo ,
m e011 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : This is kind of cent ral .
fe016 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s] : You know , it ’s [ disfm arker] so i but I would [ disfm arker] I
’d pick t hat one .
m e013 [ s] : It ’ll be less good for som e people t han for ot her ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : but I [ disfm arker] I ’d like t o see it on t he sam e
[ disfm arker] exact sam e dat a set t hat [ disfm arker] t hat we did t he
ot her t hing on .
m e011 [ %−] : Act ually [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : I sh act ually should ’ve picked a different one ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e011 [ s^ df] : because [ pause] t hat could be why t he PDA is worse .
m e011 [ s^ df] : Because it ’s furt her away from m ost of t he people
reading digit s .
m n014 [ s^ 2^ na|s^ aa] : It ’s furt her away . Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ na] : That ’s probably one of t he reasons .
fe008 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ fg|s^ cs] : Well , yeah . You could look at , I guess , t hat PZM or
som et hing .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ s^ df^ ng] : But t he ot her is , it ’s v ery , uh [ disfm arker] I m ean ,
ev en t hough t here ’s [ disfm arker] I ’m sure t he f f t he [ disfm arker] t he
SRI , uh , front − end has som e kind of pre − em phasis , it ’s [ disfm arker]
it ’s , uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] st ill , t h it ’s picking up lot s of low −
frequency energy .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : So , ev en discrim inat ing against it , I ’m sure som e of it ’s
get t ing t hrough .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ s^ na] : But , yeah , you ’re right .
m e013 [ s^ na] : Prob − a part of it is just t he dist ance .
fe016 [ qy ^ rt ] : And aren’t t hese pret t y bad m icrophones ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .

fe016 [ %−−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aap] : Well , t hey ’re bad .
m e013 [ s^ df^ ng] : But , I m ean , if you list en t o it , it sounds OK . You
know ?
m e011 [ fg|s] : Yeah . When you list en t o it , uh , t he PZM and t he PDA
[ disfm arker] Yeah , t h t he PDA has higher sound floor
m e013 [ b.%] : u Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : but not by a lot .
m e011 [ s^ e] : It ’s really pret t y [ disfm arker] uh , pret t y m uch t he sam e
.
fe016 [ s] : I just rem em ber you saying you got t hem t o be cheap on
purpose .
fe016 [ s^ e] : Cheap in t erm s of t heir qualit y .
fe016 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s] : Well , t hey ’re [ pause] t went y − five cent s or so .
m e011 [ s] : Th − we want ed t hem t o be [ disfm arker] t o be t ypical of
what would be in a PDA .
m e013 [ b.x] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So t hey are [ disfm arker] t hey ’re not t he PZM t hree
hundred dollar t ype .
fe016 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : They ’re t he t went y − five cent ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : buy t hem in packs of t housand t ype .
m e013 [ s] : But , I m ean , t he t hing is people use t hose lit t le m ikes for
ev ery t hing
fe016 [ s^ bk.%] : I see .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Everyt hing .
m e013 [ s^ df] : because t hey ’re really not bad .
m e013 [ s^ j] : I m ean , if you ’re not [ vocalsound] doing som et hing
ridiculous like feeding it t o a speech recognizer , t hey [ disfm arker] t hey
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] t hey [ disfm arker] you know , you can hear
t he sou hear t he sounds just fine .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : You know , it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : They [ disfm arker] I m ean , i it ’s m ore or less t he sam e
principles as t hese ot her m ikes are built under ,
m e013 [ s] : it ’s just t hat [ pause] t here ’s less qualit y cont rol .
m e013 [ s] : They just , you know , churn t hem out and don’t check
t hem .
m e013 [ fh] : Um . So .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : So t hat was [ disfm arker] Yeah . So t hat was i
int erest ing result .
m e013 [ s] : So like I said , t he front − end guys are very m uch
int erest ed in [ disfm arker] in t his is as [ disfm arker] as well

m e013 [ %−] : and
m n017 [ qw] : So [ disfm arker] so , but where is t his now ?
m n017 [ qw^ e] : I m ean , what ’s [ disfm arker] where do we go from
here ?
m n017 [ %−−] : I m ean ,
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . That was gonna be m y quest ion .
m n017 [ s] : we [ disfm arker] so we have a [ disfm arker] we have a
[ disfm arker] a sy st em t hat works pret t y well
m n017 [ s] : but it ’s not , you know , t he syst em t hat people here are
used t o using [ disfm arker] t o working wit h .
m n017 [ qw] : So what [ disfm arker] what do we do now ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Well , I t hink what we wanna do is we want t o
[ disfm arker] eh ,
m e013 [ s] : and we ’ve t alked about t his in ot her [ pause] cont ext s
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : we want t o [ vocalsound] have t he abilit y t o feed it different
feat ures .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen , um , [ vocalsound] from t he point of view of t he
front − end research , it would be s uh , subst it ut ing for HTK .
m n017 [ b] : OK .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : I t hink t hat ’s t he key t hing .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen if we can feed it different feat ures , t hen we can
t ry all t he different t hings t hat we ’re t rying t here .
m n017 [ b] : OK . Alright .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen , um , uh , also Dave is [ disfm arker] is t hinking
about using t he dat a in different ways , uh , t o [ vocalsound] um , uh ,
ex plicit ly work on rev erberat ion
m n017 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ e] : st art ing wit h som e t echniques t hat som e ot her people
have [ pause] found som ewhat useful , and [ disfm arker] Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n017 [ s^ bu] : So [ disfm arker] so t he key [ pause] t hing t hat ’s
m issing here is basically t he abilit y t o feed , you know , ot her feat ures
[ v ocalsound] i int o t he recognizer
m n017 [ s^ bu^ e] : and also t hen t o t rain t he syst em .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n017 [ s^ no] : And , uh , es I don’t know when Chuck will be back
m n017 [ s.%−] : but t hat ’s exact ly what he [ disfm arker] he ’s gonna
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−] : H h
m e013 [ s] : He ’s [ disfm arker] he ’s sort of back ,

m e013 [ s] : but he drove for fourt een hours an and wasn’t gonna
m ake it in t oday .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n017 [ fg|s] : So , I t hink t hat ’s one of t he t hings t hat he said he
would be working on .
m n017 [ fh] : Um .
m n017 [ s] : Just sort of t t o m ake sure t hat [ pause] we can do t hat
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] Um .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n017 [ s] : It ’s [ disfm arker] uh , I m ean , t he [ disfm arker] t he front −
end is f i t ha t hat ’s in t he SRI recognizer is very nice in t hat it does a
lot of t hings on t he fly
m n017 [ s^ df] : but it unfort unat ely [ pause] is not [ pause] designed
and , um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] like t he , uh , ICSI syst em is , where
y ou can feed it from a pipeline of [ disfm arker] of t he com m and .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : So , t he [ disfm arker] what t hat m eans probably for t he
foreseeable fut ure is t hat you have t o , uh , dum p out , um
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : you know , if you want t o use som e new feat ures , you
have t o dum p t hem int o individual files
m n017 [ s] : and [ pause] give t hose files t o t he recognizer .
m e011 [ s] : We do [ disfm arker] we t end t o do t hat any way .
m n017 [ s^ bk^ rt ] : OK .
m e011 [ fh] : Oh .
m e011 [ s] : So , alt hough you [ disfm arker] you can pipe it as well , we
t end t o do it t hat way
m e011 [ s^ df] : because t hat way you can concent rat e on one block
and not keep re − doing it over and over .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Alright .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg|%−] : Yeah . So I ’ve [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : So t ha t hat ’s exact ly what t he P − file [ pause] is for .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n017 [ fg|s] : Yeah , t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he
cum bersom e t hing is [ disfm arker] is , um [ disfm arker] is t hat you
act ually hav e t o dum p out lit t le [ disfm arker] lit t le files .
fe016 [ b] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : So for each segm ent t hat you want t o recognize
[ v ocalsound] you have t o [ pause] dum p out [ pause] a separat e file .
m e011 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n017 [ s] : Just like i t h like t h as if t here were t hese waveform
segm ent s ,
m n017 [ s] : but inst ead you have sort of feat ure file segm ent s .

m n017 [ s.%−−] : But , you know [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Cool .
m e013 [ fg|qo^ d^ e] : OK . So t he s t he [ disfm arker] t he next t hing we
had on t he agenda was som et hing about alignm ent s ?
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
fe016 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : Yes , we have [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bd^ no] : I don’t know ,
fe016 [ qy ^ cs^ rt ] : did you wanna t alk about it ,
fe016 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
fe016 [ s] : I can give a [ disfm arker] I was just t elling t his t o Jane
fe016 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] W we [ disfm arker] we
were able t o get som e definit e im provem ent on t he forced alignm ent s
by looking at t hem first and t hen realizing t he kinds of errors [ pause]
t hat were occurring
fe016 [ fh] : and um ,
fe016 [ s] : som e of t he errors occurring very frequent ly are just t hings
like t he first word being m oved t o as early as possible in t he
recognit ion ,
fe016 [ s] : which is a um , I t hink was bot h a [ disfm arker] a pruning
[ pause] problem
fe016 [ s] : and possibly a problem wit h needing const raint s on word
locat ions .
fe016 [ s] : And so we t ried bot h of t hese st t hings .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : We t ried saying [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bk^ no] : I don’t know ,
fe016 [ s] : I got t his [ vocalsound] whacky idea t hat [ disfm arker] just
from looking at t he dat a , t hat when people t alk [ pause] t heir words
are usually chunked t oget her .
fe016 [ s] : It ’s not t hat t hey say one word and t hen t here ’s a bunch
of words t oget her .
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : They ’re [ com m ent ] m ight say one word and t hen
anot her word far away if t hey were doing just backchannels ?
fe016 [ s] : But in general , if t here ’s , like , five or six words and one
word ’s far away from it , t hat ’s probably wrong on average .
fe016 [ fh] : So , um [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : And t hen also , ca t he pruning , of course , was t oo
[ disfm arker] t oo sev ere .
m n017 [ s^ ba] : So t hat ’s act ually int erest ing .
m n017 [ s] : The pruning was t he sam e value t hat we used for
recognit ion .
m n017 [ s] : And we had lowered t hat [ disfm arker] we had used t ight er
pruning aft er Liz ran som e experim ent s showing t hat , you know , it
runs slower
m n017 [ s.%−] : and t here ’s no real difference in [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ 2] : No gain .

fe016 [ s^ ng.%−−] : Act ually it was bet t er wit h [ disfm arker] slight ly
bet t er or about t h
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ e^ ng] : it was t he sam e wit h t ight er pruning .
m n017 [ s] : So for free recognit ion , t his [ disfm arker] t he lower pruning
v alue is bet t er .
m n017 [ %−] : You [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : It ’s probably cuz t he recognit ion ’s just bad en at a point
where it ’s bad enough t hat [ disfm arker] t hat you don’t lose anyt hing .
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Correct .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ fg|s] : Um , but it t urned out for [ disfm arker] for [ disfm arker] t o
get accurat e alignm ent s it was really im port ant t o open up t he pruning
significant ly .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
m n017 [ fh|s^ df] : Um [ pause] because ot herwise it would sort of do
greedy alignm ent , um , in regions where t here was no real speech yet
from t he foreground speaker .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s] : Um , [ v ocalsound] so t hat was one big fact or t hat helped
im prove t hings
m n017 [ s.%−−] : and t hen t he ot her t hing was t hat ,
m n017 [ s] : y ou know , as Liz said t he [ disfm arker] we f enforce t he
fact t hat , uh , t he foreground speech has t o be cont inuous .
m n017 [ s^ e] : It cannot be [ disfm arker] you cannot have a
background speech hypot hesis in t he m iddle of t he foreground speech
.
m n017 [ s^ e] : You can only have background speech at t he beginning
and t he end .
fe016 [ fg|s^ arp] : Yeah . I m ean , y eah , it isn’t always t rue ,
fe016 [ s^ cs] : and I t hink what we really want is som e clever way t o do
t his ,
fe016 [ s.%−−] : where , um , you know , from t he dat a or from m aybe
som e hand − correct ed alignm ent s from t ranscribers t hat
fe016 [ s.%−−] : t hings like words t hat do occur just by t hem selves
[ pause] a alone , like backchannels or som et hing t hat we did allow t o
have background speech around it [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : t hose would be able t o do t hat ,
fe008 [ s^ fa.%] : Sorry .
fe016 [ s] : but t he rest would be const rained .
fe016 [ s] : So , I t hink we have a version t hat ’s pret t y good for t he
nat iv e speakers .
fe016 [ s^ no] : I don’t know yet about t he non − nat ive speakers .
fe016 [ fh] : And , um ,

fe016 [ s] : we basically also m ade noise m odels for t he different
[ disfm arker] sort of grouped som e of t he [ pause] m out h noises
t oget her .
fe016 [ fh|s] : Um , so , and t hen t here ’s a background speech m odel .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : And we also [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : There was som e neat [ disfm arker] or , int erest ing cases ,
fe016 [ s] : like t here ’s one m eet ing where , [ vocalsound] um , Jose ’s
giv ing a present at ion
fe016 [ s:s] : and he ’s t alking about , um , t he word " m ixed [ pause]
signal "
fe016 [ s:s] : and som eone didn’t underst and , uh , t hat you were
say ing " m ix ed " [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : I t hink , Morgan .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah , y eah .
fe016 [ s:s] : And so your speech − ch was s saying som et hing about
m ix ed signal .
fe016 [ s] : And t he next t urn was a lot of people saying " m ixed " ,
fe016 [ s^ e:s] : like " he m eans m ixed signal " or " I t hink it ’s m ixed " .
fe016 [ s] : And t he word " m ixed " in t his segm ent occurs , like , a
bunch of t im es .
m n005 [ %−] : Sh
fe016 [ s] : And Chuck ’s on t he lapel here ,
fe016 [ s] : and he also says " m ixed "
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : but it ’s at t he last one ,
fe016 [ s:s] : and of course t he aligner t h aligns it everywhere else t o
ev ery body else ’s " m ixed " ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ df] : cuz t here ’s no adapt at ion yet .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : So t here ’s [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] I t hink t here ’s
som e issues about [ disfm arker] u
fe016 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : We probably want t o adapt at least t he foreground
speaker .
fe016 [ s] : But , I guess Andreas t ried adapt ing bot h t he foreground
and a background generic speaker ,
fe016 [ s^ ba] : and t hat ’s act ually a lit t le bit of a f funky m odel .
fe016 [ s] : Like , it gives you som e weird alignm ent s ,
fe016 [ s^ df] : just because oft en t he background speakers m at ch
bet t er t o t he foreground t han t he foreground speaker .
m n017 [ fg] : Oh [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Oh .
fe016 [ s] : So t here ’s som e t hings t here ,
fe016 [ s^ df^ e] : especially when you get lot s of t he sam e words , uh ,
occurring in t he [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fg|%−] : Well , t he [ disfm arker]

m n017 [ s.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink you can do bet t er by [ vocalsound]
uh , cloning [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : so we have a reject phone .
m n017 [ s] : And y ou [ disfm arker] and what we want ed t o t ry wit h
[ disfm arker] you know , once we have t his paper writ t en and have a
lit t le m ore t im e , [ v ocalsound] uh , t cloning t hat reject m odel
m n017 [ s] : and t hen one copy of it would be adapt ed t o t he
foreground speaker t o capt ure t he reject s in t he foreground ,
m n017 [ s^ e] : like fragm ent s and st uff ,
m n017 [ s] : and t he ot her copy would be adapt ed t o t he background
speaker .
fe016 [ fg|s.%−] : Right . I m ean , in general we act ually [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s:s] : Right now t he words like [ pause] part ial words are
[ pause] reject m odels
m n017 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : and y ou norm ally allow t hose t o m at ch t o any word .
fe016 [ s] : But t hen t he background speech was also a reject m odel ,
fe016 [ s] : and so t his const raint of not allowing reject s in bet ween
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : y ou know , it needs t o different iat e bet ween t he t wo .
fe016 [ s] : So just sort of working t hrough a bunch of debugging kinds
of issues .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s.%−−:s.%−−] : And anot her one is t urns , like people st art ing wit h
[ v ocalsound] " well I t hink "
fe016 [ s.%−−:qo.%−−] : and som eone else is [ pause] " well how about " .
fe016 [ s:s] : So t he word " well " is in t his [ disfm arker] in t his [ pause]
segm ent m ult iple t im es ,
fe016 [ s] : and as soon as it occurs usually t he aligner will t ry t o align
it t o t he first person who says it .
fe016 [ s] : But t hen t hat const raint of sort of [ disfm arker] uh ,
prox im it y const raint will push it over t o t he person who really said it in
general .
m e011 [ qy] : Is t he proxim it y const raint a hard const raint ,
m e011 [ qrr.%−−] : or did you do som e sort of probabilist ic weight ing
dist ance , or [ disfm arker] ?
m n017 [ s.%−] : We [ disfm arker] we didn’t [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ ar] : No .
fe016 [ s] : Right now it ’s a kluge .
m n017 [ %−] : We [ disfm arker] w
m n017 [ fg] : OK .
m n017 [ s^ rt ] : We [ disfm arker] it ’s st raight forward t o act ually just
have a [ disfm arker] a penalt y t hat doesn’t com plet ely disallows it but
discourages it .

m n017 [ s^ df] : But , um , we just didn’t have t im e t o play wit h , you
know , t uning yet anot her [ disfm arker] yet anot her param et er .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : The ve level .
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : And really t he reason we can’t do it is just t hat we don’t
have a [ disfm arker] we don’t have ground t rut h for t hese .
m n017 [ s^ cs] : So , [ vocalsound] we would need a hand − m arked , um
, [ v ocalsound] word − level alignm ent s
m n017 [ s^ cs^ e] : or at least sort of t he boundaries of t he speech
bet w y ou know , bet ween t he speakers .
m n017 [ fh|s] : Um , and t hen use t hat as a reference
m n017 [ s] : and t une t he param et ers of t he [ disfm arker] of t he m odel ,
uh , t o op t o get t he best [ pause] perform ance .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qw] : G given [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I m ean , I wa I wa I was
gonna ask y ou any way , uh , how you assessed t hat t hings were bet t er
.
m n017 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : I looked at t hem .
fe016 [ s] : I spent t wo days [ disfm arker] um , in Waves [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : Oh , it was painful
fe016 [ s^ df] : because [ vocalsound] t he t hing is , you know t he
alignm ent s share a lot in com m on ,
fe016 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : And you ’re [ disfm arker] y o you ’re looking at t hese
segm ent s where t here ’s a lot of speech .
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , a lot of t hem have a lot of words .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : Not by ev ery speaker
fe016 [ s] : but by som e speaker t here ’s a lot of words .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ %−] : Ju
fe016 [ s.%−−] : No , not [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ ba] : I m ean t hat if you look at t he individual segm ent s from
just one person you don’t see a lot of words ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ df] : but alt oget her y ou ’ll see a lot of words up t here .
fe016 [ s] : And so t he reject is also m apping and pauses [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : So I looked at t hem all in Waves
fe016 [ s] : and just lined up all t he alignm ent s ,
fe016 [ s] : and , at first it sort of looked like a m ess

fe016 [ s:s] : and t hen t he m ore I looked at it , I t hought " OK , well it ’s
m ov ing t hese words left ward
fe016 [ s^ ba] : and [ disfm arker] " You know , it wasn’t t hat bad .
fe016 [ s] : It was just doing cert ain t hings wrong .
fe016 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ df] : But , I don’t , you know , have t im e t o l [ com m ent ] t o
look at all of t hem
fe016 [ s^ cs] : and it would be really useful t o have , like , a
[ disfm arker] a t ranscriber who could use Waves ,
fe016 [ s^ cs^ e] : um , just m ark , like , t he beginning and end of t he
foreground speaker ’s real words [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ e] : like , t he beginning of t he first word , t he end of t he last
word [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : and t hen we could , you know , do som e adjust m ent s .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : I [ disfm arker] OK .
fe008 [ s] : I hav e t o ask you som et hing ,
fe008 [ s^ cs^ df] : is i does it hav e t o be Waves ? Because if we could
benefit from what y ou did , incorporat e t hat int o t he present
t ranscript s , [ com m ent ] t hat would help .
m n017 [ s^ ar] : No .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And t hen , um , t he ot her t hing is , I believe t hat I did
hand
fe008 [ s] : So . One of t hese t ranscript s was gone over by a
t ranscriber
fe008 [ s] : and t hen I hand − m arked it m yself so t hat we do have , uh ,
t he beginning and ending of individual ut t erances .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : Um , I didn’t do it word level ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : but [ disfm arker] but in t erm s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : So I [ disfm arker] so for [ disfm arker] for one of t he N S A
groups .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : And also I went back t o t he original one t hat I first
t ranscribed and [ disfm arker] and did it w uh , w uh , ut t erance by
ut t erance for t hat part icular one .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So I t hink you do have [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : if t hat ’s a sufficient unit , I t hink t hat you do have hand −
m arking for t hat .
fe008 [ s] : But it ’d be wonderful t o be able t o [ vocalsound] benefit
from y our Waves st uff .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s] : We don’t care what [ disfm arker] what t ool you use .
fe016 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah . I m ean , if [ disfm arker] if you can , um
[ disfm arker] if y ou wanna [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .

fe008 [ s] : I used it in Transcriber
m n017 [ %−] : U uh [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−] : and it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s in t he [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : well , Jane and I were [ disfm arker] just in t erm s of t he t ool ,
t alking about t his .
fe016 [ s] : I guess Sue had had som e [ pause] react ions .
fe016 [ s] : You know , int erface − wise if you ’re looking at speech , you
wanna be able t o know really where t he words are .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , t hat ’s right .
fe016 [ s] : And so , [ vocalsound] we can give you som e exam ples of
sort of what t his out put looks like ,
fe008 [ s.%−] : Middle of t he word , or [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ cs] : um , and see if you can in m aybe incorporat e it int o t he
Transcriber t ool som e way ,
fe016 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : Well , I t h I ’m t hinking just ch e e incorporat ing it int o t he
represent at ion .
fe016 [ fh] : Um .
fe008 [ s.%−] : I m ean , if it ’s [ disfm arker] if it ’s [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : You m ean like [ disfm arker] Yeah , word st art insight s .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : if you have st art point s , if you have , like , t im e t ags ,
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ rt ] : which is what I assum e .
fe008 [ qy .%−−] : Isn’t t hat what [ disfm arker] what you [ disfm arker] ?
fe008 [ s.%−] : Well , see , Adam would be [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fg|s] : Yeah , what ever you use .
m n017 [ s] : I m ean , we convert it t o t his form at t hat t he , um , NIST
scoring t ool unders uh , CTM . Conversat ion Tim e − Marked file .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s.%−] : And [ disfm arker] and t hen t hat ’s t he [ disfm arker] t hat
’s what t he [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : I t hink Transcriber , uh , out put s CTM .
fe008 [ %−] : If it [ disfm arker] ?
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ am ] : I t hink so .
fe008 [ s] : So you would know t his m ore t han I would .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s.%−] : So , I m ean [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : It seem s like she [ disfm arker] if she ’s g if she ’s m oving
t im e m arks around ,
fe008 [ s] : since our represent at ion in Transcriber uses t im e m arks , it
seem s like t here should be som e way of [ disfm arker] of using t hat
[ disfm arker] benefit t ing from t hat .
m e011 [ b] : Right .

fe016 [ fg|s] : Yeah , it wou t he advant age would just be t hat when you
brought up a bin y ou would be able [ disfm arker] if you were zoom ed in
enough in Transcriber t o see all t he words ,
m e013 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : you would be able t o , like , have t he words sort of locat ed
in t im e ,
fe016 [ s] : if y ou want ed t o do t hat .
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : So [ disfm arker] so if we e e even just had a
[ disfm arker] a [ disfm arker] It sounds like w we [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] we alm ost do .
fe016 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Uh , if we [ disfm arker] We have t wo .
fe008 [ s] : We have t wo .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Just ha uh , t rying out [ pause] t he alignm ent
[ v ocalsound] procedure t hat you have on t hat
fe016 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : y ou could act ually get som et hing , um [ disfm arker] uh , uh
, get an object ive m easure .
m n017 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bu.%−−] : You m ean on [ disfm arker] on t he hand − m arked ,
um [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : So we [ disfm arker] we only r hav I only looked at act ually
alignm ent s from one m eet ing t hat we chose ,
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ e] : I t hink MR four ,
fe016 [ s.%−−] : just random ly , um [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ nd] : Act ually , not random ly .
fe016 [ s^ m ^ na] : Not random ly [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ df] : We knew [ disfm arker] we knew t hat it had t hese
insert ion errors from [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : It had sort of [ pause] average recognit ion perform ance in a
bunch of speakers
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : and it was a Meet ing Recorder m eet ing .
fe016 [ fh] : Um .
fe016 [ s] : But , y eah , we should t ry t o use what you have .
fe016 [ s] : I did re − run recognit ion on your new version of MR one .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Oh , good .
fe016 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I m ean t he [ disfm arker] t he one wit h Dan
[ pause] Ellis in it [ v ocalsound] and Eric .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Good !
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh . Yeah , ex act ly . Yeah . Yeah .

m e001 [ s^ ng] : I don’t t hink t hat was t he new version .
fe016 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ %−−] : That [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , act ually it wasn’t t he new new ,
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe016 [ s] : it was t he m edium new .
fe016 [ s^ cs] : But [ disfm arker] but we would [ disfm arker] we should do
t he [ disfm arker] t he lat est version .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e001 [ qy^ rt ] : You [ disfm arker] did you adjust t he [ disfm arker] t he
ut t erance t im es , um , for each channel ?
fe016 [ s] : It was t he one from last week .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe008 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yes , I did .
fe008 [ s] : And furt herm ore , I found t hat t here were a cert ain num ber
where [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] not [ disfm arker] not a lot , but several
t im es I act ually [ v ocalsound] m oved an ut t erance from [ vocalsound]
Adam ’s channel t o Dan ’s or from Dan ’s t o Adam ’s .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So t here was som e speaker ident if
fe008 [ s] : And t he reason was because [ vocalsound] I t ranscribed
t hat at a point before [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] uh , before we had
t he m ult iple audio available
fe008 [ %−−] : f
fe008 [ s] : so I couldn’t swit ch bet ween t he audio .
fe008 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I t ranscribed it off of t he m ixed channel
ent irely ,
fe008 [ s] : which m eant in overlaps , I was at a [ disfm arker] at a t errific
disadvant age .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : In addit ion it was before t he channelized , uh , possibilit y
was t here .
fe008 [ s] : And finally I did it using t he speakers of m y , um [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] of [ disfm arker] you know , off t he CPU on m y [ disfm arker]
on m y m achine
fe008 [ s^ df] : cuz I didn’t have a headphone .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So it @ @ , like , I m ean [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : Yeah , I [ disfm arker] I m ean , i in ret rospect [ vocalsound] it
would ’v e been good t o ha [ vocalsound] have got I should ’ve got t en a
headphone .
fe008 [ s] : But in any case , um , t hi t his is [ disfm arker] t his was
t ranscribed in a [ disfm arker] in a , [ vocalsound] uh , less opt im al way
t han [ disfm arker] t han t he ones t hat cam e aft er it ,

fe008 [ s] : and I was able t o [ disfm arker] you know , an and t his m eant
t hat t here were som e speaker ident if ident ificat ions
m e001 [ s] : Well , I know t here were som e speaker labelling problem s ,
um , aft er int errupt ions .
fe008 [ s.%−] : which were changes .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : Fix ed t hat .
m e001 [ qy^ rt ] : Is t hat what y ou ’re referring t o ?
m e001 [ s^ rt ] : I m ean , cuz t here ’s t his one inst ance when , for
ex am ple , you ’re running down t he st airs .
fe008 [ s.%−] : Oh , well [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s] : I rem em ber t his m eet ing really well .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e001 [ b.%] : Right .
fe016 [ s] : Don [ disfm arker] Don has had [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] He
knows [ disfm arker] he can just read it like a play .
m e001 [ s.%−] : It ’s a [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , I ’ve [ disfm arker] I ’ve [ disfm arker] I ’m

m e001 [ s^ aa|s.%−] : Yeah , I can s
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s:s] : " And t hen she said , and t hen he said . "
m e001 [ fg|s] : Yeah , I know it by heart .
m e001 [ s^ rt ] : So , um , [ vocalsound] t here ’s one point when you ’re
running down t he st airs .
fe008 [ s^ fe] : Uh − oh .
m e001 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
m e001 [ s] : And , like , t here ’s an int errupt ion .
m e001 [ s] : You int errupt som ebody ,
m e001 [ s] : but t hen t here ’s no line aft er t hat .
m e001 [ s] : For exam ple , t here ’s no speaker ident ificat ion aft er t hat
line .
fe008 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e001 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t hat what you ’re t alking about ?
m e001 [ qrr] : Or were t here m islabellings as far as , like , t he a Adam
was [ disfm arker] ?
fe008 [ s] : That was fixed , um , before [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : i i i I t hink I I t hink I underst ood t hat pret t y [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ fg|s^ df] : Yeah . Cuz I t hought I let you know about t hat .
fe008 [ s^ ft ] : Thank y ou for m ent ioning .
m e001 [ s^ fw] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : Yeah , no , t ha t hat [ disfm arker] That I t hink went away a
couple of v ersions ago ,
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e001 [ s] : But y ou ’re act ually saying t hat cert ain , uh , speakers
were m is m is − ident ified .

fe008 [ s] : but it ’s good t o know .
fe008 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah . So , wit h [ disfm arker] under [ disfm arker] um ,
uh , list ening t o t he m ixed channel , t here were t im es when , as
surprising as t hat is , I got Adam ’s v oice confused wit h Dan ’s and vice
v ersa [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ bd^ df] : not for long ut t erances ,
m e001 [ b] : OK .
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bd^ e] : but jus just a couple of places ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : and em bedde em bedded in overlaps .
fe008 [ s] : The ot her t hing t hat was w int erest ing t o m e was t hat I
picked up a lot of , um , backchannels which were hidden in t he m ixed
signal ,
fe008 [ s] : which , y ou know , I m ean , y ou c not [ disfm arker] not t oo
surprising .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : But t he ot her t hing t hat [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I hadn’t t hought about t his ,
fe008 [ s] : but I t hou I want ed t o raise t his when you were [ disfm arker]
uh , wit h respect t o also a st rat egy which m ight help wit h t he
alignm ent s pot ent ially ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : but t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : When I was looking at t hese backchannels , t hey were
t urning up usually [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] very oft en in [ disfm arker]
w well , I won’t say " usually " [ disfm arker] but anyway , very oft en , I
picked t hem up in a channel [ vocalsound] w which was t he person who
had asked a quest ion .
fe008 [ s:qy ] : S so , like , som eone says " an and have you done t he so
− and − so ? "
fe008 [ s] : And t hen t here would be backchannels ,
fe008 [ s] : but it would be t he person who asked t he quest ion .
fe008 [ s] : Ot her people weren’t really doing m uch backchannelling .
fe008 [ s:s] : And , y ou know , som et im es y ou have t he [ disfm arker]
Yeah , uh − huh .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : Well , t hat ’s int erest ing .
fe008 [ s^ bd] : I m ean , i it wouldn’t be perfect ,
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ df] : but [ disfm arker] but it does seem m ore nat ural t o give a
backchannel when [ disfm arker] when y ou ’re som ehow involved in t he
t opic ,
fe016 [ s^ ar|s^ ba] : No , t hat ’s really int erest ing .
fe008 [ s] : and t he m ost nat ural way is for you t o have init iat ed t he
t opic by asking a quest ion .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n017 [ fg] : Well ,
m n017 [ s.%−−] : I t hink [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ ba] : That ’s int erest ing .
m n017 [ s^ ar|s] : No . I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] act ually I t hink what ’s
going on is backchannelling is som et hing t hat happens in t wo − part y
conv ersat ions .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s^ e] : And if you ask som eone a quest ion , you essent ially
init iat ing a lit t le t wo − part y conv ersat ion .
fe008 [ b.%] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : Well , act u Yeah , when we looked at t his [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : So t hen you ’re [ disfm arker] so and t hen you ’re expect ed
t o backchannel
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Ex act ly .
m n017 [ s^ df] : because t he person is addressing you direct ly and not
ev ery body .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Ex act ly .
fe008 [ s] : Exact ly m y point .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : An − and so t his is t he expect at ion t hing t hat
[ disfm arker] uh , uh ,
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : just t he dyadic [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−] : But in addit ion , y ou know , if som eone has done t his
analy sis him self and isn’t involved in t he dyad , but t hey m ight also give
backchannels t o v erify what [ disfm arker] what t he answer is t hat t his
[ disfm arker] t hat t he [ disfm arker] t he answerer ’s given [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−] : H
m e013 [ s:s] : I t ell you , I say [ disfm arker] I say " uh − huh " a lot ,
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ %−] : It ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : There y ou go .
fe016 [ s] : Well , but it ’s int erest ing
fe016 [ s^ df.%−] : cuz , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ e] : while people are t alking t o each ot her .
fe008 [ s] : There you go .
fe016 [ s^ ng:s] : But t here are fewer [ disfm arker] I t hink t here are
fewer " uh − huhs " .
fe008 [ b.%] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , just from [ disfm arker] We were looking at word
frequency list s t o t ry t o find t he cases t hat we would allow t o have t he
reject words in bet ween in doing t he alignm ent .

fe016 [ s] : You know t he ones we wouldn’t const rain t o be next t o t he
ot her words .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh , yeah .
fe016 [ s:s] : And " uh − huh " is not as frequent
fe016 [ s] : as it sort of would be in Swit chboard ,
fe016 [ s^ e] : if y ou looked at just a word frequency list of one − word
short ut t erances .
fe016 [ s:s] : And " yeah " is way up t here ,
fe016 [ s:s] : but not " uh − huh " .
fe016 [ s.%−−] : And so I was t hinking
fe016 [ s] : t hi it ’s not like [ pause] you ’re being encouraged by
ev ery body else t o keep [ pause] t alking in t he m eet ing .
fe016 [ s] : And uh , t hat ’s all , I I ’ll st op t here ,
fe016 [ s^ df] : cuz I I t hink what you say m akes a lot of sense .
fe008 [ s^ na] : Well , t hat ’s right .
fe008 [ s.%−] : And t hat would [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ %−] : Well , an
fe016 [ s.%−] : But it was sort of [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : And what you say is t he [ disfm arker] is t he re uh , o ot her
side of t his ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : which is t hat , you know , so t h t here are lot s of channels
where y ou don’t hav e t hese backchannels , w when a quest ion has
been asked
fe008 [ s.%−] : and [ disfm arker] and t hese [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s] : There ’s just probably less backchannelling in general ,
fe008 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : So t hat ’s good news , really .
fe016 [ s] : even if you consider every ot her person alt oget her one
person in t he m eet ing ,
fe016 [ s] : but we ’ll find out anyway .
fe016 [ s] : We were [ disfm arker] I guess t he ot her t hing we ’re
[ disfm arker] we ’re [ disfm arker] I should say is t hat we ’re gonna , um
t ry [ disfm arker] com pare t his t y pe of overlap analysis t o Swit chboard ,
m n017 [ s^ e] : And
fe016 [ s.%−] : where [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ m ^ na] : and CallHom e ,
fe016 [ qrr] : where we have bot h sides , so t hat we can t ry t o answer
t his quest ion of , y ou know , [ v ocalsound] is t here really m ore overlap
in m eet ings or is it just because we don’t have t he ot her channel in
Swit chboard
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : and we don’t know what people are doing .
fe016 [ s] : Try t o creat e a paper out of t hat .

m e013 [ fg|s^ df] : Yeah . I m ean , y y y ou folks have probably [ pause]
already t old m e ,
m e013 [ qy ] : but were [ disfm arker] were you int ending t o do a

m e013 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
fe016 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Um , you m ean t he one due t om orrow ?
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah . Well , we ’re st ill , like , writ ing t he script s for

fe016 [ s^ na] : and we will [ disfm arker] Yes , we ’re gonna t ry .
fe008 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : And I was t elling Don , do not [ pause] t ake t his as an

m e013 [ s:s] : Do as I say ,
m e001 [ s.%−] : That ’s r
fe016 [ fg|s] : So , [ com m ent ] we will t ry .
m e013 [ s:s] : don’t do as I do .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fg] : Well [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : It ’ll probably be a lit t le lat e ,
m e011 [ s] : It is different .
fe016 [ s] : but I ’m gonna t ry it .
m e011 [ s] : In previous years , Eurospeech only had t he abst ract due
by now ,
m e011 [ s] : not t he full paper .
m e001 [ b.%] : Right .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : And so all our t im ing was off .
m e011 [ s] : I ’ve given up on t ry ing t o do digit s .
m e011 [ s] : I just don’t t hink t hat what I have so far m akes a
Eurospeech paper .
fe016 [ s^ rt ] : Well , I ’m no We m ay be in t he sam e posit ion ,
fe016 [ s] : and I figured [ vocalsound] we ’ll t ry ,
fe016 [ s.%−−] : because t hat ’ll at least get us t o t he point where we
have [ disfm arker] We have t his really nice dat abase form at t hat
Andreas and I were working out t hat [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : It [ disfm arker] it ’s not very fancy .
fe016 [ s] : It ’s just a ASCII line by line form at ,
fe016 [ s] : but it does give you inform at ion [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : It ’s t he [ disfm arker] it ’s t he spurt form at .
fe016 [ s:s] : It [ disfm arker] Yeah , we ’re calling t hese " spurt s " aft er
Chafe .
fe016 [ s^ df] : I was t rying t o find what ’s a word for [ pause] a

fe008 [ b.%] : Hm m .

m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah . I know t hat t h t he Telecom people use
[ disfm arker] use " spurt " for t hat .
fe008 [ b] : Good .
fe016 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : They do ?
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Oh !
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e013 [ s] : And t hat ’s [ disfm arker] I m ean , I [ disfm arker] I was using
t hat for a while when I was doing t he rat e of speech st uff ,
fe016 [ s.%−] : I would jus
m e013 [ s^ df.%−−:s.%−−] : because I [ disfm arker] because I looked up in
som e books and I found [ disfm arker] OK , I wanna find a spurt
[ v ocalsound] in which [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bk] : Ah , right !
fe016 [ s] : It ’s just , like , defined by t he acoust ics .
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] an because [ disfm arker] cuz it ’s anot her

m e011 [ s^ ba] : Horrible .
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ qo] : But how fast do t hey do [ pause] t he words wit hin t he
spurt ?
fe016 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e001 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : you know " Burst " also ?
m e011 [ s.%−] : It ’s gonna [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : Well , t hat ’s what we were calling spurt ,
m e011 [ s] : Burst .
m e001 [ qy ^ rt ] : Isn’t " burst " is used also ?
fe016 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Spurt has t he horrible nam e overloading wit h ot her
[ disfm arker] wit h hardware at ICSI .
m e013 [ s^ 2] : Here .
m e013 [ s^ na|s^ aa] : Just very locally , yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−] : But [ disfm arker] but t hat just [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : Well , well , Chafe had t his wor I t hink it was Chafe , or
som ebody had a [ disfm arker] t he word " spurt " originally ,
m n005 [ %] : Here @ @ [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s.%−−] : and so I [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ %−] : Act ually [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ ba] : But t ha t hat ’s good t o know .
fe016 [ qy ] : Was t hi it ’s Chafe ?
m n017 [ s^ cs.%−] : So m aybe we should t alk [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : Well , see , I know S Sue wrot e about spurt s of developm ent
.
fe016 [ s.%−] : Maybe it was Sue [ disfm arker] ?

fe008 [ s^ ba^ rt ] : But , in any case , I t hink it ’s a good t erm ,
fe016 [ %−] : Y
m e011 [ b] : Hm m !
fe008 [ fh] : and , uh [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : So we have spurt s and we hav e spurt − ify dot shell and
spurt − ify
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : And m a m aybe [ disfm arker] m aybe Chafe did .
m n017 [ fh] : Uh .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ %−] : So s
fe008 [ s.%−] : I know [ disfm arker] I know Ch − Chafe dealt wit h
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : And t hen it ’s got all [ disfm arker] it ’s a verb now .
m e001 [ s^ ba] : That ’s cool .
m n017 [ %−] : W uh , w
fe008 [ s] : Chafe speaks about int onat ion unit s .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yes . Right .
fe008 [ s] : But m aybe he speaks about spurt s as well
m n017 [ %−] : We
fe008 [ s^ no] : and I just don’t know .
fe008 [ s^ co] : Yeah , go ahead .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : So what we ’re doing [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s:s] : I ’ve heard " burst " also .
m n017 [ s^ bd^ df] : uh , t his [ disfm arker] t his is just [ disfm arker]
m ay be som eone has s som e [ disfm arker] som e ideas about how t o do
it bet t er ,
m e001 [ b] : Mm m .
m n017 [ s] : but we [ disfm arker] So we ’re t aking t hese , uh ,
alignm ent s from t he individual channels .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : We ’re [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : from each alignm ent we ’re producing , uh , one of t hese
CTM files ,
m n017 [ s] : which essent ially has [ disfm arker] it ’s just a linear
sequence of words wit h t he begin t im es for every word and t he
durat ion .
fe008 [ b] : Great .
m n017 [ s.%−] : And [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and of course
[ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s|qy^ d^ f^ g] : It looks like a Wav es label file alm ost . Right ?
m n017 [ s^ aa|s] : Right . But it has [ disfm arker] one [ disfm arker] t he
first colum n has t he m eet ing nam e ,
fe016 [ s.%−] : It ’s just [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : so it could act ually cont ain sev eral m eet ings .
m n017 [ fh] : Um .
m n017 [ s] : And t he second colum n is t he channel .

m n017 [ s] : Third colum n is t he , um , st art t im es of t he words and t he
fourt h colum n is t he durat ion of t he words .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : And t hen we ’re ,
m n017 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fg|s] : OK . Then we have a m essy alignm ent process where we
act ually insert int o t he sequence of words t he , uh , t ags
m n017 [ s^ e] : for , like , where [ disfm arker] where sent ence
[ disfm arker] ends of sent ence ,
m n017 [ s^ e] : quest ion m arks ,
m n017 [ fh|s^ e] : um , [ vocalsound] various ot her t hings .
fe016 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah . These are t hings t hat we had Don [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fh] : Uh .
fe016 [ s] : So , Don sort of , um , propagat ed t he punct uat ion from t he
original t ranscriber [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s] : so whet her it was , like , quest ion m ark or period or ,
[ v ocalsound] um , you know , com m a and t hings like t hat ,
fe016 [ s] : and we kept t he [ disfm arker] and disfluency dashes
[ disfm arker] uh , kept t hose in because we sort of wanna know where
t hose are relat ive t o t he spurt overlaps [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so t hose are act ually sort of ret ro − fit t ed
int o t he t im e alignm ent .
fe016 [ s^ bsc] : sp overlaps ,
fe016 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : And t hen we m erge all t he alignm ent s from t he various
channels
m n017 [ s] : and we sort t hem by t im e .
m n017 [ s] : And t hen t here ’s a [ disfm arker] t hen t here ’s a process
where y ou now det erm ine t he spurt s .
m n017 [ s] : That is [ disfm arker] Act ually , no , you do t hat before you
m erge t he various channels .
m n017 [ s] : So y ou [ disfm arker] y ou id ident ify by som e crit erion ,
m n017 [ s] : which is pause lengt h [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : y ou ident ify t he beginnings and ends of t hese spurt s ,
m n017 [ s] : and y ou put anot her set of t ags in t here t o keep t hose
st raight .
m e013 [ b.%] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s] : And t hen you m erge everyt hing in t erm s of , you know ,
linearizing t he sequence based on t he t im e m arks .
m n017 [ s] : And t hen [ vocalsound] you ext ract t he individual channels
again ,
m n017 [ s] : but t his t im e you know where t he ot her people st art and
end t alking [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : you know , where t heir spurt s st art and end .

m n017 [ s] : And so y ou ext ract t he individual channels , uh , one sp
spurt by spurt as it were .
m n017 [ s] : Um , and inside t he words or bet ween t he words you now
have begin and end [ pause] t ags for overlaps .
m n017 [ s] : So , you [ disfm arker] you basically have everyt hing sort of
lined up and in a form where you can look at t he individual speakers
and how t heir speech relat es t o t he ot her speakers ’ speech .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
fe016 [ s] : Uh , I m ean , I t hink t hat ’s act ually really u useful also
m n017 [ %−] : And [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ qo^ df] : because even if you weren’t st udying overlaps , if you
wanna get a t ranscript ion for t he far − field m ikes , how are you gonna
know which words from which speakers occurred at which t im es
relat iv e t o each ot her ?
fe016 [ s] : You hav e t o be able t o [ pause] get a t ranscript like
[ disfm arker] like t his anyway , just for doing far − field recognit ion .
fe016 [ fh] : So ,
fe016 [ s.%−−] : you know , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s sort of [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s] : I t hi it ’s just an issue we haven’t dealt wit h before ,
fe016 [ s^ e.x ] : how y ou t im e − align t hings t hat are overlapping anyway
.
m n017 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s wonderful .
m e011 [ %−] : Well [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−] : And [ disfm arker] and we [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , i I never t hought about it before ,
m e011 [ s^ aap] : Y y es .
m n017 [ %−] : In [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ %−] : but [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : I m ean , s when I cam e up wit h t he original dat a
[ disfm arker] suggest ed dat a form at based on t he t ranscript ion graph ,
t here ’s capabilit y of doing t hat sort of t hing in t here .
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : But y ou can’t get it direct ly from t he t ranscript ion .
m n017 [ b.%] : Right .
fe008 [ s^ na] : Yeah , t hat ’s right .
m n017 [ s.%−] : Well , t his is [ disfm arker] t his is just [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , t his is like a poor m an ’s ver form at t ing version
.
fe016 [ s] : But it ’s , you know [ disfm arker] It ’s clean ,
fe016 [ s^ e] : it ’s just not fancy .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ s] : Well , t here ’s lot s of lit t le t hings .
fe016 [ fh] : Um .

m n017 [ s] : It ’s like t here ’re t welve different script s which you run
m n017 [ s] : and t hen at t he end you have what you want .
m n017 [ fh] : But , um ,
m n017 [ s] : at t he very last st age we t hrow away t he act ual t im e
inform at ion .
m n017 [ s] : All we care about is whet her [ disfm arker] t hat t here ’s a
cert ain word was overlapped by som eone else ’s word .
m n017 [ s] : So y ou sort of [ disfm arker] at t hat point , you discret ize
t hings int o just having overlap or no overlap .
m n017 [ s^ df] : Because we figure t hat ’s about t he level of analysis
t hat we want t o do for t his paper .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s:qw] : But if you want ed t o do a m ore fine − grained analysis
and say , you know , how far int o t he word is t he overlap , you could do
t hat .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : It ’s just [ disfm arker] it ’ll just require m ore [ disfm arker]
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe016 [ s^ ba] : Just [ pause] sort of huge .
m n017 [ s] : y ou know , slight ly different [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : What ’s int erest ing is it ’s exact ly what , um , i in discussing
wit h , um , Sue about t his ,
fe016 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : um , she , um , i i i indicat ed t hat t hat [ disfm arker] you know
, t hat ’s very im port ant for overlap analy sis .
fe016 [ s^ aa.x|s] : Yeah . It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s nice t o know ,
m n017 [ b.x] : Right .
fe016 [ s.x ] : and also I t hink as a hum an , like , I don’t always hear
t hese in t he act ual order t hat t hey occur .
fe016 [ s] : So I can have t wo foreground speakers ,
fe016 [ s^ e] : you know , Morgan an and [ vocalsound] um , Adam and
Jane could all be t alking ,
fe016 [ s] : and I could align each of t hem t o be st art ing t heir
ut t erance at t he correct t im e ,
fe016 [ s] : and t hen look where t hey are relat ive t o each ot her ,
fe016 [ s] : and t hat ’s not really what I heard .
fe008 [ s] : And t hat ’s anot her t hing she said .
fe016 [ s^ df] : Cuz it ’s just hard t o do .
fe008 [ s] : This is [ disfm arker] This is Bev er ’s [ disfm arker] Bever ’s
effect ,
fe008 [ s] : when [ disfm arker] where [ disfm arker] In psy ps psycho −
linguist ics y ou have t hese experim ent s where people have percept ual
biases a as t o what t hey hear ,
fe016 [ s^ aa] : Y Yeah .
fe016 [ s.%−] : It ’s sort of [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−] : t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] Not t he best
[ disfm arker]

fe016 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , you sort of m ov e t hings around unt il you get t o
a [ pause] low inform at ion point
fe016 [ s] : and yo t hen you can bring in t he ot her person .
fe016 [ s] : So it ’s [ vocalsound] act ually not even possible , I t hink , for
any person t o list en t o a m ixed signal ,
fe016 [ s] : ev en equalize , and m ake sure t hat t hey have all t he words
in t he right order .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe016 [ s] : So , I guess , we ’ll t ry t o writ e t his Eurospeech paper .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Superb .
fe016 [ s] : I m ean , we will writ e it .
fe016 [ s^ no] : Whet her t hey accept it [ pause] lat e or not , I don’t
know .
fe016 [ s] : Um , and t he good t hing is t hat we have [ disfm arker] It ’s
sort of a beginning of what Don can use t o link t he prosodic feat ures
from each file t o each ot her .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
