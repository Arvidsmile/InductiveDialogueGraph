m e013 [ fg] : Uh .
m e013 [ s^ co] : Som ebody else should run t his .
m e013 [ s^ df:qo] : I ’m sick of being t he one t o sort of go t hrough and
say , " Well , what do you t hink about t his ? "
m e013 [ %−] : You wanna [ disfm arker] ?
m e018 [ qy ^ cs^ rt ] : Should we t ake t urns ?
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy^ cs^ d^ rt ] : You want m e t o run it t oday ?
m e013 [ s^ co^ na] : Yeah . Why don’t you run it t oday ?
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ fg] : OK .
m e018 [ fg] : Um .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : Let ’s see , m aybe we should just get a list of it em s
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ e] : t hings t hat we should t alk about .
m e018 [ fh] : Um ,
m e018 [ s] : I guess t here ’s t he usual [ pause] updat es ,
m e018 [ s] : ev ery body going around and saying , uh , you know , what
t hey ’re working on ,
m e018 [ s] : t he t hings t hat happened t he last week .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : But aside from t hat is t here anyt hing in part icular t hat
anybody want s t o bring up
m n052 [ b] : Mm m .
m e018 [ s^ e^ rt ] : for t oday ?
m e018 [ s^ ar] : No ?
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ co] : So why don’t we just around and people can give
updat es .
fn002 [ b] : Oh .
m e018 [ qy^ cs^ rt ] : Uh , do you want t o st art , St ephane ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Alright .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : Well , t he first t hing m aybe is t hat t he p Eurospeech
paper is , uh , accept ed .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : This is [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker] what do you , uh
[ disfm arker] what ’s in t he paper t here ?
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : So it ’s t he paper t hat describe basically t he , um ,
sy st em t hat were proposed for t he [ pause] Aurora .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : The one t hat we s we subm it t ed t he last round
?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Right , yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .

m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker] Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So and t he , fff [ com m ent ] com m ent s seem s [ disfm arker]
from t he reviewer are good .
m n007 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : Where [ disfm arker] where ’s it gonna be t his year ?
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : It ’s , uh , Aalborg in Denm ark .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : And it ’s ,
m n007 [ fh] : y eah ,
m n007 [ s] : Sept em ber .
m e018 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Then , uh , whhh
m n007 [ s] : well , I ’ve been working on [ disfm arker] on t m ainly on on −
line norm alizat ion t his week .
m n007 [ fh|s] : Uh , I ’ve been t rying different [ disfm arker] slight ly
[ disfm arker] slight ly different approaches .
m n007 [ fh|s^ e^ rt ] : Um , t he first t hing is t rying t o play a lit t le bit
again wit h t he , um , t im e const ant .
m n007 [ s^ e] : Uh , second t hing is , uh , t he t raining of , uh , on − line
norm alizat ion wit h t wo different m eans ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : one m ean for t he silence and one for t he speech .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s] : and so I have t wo recursions which are cont rolled by t he ,
um , probabilit y of t he voice act ivit y det ect or .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m .
m n007 [ s] : This act ually don’t s doesn’t seem t o help ,
m n007 [ s] : alt hough it doesn’t hurt .
m n007 [ fh] : So .
m n007 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] well , bot h [ pause] on − line norm alizat ion
approach seem s equivalent .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : Are t he m eans pret t y different [ pause] for t he t wo ?
m n007 [ s.%−] : Well , t hey [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ na] : They can be v ery different .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah . Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ qy ^ bh] : Hm m .
m e013 [ qy^ rt ] : So do you m ay be m ake errors in different places ?
m e013 [ s^ e] : Different kinds of errors ?
m n007 [ s^ df] : I didn’t look , uh , m ore closely .
m n007 [ s^ na] : Um . It m ight be , y eah .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .

m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s] : Well , eh , t here is one t hing t hat we can observe , is t hat
t he m ean are m ore different for [ disfm arker] for C − zero and C − one
t han for t he ot her coefficient s .
m n007 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : And [ disfm arker] Yeah , it [ disfm arker] t he C − one is
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : There are st range [ disfm arker] st range t hing happening
wit h C − one , is t hat when you have different kind of noises , t he m ean
for t he [ disfm arker] t he silence port ion is [ disfm arker] can be different
.
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : So when you look at t he t raject ory of C − one , it ’s
[ disfm arker] has a st range shape
m n007 [ fh] : and
m n007 [ s] : I was ex pect ing t h t he s t hat t hese t wo m ean helps ,
m n007 [ s^ df] : especially because of t he [ disfm arker] t he st range C −
ze C − one shape ,
m n007 [ fh|s^ e] : uh , which can [ disfm arker] like , yo you can have ,
um , a t raject ory for t he speech
m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : and t hen when y ou are in t he silence it goes
som ewhere ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : but if t he noise is different it goes som ewhere else .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n007 [ s] : So which would m ean t hat if we est im at e t he m ean based
on all t he signal , even t hough we hav e fram e dropping , but we don’t
fram e ev uh , drop everyt hing ,
m n007 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] uh , t his can [ disfm arker] hurt s t he
est im at ion of t he m ean for speech ,
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ cc] : Mm m . [ com m ent ] But I st ill have t o invest igat e furt her
, I t hink .
m n007 [ fh|s^ rt ] : Um , a t hird t hing is , um , [ vocalsound] t hat inst ead
of t hav ing a fix ed t im e const ant , I t ry t o have a t im e const ant t hat ’s

m n007 [ s^ e] : t o adapt m ore quickly t o t he r som et hing t hat ’s closer
t o t he right m ean .
m n007 [ fh] : T t um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : And t hen t his t im e const ant increases
m n007 [ s.%−−] : and I have a t hreshold t hat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n007 [ s] : well , if it ’s higher t han a cert ain t hreshold , I keep it t o
t his t hreshold t o st ill , uh , adapt , um , t he m ean when [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] if t he ut t erance is , uh , long enough t o [ disfm arker] t o
cont inue t o adapt aft er , like , one second
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m .
m n007 [ fh|s] : Uh , well , t his doesn’t help neit her ,
m n007 [ s^ df] : but t his doesn’t hurt .
m n007 [ fh] : So , well .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : It seem s pret t y [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Wasn’t t here som e experim ent you were gonna t ry
m e018 [ s^ e.%−−] : where you did som et hing different ly for each , um ,
[ v ocalsound] uh [ disfm arker] I don’t know whet her it was each m el
band or each , uh , um , FFT bin or som et h
m e018 [ s^ e] : There was som et hing you were gonna [ disfm arker] uh ,
[ com m ent ] som e param et er you were gonna vary depending on t he
frequency .
m e018 [ s^ no.%−−] : I don’t know if t hat was [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s.%−−] : I guess it was [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m n007 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n007 [ s] : u Maybe it ’s t his [ disfm arker] t his idea of having different
[ pause] on − line norm alizat ion , um , t unings for t he different MFCC ’s .
m e018 [ s^ 2.%−−] : For each , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I t hought , Morgan , you brought it up a

m e018 [ s.%−−] : And t hen it was som et hing about , uh , som e
m e018 [ s.%−−:s.%−−] : and t hen som ebody said " yeah , it does seem
like , y ou know , C − zero is t he one t hat ’s , you know , t he m ajor one "
or , uh , s
m e018 [ s^ no] : I can’t rem em ber exact ly what it was now .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah . There [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa] : uh , act ually , yeah .
m n007 [ fh|s] : S um , it ’s very im port ant t o norm alize C − zero
m n007 [ s] : and [ pause] m uch less t o norm alize t he ot her coefficient s .
m n007 [ fh] : And , um ,
m n007 [ %−−] : act u
m n007 [ s^ e] : uh , well , at least wit h t he current on − line
norm alizat ion schem e .

m n007 [ fh] : And
m n007 [ s] : we [ disfm arker] I t hink , we [ v ocalsound] kind of know t hat
norm alizing C − one doesn’t help wit h t he current schem e .
m n007 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : In m y idea , I [ disfm arker] I was t hinking t hat t he
[ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he reason is m aybe because of t hese
funny t hings t hat happen bet ween speech and silence which have
different m eans .
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : But m aybe it ’s not so [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] so
easy t o [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg] : Um ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : I I really would like t o suggest looking , um , a lit t le bit
at t he kinds of errors .
m e013 [ s^ df] : I know you can get lost in t hat and go forever and not
see t oo m uch , but [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] som et im es ,
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker] but , um ,
m e013 [ s] : just seeing t hat each of t hese t hings didn’t m ake t hings
bet t er m ay not be enough .
m e013 [ s^ df] : It m ay be t hat t hey ’re m aking t hem bet t er in som e
way s and worse in ot hers ,
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ df] : or increasing insert ions and decreasing delet ions ,
m e013 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : or , um ,
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : y ou know , helping wit h noisy case
m e013 [ s^ df] : but hurt ing in quiet case .
m e013 [ s] : And if you saw t hat t hen m ay be you [ disfm arker] it would
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] som et hing would occur t o you of how t o deal
wit h t hat .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ b] : Hm m .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Alright .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : W um ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : So t hat ’s it , I t hink , for t he on − line norm alizat ion .
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ t c] : Yeah . I ’ve been play ing a lit t le bit wit h som e kind of
t hresholding ,

m n007 [ fh] : and ,
m n007 [ fh] : m m m ,
m n007 [ s.%−−] : as a first experim ent , I t hink I
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Well , what I did is t is t o t ake , um [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] t o m easure t he average [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bsc^ rt ] : no , t he m axim um energy of s each ut t erance
m n007 [ s.%−−] : and t hen put a t hreshold [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Well , t his for each m el band .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Then put a t hreshold t hat ’s fift een DB below
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : well , uh , a couple of DB below t his m axim um ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Act ually it was not a t hreshold ,
m n007 [ s^ df] : it was just adding noise .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : So I was adding a whit e noise energy ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : uh , t hat ’s fift een DB below t he m axim um energy of t he
ut t erance .
m n007 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : When we look at [ disfm arker] at t he , um , MFCC t hat
result from t his , t hey are [ pause] a lot m ore sm oot her .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s.%−−] : when we com pare , like , a channel zero and channel
one ut t erance [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh|s^ e] : um , so a clean and , uh , t he sam e noisy ut t erance
[ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : well , t here is alm ost no difference bet ween t he cepst ral
coefficient s of t he t wo .
m e018 [ qy^ bh] : Hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : And [ disfm arker] Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : And t he result t hat we hav e in t erm of speech
recognit ion , act ually it ’s not [ disfm arker] it ’s not worse ,
m n007 [ s^ df] : it ’s not bet t er neit her ,
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m n007 [ s] : but it ’s , um , kind of surprising t hat it ’s not worse
m n007 [ s^ df] : because basically y ou add noise t hat ’s fift een DB
[ disfm arker] just fift een DB below [ pause] t he m axim um energy .
m e006 [ s^ fa^ t 3] : Sorry .
m n007 [ %−] : And
m e018 [ qw] : So why does t hat m [ pause] sm oot h t hings out ?
m n007 [ s.%−] : at least [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ s^ no] : I don’t [ disfm arker] I don’t underst and t hat .
m e013 [ s|qy ^ d^ g] : Well , t here ’s less difference . Right ?
m n007 [ s] : It ’s [ disfm arker] I t hink , it ’s whit ening [ disfm arker] This
[ disfm arker] t he port ion t hat are m ore silent ,
m e013 [ s^ df.%−] : Cuz it ’s [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : as y ou add a whit e noise t hat are [ disfm arker] has a very
high energy , it whit ens everyt hing
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Huh . Oh , OK .
m n007 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : and t he high − energy port ion of t he speech don’t get
m uch affect ed any way by t he ot her noise .
m n007 [ s] : And as t he noise you add is t he sam e is [ disfm arker]
[ pause] t he shape , it ’s also t he sam e .
m e018 [ qy ^ bh] : Hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So t hey have [ disfm arker] t he t raject ory are very , very
sim ilar .
m n007 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : So , I m ean , again , if you t rained in one kind of noise and
t est ed in t he sam e kind of noise , y ou ’d [ disfm arker] you know , giv en
enough t raining dat a you don’t do b do badly .
m e013 [ s] : The reason t hat we d t hat we have t he problem s we have
is because [ pause] it ’s different in t raining and t est .
m e013 [ s^ e] : Ev en if [ vocalsound] t he general kind is t he sam e , t he
ex act inst ances are different .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker] and
m e013 [ fh|s] : so when you whit en it , t hen it ’s like you [ disfm arker]
t he [ disfm arker] t he only noise [ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker] t o first
order , t he only t h noise t hat you have is whit e noise
m e013 [ s] : and y ou ’ve added t he sam e t hing t o t raining and t est .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So it ’s ,
m e018 [ qy ^ bh] : Hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : So would t hat [ pause] be sim ilar t o , like , doing t he
sm oot hing , t hen , over t im e
m e018 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ na] : Well , it ’s a kind of sm oot hing ,
m n007 [ s^ nd] : I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s different .
m e013 [ %−] : but [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ df] : It ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s som et hing t hat [ disfm arker] yeah
, t hat affect s m ore or less t he silence port ions
m n007 [ s.%−−] : because [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m n007 [ s] : Well , anyway , t he sp t he port ion of speech t hat ha have
high energy are not ch a lot affect ed by t he noises in t he Aurora
dat abase .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s] : If [ disfm arker] if you com pare t h t he t wo shut channels of
SpeechDat − Car during speech port ion , it ’s n n n t he MFCC are not
v ery different .
m n007 [ s] : They are very different when energy ’s lower ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : like during fricat ives or during speech pauses .
m n007 [ fh] : And ,
m n007 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , but you ’re st ill get t ing m ore recognit ion
errors ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : which m eans [ vocalsound] t hat t he differences , even
t hough t hey look like t hey ’re not so big , [ vocalsound] are [ disfm arker]
are hurt ing your recognit ion .
m n007 [ %−] : Ye
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m n007 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . So it dist ort [ vocalsound] t he speech .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So perform ance went down ?
m n007 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n007 [ s^ nd] : It didn’t .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m n007 [ %−−] : But [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh|s] : So , but in t his case I [ disfm arker] I really expect t hat
m ay be t he [ disfm arker] t he t wo [ disfm arker] t hese t wo st ream of
feat ures , t hey are very different .
m n007 [ s^ cs] : I m ean , and m ay be we could gain som et hing by
com bining t hem
m e013 [ s] : Well , t he ot her t hing is t hat you just picked one part icular
way of doing it .
m n007 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|s] : Uh , I m ean , first place it ’s fift een DB , uh ,
[ v ocalsound] down across t he ut t erance .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : And [ vocalsound] m aybe y ou ’d want t o have
som et hing t hat was a lit t le m ore adapt ive .
m e013 [ s] : Secondly , you happened t o pick fift een DB
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and m aybe t went y ’d be bet t er ,
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : or [ disfm arker] or t welve .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah . Right .

m e018 [ qw] : So what was t he [ disfm arker] what was t he t hreshold
part of it ?
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : Was t he t hreshold , uh , how far down [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ no] : Well , he [ disfm arker] yeah , he had t o figure out how
m uch t o add .
m e013 [ s] : So he was looking [ disfm arker] he was looking at t he peak
v alue .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : And t hen [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qw.%−−] : And [ disfm arker] and so what ’s [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ no] : ho I don’t underst and .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : How does it go ?
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : If it [ disfm arker] if [ disfm arker] if t he peak value
’s abov e som e t hreshold , t hen you add t he noise ?
m e018 [ qrr.%−] : Or if it ’s below s
m n007 [ s^ na] : I syst em at ically [ com m ent ] add t he noise ,
m n007 [ s] : but t he , um , noise level is just [ pause] som e kind of
t hreshold below t he peak .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , oh . I see .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m .
m e018 [ s^ bk^ r] : I see .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s^ e] : Which is not really noise , act ually .
m n007 [ s^ e] : It ’s just adding a const ant t o each of t he m el , uh ,
energy .

m n007 [ s^ e] : To each of t he [ pause] m el filt er bank .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n007 [ s] : So , yeah , it ’s really , uh , whit e noise .
m n007 [ %−−] : I t h
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : So t hen aft erwards a log is t aken ,
m e013 [ s] : and t hat ’s so sort of why t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
t he lit t le v ariat ion t ends t o go away .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fg] : Um .
m n007 [ fg|s.%−−] : Yeah . So m ay
m n007 [ s] : Well , t he [ disfm arker] t his t hreshold is st ill a fact or t hat
we have t o look at .

m n007 [ s^ cs] : And I don’t know , m aybe a const ant noise addit ion
would [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] would be fine also ,
m n007 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Or [ disfm arker] or not const ant but [ disfm arker] but ,
uh , v ary ing ov er t im e [ pause] in fact is anot her way [ pause] t o go .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy^ rt ] : Were you using t he [ disfm arker] t he norm alizat ion in
addit ion t o t his ?
m e013 [ qw] : I m ean , what was t he rest of t he syst em ?
m n007 [ h] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Yeah . It was [ disfm arker] it was , uh , t he sam e syst em .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m n007 [ s^ r] : It was t he sam e syst em .
m n007 [ fh] : Mm m .
m n007 [ fg] : Oh , yeah .
m n007 [ s^ t c.%−−] : A t hird t hing is t hat , um , [ vocalsound] I play a lit t le
bit wit h t he , um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] finding what was different
bet ween , um ,
m n007 [ s] : And t here were a couple of differences ,
m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : like t he LDA filt ers were not t he sam e .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : he had t he France Telecom blind equalizat ion in t he
sy st em .
m n007 [ fh] : Um ,
m n007 [ s] : t he num ber o of MFCC t hat was [ disfm arker] were used
was different .
m n007 [ s^ e] : You used t hirt een
m n007 [ s^ e] : and we used fift een .
m n007 [ s] : Well , a bunch of differences .
m n007 [ fh|s] : And , um , act ually t he result t hat he [ disfm arker] he got
were m uch bet t er on TI − digit s especially .
m n007 [ s] : So I ’m kind of invest igat ed t o see what was t he m ain
fact or for t his difference .
m n007 [ s] : And it seem s t hat t he LDA filt er is [ disfm arker] is
[ disfm arker] was hurt ing .
m n007 [ fh|s^ rt ] : Um , [ vocalsound] so when we put s som e noise
com pensat ion t he , um , LDA filt er t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s deriv ed
from noisy speech is not m ore [ disfm arker] anym ore opt im al .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : And it m akes a big difference , um , [ vocalsound] on TI −
digit s

m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : t rained on clean .
m n007 [ s] : Uh , if we use t he [ disfm arker] t he old LDA filt er , I m ean
t he LDA filt er t hat was in t he proposal , we have , like , eight y − t wo
point seven percent recognit ion rat e ,
m n007 [ fh] : um ,
m n007 [ s^ e^ rt ] : on noisy speech when t he syst em is t rained on clean
speech .
m n007 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : and when we use t he filt er t hat ’s derived from clean
speech we jum ped [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ e] : so from eight y − t wo point seven t o eight y − five point
one ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : which is a huge leap .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m n007 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : So now t he result s are m ore sim ilar ,
m n007 [ fh] : and
m n007 [ s] : I don’t [ disfm arker] I will not , I t hink , invest igat e on t he
ot her differences ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : which is like t he num ber of MFCC t hat we keep and
ot her sm all t hings
m n007 [ s^ e] : t hat we can I t hink opt im ize lat er on anyway .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : But on t he ot her hand if ev erybody is t rying different
kinds of noise suppression t hings and so fort h , it m ight be good t o
st andardize on t he piece [ vocalsound] t hat we ’re not changing .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s^ df.%−−] : So if t here ’s any part icular reason t o ha pick one
or t he ot her ,
m e013 [ fh] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw] : Which [ disfm arker] which one is closer t o what t he
proposal was t hat was subm it t ed t o Aurora ?
m e013 [ qy .%−−] : Are t hey [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : t hey bot h [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Well , I m ean [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s.%−−] : I t hink [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : Yeah . I t hink t h t h uh , t he new syst em t hat I t est ed is , I
guess , closer
m n007 [ s^ df] : because it doesn’t have [ disfm arker] it have less of
[ disfm arker] of France Telecom st uff ,
m n052 [ s.%−] : You m ean t he [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ %−−] : I [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ bu|qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : The [ disfm arker] what ever you , uh , t est ed

m n007 [ %−] : But , we [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ co] : Tell t hem about t he rest of it .
m e013 [ s^ e] : Like you said t he num ber of filt ers m ight be
[ v ocalsound] different or som et hing .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m n052 [ qw^ d] : The num ber of cepst ral coefficient s is what ?
m e013 [ fh] : Or [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ %−−] : Cep
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : So , I m ean , I t hink we ’d wanna st andardize t here ,
m e013 [ qy ^ g^ rt ] : wouldn’t we ?
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , yeah .
m e013 [ fh|s^ cs] : So , sh you guys should pick som et hing

m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : Well , all t h all t hree of you .
m n007 [ s] : I t hink we were gonna work wit h [ disfm arker] wit h t his or
t his new sy st em ,
m n007 [ s.%−−] : or wit h [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ fg|s^ bu] : Uh , so t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] right now ,
t he [ disfm arker] t he syst em t hat is t here in t he [ disfm arker] what we

m n007 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n007 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n052 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n052 [ s^ aa^ r] : so [ disfm arker] Yeah ,
m n052 [ s^ aa^ r] : so [ disfm arker] Yep .
m n007 [ s] : But we will use t he [ disfm arker] t he LDA filt ers f derived
from clean speech .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah , yeah .
m n007 [ s] : Well , yeah , act ually it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not t he
[ disfm arker] t he LDA filt er .
m n052 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ s] : It ’s som et hing t hat ’s also short enough in [ disfm arker] in

m n052 [ b] : Yeah .
m n052 [ b] : Well .
m n007 [ fh] : So .
m n052 [ b] : Yeah .

m n052 [ s] : So , we haven’t [ disfm arker] w we hav e been always using ,

m n052 [ fh|s^ cs.%−−] : Yeah . Ma − m aybe we can [ disfm arker] I m ean ,
at least ,
m n052 [ fh|s^ cc] : um , I ’ll t s run som e experim ent s t o see whet her

m e006 [ s^ e] : So , for exam ple , um , [ vocalsound] if I know where
v oicing occurs and everyt hing , um , [ vocalsound] I would do a phone
[ disfm arker] um , phone recognit ion experim ent ,
m e006 [ fh|s^ e] : um , som ehow put t ing in t he [ disfm arker] t he , uh
[ disfm arker] t he perfect knowledge t hat I have about voicing .
m e006 [ fh|s] : So , um , in part icular I was t hinking , [ vocalsound] um ,
in [ disfm arker] in t he hybrid fram ework , just t aking t hose LNA files ,
[ v ocalsound] and , um , [ vocalsound] set t ing t o zero t hose
probabilit ies t hat , um [ disfm arker] t hat t hese phones are not voicing .
m e006 [ s^ e] : So say , like , I know t his part icular segm ent is voicing ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e006 [ fh|s^ e] : um , [ vocalsound] I would say , uh , go int o t he
corresponding LNA file and zonk out t he [ disfm arker] t he post eriors for
, um , t hose phonem es t hat , um , are not voiced ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ s] : and t hen see what kinds of im provem ent s I get .
m e018 [ qy ^ bh] : Hm m .
m e006 [ s^ df] : And so t his would be a useful t hing , um , t o know
[ v ocalsound] in t erm s of , like , which [ disfm arker] which , um
[ disfm arker] which of t hese cat egories are [ disfm arker] are good for ,

m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ fh|%−−] : So , t hat ’s [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s^ cc] : I hope t o get t hose , uh [ disfm arker] t hose
ex perim ent s done by [ disfm arker] by t he t im e quals com e [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : So do you just t ake t he probabilit ies of t he ot her ones
and spread t hem out evenly am ong t he [ disfm arker] t he rem aining

m e006 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e006 [ s.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I was t hinking [ disfm arker]
m e006 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , so just set t o [ disfm arker] set t o som e really low

m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e006 [ s] : And t hen renorm alize .

m e018 [ s^ bu.%−−] : Oh , so t hen you ’ll feed t hose [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ fa] : Sorry .

m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : So where do t he out put s of t he net go int o if you ’re
doing phone recognit ion ?
m e006 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e006 [ fh|s] : Um , t he out put s of t he net go int o t he st andard , h um
, ICSI hy brid , um , recognizer .
m e006 [ s] : So m aybe , um , Chronos
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : An − and you ’re gonna [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] you ’re gonna do phone recognit ion wit h t hat ?

m e018 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e006 [ fh] : So .
m e006 [ fh|s^ cs] : And , uh , anot her t hing would be t o ext end t his t o ,
uh , digit s or som et hing where I can look at whole words .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e006 [ s^ df] : And I would be able t o see , uh , not just , like ,

m n007 [ b] : Oh .
m e018 [ fh|s^ cc^ t c] : So , um , [ vocalsound] I guess I ’ll just pass it on
t o Dav e .
m e026 [ s^ bk] : Uh , OK .
m e026 [ s] : Well , in m y lunch t alk last week I [ disfm arker] I said I ’d
t ried phase norm alizat ion and got t en garbage result s using t hat l um ,

m e026 [ s^ df] : It t urned out t here was a bug in m y Mat lab code .
m e026 [ s] : So I t ried it again ,

m e026 [ fh] : um ,
m e026 [ fh|s] : and , um , t he result s [ v ocalsound] were [ disfm arker]
were bet t er .
m e026 [ s^ e] : I got int elligible speech back .
m e026 [ s] : But t hey st ill weren’t as good as just subt ract ing t he
m agnit ude [ disfm arker] t he log m agnit ude m eans .
m e026 [ s] : And also I ’ve been t alking t o , um , Andreas and Thilo
about t he , um , Sm art Kom language m odel

m e026 [ fh] : So
m e026 [ s^ cc] : I ’m gonna be working on , um , im plem ent ing t his
m ean subt ract ion approach in t he [ vocalsound] far − m ike syst em
[ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s^ bsc] : for t he Sm art Kom syst em , I m ean .
m e026 [ fh] : And , um ,
m e026 [ s^ cc] : one of t he experim ent s we ’re gonna do is , um , we ’re
gonna , um , t rain t he [ disfm arker] a Broadcast News net ,
m e026 [ s^ df] : which is because t hat ’s what we ’ve been using so far ,
m e026 [ s^ cc] : and , um , adapt it on som e ot her dat a . Um , An −
Andreas want s t o use ,
m e026 [ fh] : um ,
m e026 [ s^ e] : dat a t hat resem bles read speech ,
m e026 [ s^ e] : like [ pause] t hese digit readings ,
m e026 [ s^ df] : because he feels t hat t he Sm art Kom syst em
int eract ion is not gonna be exact ly conv ersat ional .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e026 [ qw] : S so act ually I was wondering , how long does it t ake t o
t rain t hat Broadcast News net ?
m e013 [ s] : The big one t akes a while .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ e] : Yeah . That t akes t wo , t hree weeks .
m e026 [ s^ bk^ m ] : Two , t hree weeks .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So [ disfm arker] but , you know , uh , you can get
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I don’t know if you even want t o run t he big one , uh , um ,
in t he [ disfm arker] in t he final syst em ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : cuz , you know , it t akes a lit t le while t o run it .
m e013 [ fh|s^ cs.%−−] : So , [ vocalsound] um , you can scale it down by
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ fa] : I ’m sorry ,
m e013 [ s] : it was t wo , t hree weeks for t raining up for t he large
Broadcast News t est set [ disfm arker] t raining set .
m e026 [ b] : Oh .
m e013 [ s] : I don’t know how m uch you ’d be t raining on .
m e026 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : The full ?

m e013 [ s] : Uh , i so if you t rained on half as m uch [ vocalsound] and
m ade t he net , uh , uh , half as big , t hen it would be one fourt h
[ pause] t he am ount of t im e
m e026 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : and it ’d be nearly as good .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e026 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Also , I guess we had [ disfm arker] we ’ve had t hese , uh ,

m e013 [ s] : I guess y ou ha hav en’t had a chance t o work wit h it t oo
m uch [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : about [ disfm arker] about , uh [ disfm arker] uh , uh m ot her
way s of t aking care of t he phase .
m e026 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh|s] : So , I m ean , I [ disfm arker] I guess t hat was som et hing I
could say would be t hat we ’ve t alked a lit t le bit about
m e013 [ s^ e] : y ou just doing it all wit h com plex arit hm et ic
m e013 [ fh] : and , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : and not [ disfm arker] not , uh , doing t he polar
represent at ion wit h m agnit ude and phase .
m e013 [ s] : But [ v ocalsound] it looks like t here ’s ways t hat one could
pot ent ially just work wit h t he com plex num bers and [ disfm arker] and
[ disfm arker] and in principle get rid of t he [ vocalsound] effect s of t he
av erage com plex spect rum .
m e013 [ %−−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ fg] : And , um ,
m e026 [ s.%−−] : act ually , regarding t he phase norm alizat ion
[ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s] : So I did t wo experim ent s ,
m e026 [ s^ e.%−−] : and one is [ disfm arker]
m e026 [ s] : So , phases get added , m odulo t wo pi ,
m e026 [ s^ df] : and [ disfm arker] because y ou only know t he phase of
t he com plex num ber t t t o a value m odulo t wo pi .
m e026 [ s] : And so I t hought at first , um , t hat , uh , what I should do
is unwrap t he phase
m e026 [ s^ df] : because t hat will undo t hat .
m e026 [ fh|s] : Um , but I act ually got worse result s doing t hat
unwrapping using t he sim ple phase unwrapper t hat ’s in Mat lab t han I
did not unwrapping at all .
m e018 [ qy^ bh] : Hm m .
m n052 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : P So .
m e026 [ s] : And t hat ’s all I hav e t o say .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .

m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m st ill hopeful t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , we [ disfm arker] we don’t even know if t he phase
[ v ocalsound] is som et hing [ disfm arker] t he average phase is
som et hing t hat we do want t o rem ove .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , m aybe t here ’s som e deeper reason why it isn’t
t he right t hing t o do .
m e013 [ fh] : But , um ,
m e013 [ s] : at least in principle it looks like t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here
’s , uh , a couple pot ent ial way s t o do it .
m e013 [ s^ e] : One [ disfm arker] one being t o just work wit h t he
com plex num bers ,
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ fh|s^ e] : and , uh [ disfm arker] in rect angular kind of
coordinat es .
m e013 [ s^ e] : And t he ot her is [ vocalsound] t o , uh , do a Taylor
series [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : Well .
m e013 [ s^ df] : So y ou work wit h t he com plex num bers
m e013 [ s^ df] : and t hen when you get t he spect rum [ disfm arker] t he
av erage com plex spect rum [ disfm arker] um , act ually divide it out ,
m e013 [ fh|s^ e] : um , as opposed t o t aking t he log and subt ract ing .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So t hen ,
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ s] : y ou know , t here m ight be som e num erical issues .
m e013 [ s^ no] : We don’t really know t hat .
m e013 [ s] : The ot her t hing we t alked a lit t le bit about was Taylor
series ex pansion .
m e013 [ fh] : And , um ,
m e013 [ fh|s] : uh , act ually I was t alking t o Dick Karp about it a lit t le bit
,
m e013 [ s^ df] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and , since I got
t hinking about it ,
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and , uh ,
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : so one t hing is t hat y you ’d have t o do , I t hink ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : we m ay have t o do t his on a whit eboard ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : but I t hink you have t o be a lit t le careful about scaling
t he num bers t hat y ou ’re [ vocalsound] t aking [ disfm arker] t he com plex
num bers t hat you ’re t aking t he log of
m e013 [ s^ df] : because [ vocalsound] t he Taylor expansion for it has ,
y ou know , a square and a cube , and [ disfm arker] and so fort h .

m e013 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and so if [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] if you
have a [ disfm arker] a num ber t hat is m odulus , you know , uh , very
different from one [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] It should be right around
one ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : if it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ df] : cuz it ’s a expansion of log one [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ e] : one m inus epsilon
m e013 [ s^ e] : or o is [ disfm arker] is [ vocalsound] one plus epsilon ,
m e013 [ qy ^ bu.%−−] : or is it one plus [ disfm arker] ?
m e013 [ s] : Well , t here ’s an epsilon squared over t wo
m e026 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : and an epsilon cubed over t hree ,
m e013 [ s] : and so fort h .
m e013 [ s] : So if epsilon is bigger t han one , t hen it diverges .
m e026 [ b] : Oh .
m e013 [ s] : So you have t o do som e scaling .
m e013 [ s^ bd] : But t hat ’s not a big deal
m e013 [ s^ df] : cuz it ’s t he log of [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] of K t im es
a com plex num ber ,
m e013 [ s] : t hen you can just [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t he sam e as log of K
plus [ v ocalsound] log of t he com plex num ber .
m e026 [ b] : Oh .
m e026 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : so t here ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : converges .
m e013 [ fh] : But .
m e018 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ qo^ rt ^ t c] : How about you , Sunil ?
m n052 [ h|s] : So , um , I ’ve been , uh , im plem ent ing t his , uh , Wiener
filt ering for t his Aurora t ask .
m n052 [ fh] : And , uh ,
m n052 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I act ually t hought it was [ disfm arker] it was
doing fine when I t est ed it once .
m n052 [ s] : I it ’s , like , using a sm all sect ion of t he code .
m n052 [ s] : And t hen I ran t he whole recognit ion experim ent wit h
It alian
m n052 [ s] : and I got , [ vocalsound] like , worse result s t han not using
it .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : Then I [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : So , I ’ve been t rying t o find where t he problem cam e from .
m n052 [ s] : And t hen it looks like I have som e problem in t he way
[ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ df] : t here is som e [ disfm arker] som e very silly bug
som ewhere .

m n052 [ s^ fe] : And , ugh !
m n052 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I m ean , i uh , it act ually [ disfm arker] i it
act ually m ade t he whole t hing worse .
m n052 [ s] : I was looking at t he spect rogram s t hat I got
m n052 [ s] : and it ’s , like [ disfm arker] w it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s very
horrible .
m n052 [ s^ e.%−] : Like , when I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] I m issed t he v
m e013 [ s^ fa] : I ’m sorry ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : I was [ disfm arker] I was dist ract ed .
m e013 [ s] : I m issed t he very first sent ence .
m e013 [ s] : So t hen , I ’m a lit t le lost on t he rest .
m n052 [ s.%−] : Oh , I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qw.%−] : What [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker]
?
m n052 [ s^ bk] : Oh , yeah .
m n052 [ s] : I act ually im plem ent ed t he Wiener f f fil filt ering as a
m odule and t hen t est ed it out separat ely .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , I see .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n052 [ s] : And it [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it gave , like [ disfm arker]
I just got t he signal out
m n052 [ s] : and it [ disfm arker] it was OK .
m n052 [ s] : So , I plugged it in som ewhere
m n052 [ s] : and t hen [ disfm arker] I m ean , it ’s like I had t o rem ove
som e part
m n052 [ s] : and t hen plugging it in som ewhere .
m n052 [ s] : And t hen I [ disfm arker] in t hat process I m essed it up
som ewhere .
m n052 [ fh] : So .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m n052 [ s.%−−] : So , it was real
m n052 [ s] : I m ean , I t hought it was all fine
m n052 [ s] : and t hen I ran it , and I got som et hing worse t han not
using it .
m n052 [ fh] : So ,
m n052 [ s] : I was like [ disfm arker] I ’m t ry ing t o find where t he m m
problem cam e ,
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n052 [ s] : and it seem s t o be , like , som ewhere [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : OK .
m n052 [ s^ e] : som e silly st uff .
m n052 [ fh|s^ t c.%−−] : And , um , t he ot her t hing , uh , was , uh , uh
[ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : Well , Hy nek showed up one [ disfm arker] suddenly on one
day

m n052 [ s.%−−] : and t hen I was t t alking wi
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ j] : As [ disfm arker] as he is wont t o do .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n052 [ fg] : Uh , y eah .
m n052 [ s] : So I was act ually [ disfm arker] t hat day I was t hinking about
d doing som et hing about t he Wiener filt ering , and t hen Carlos m at t er
of st uff .
m n052 [ s] : And t hen he showed up
m n052 [ s] : and t hen I t old him .
m n052 [ s] : And t hen he gave m e a whole bunch of filt ers [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ e] : what Carlos used for his , uh , uh , t hesis
m n052 [ s] : and t hen [ vocalsound] t hat was som et hing which cam e up
.
m n052 [ fh] : And t hen , um [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : So , uh , I ’m act ually , [ vocalsound] uh , t hinking of using
t hat also in t his , uh , W Wiener filt ering
m n052 [ s^ df] : because t hat is a m m odified Wiener filt ering approach
,
m n052 [ s^ e] : where inst ead of using t he current fram e , it uses
[ v ocalsound] adjacent fram es also in designing t he Wiener filt er .
m n052 [ s] : So inst ead of designing our own new Wiener filt ers , I m ay
just use one of t hose Carlos filt ers in [ disfm arker] in t his
im plem ent at ion
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ s] : and see whet her it [ disfm arker] it act ually gives m e
som et hing bet t er
m n052 [ s^ e] : t han using just t he current f current fram e ,
m n052 [ s^ e] : which is in a way , uh , som et hing like t he sm oot hing
[ disfm arker] t he Wiener filt er [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n052 [ fh] : but @ @ [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ fh] : S so , I don’t know ,
m n052 [ s.%−−] : I was h
m n052 [ s.%−−] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m , like [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s] : t hat [ disfm arker] so t hat is t he next t hing . Once t his
[ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] once I sort t his pro uh , problem out m aybe I
’ll just go int o t hat also .
m n052 [ fh] : And
m n052 [ s^ t c] : t he [ disfm arker] t he ot her t hing was about t he
subspace approach .
m n052 [ fh] : So , um ,
m n052 [ s] : I , like , plugged som e groupings for com put ing t his eigen
uh , uh , uh , s v alues and eigenvect ors .

m n052 [ s] : So just [ disfm arker] I just @ @ som e sm all block of t hings
which I needed t o put t oget her for t he subspace approach .
m n052 [ s] : And I ’m in t he process of , like , building up t hat st uff .
m n052 [ fh] : And , um ,
m n052 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker] [ nonvocalsound] Yeah .
m n052 [ s] : I guess [ disfm arker] Yep . I guess t hat ’s it .
m n052 [ s] : And , uh , t h t h t hat ’s where I am right now .
m n052 [ fh] : So .
m e018 [ qo^ t c] : Oh . How about you , Carm en ?
fn002 [ s] : Mm m . I ’m working wit h VTS .
fn002 [ fh|s] : Um , I do several experim ent wit h t he Spanish dat abase

fn002 [ s^ e] : only wit h VTS and not hing m ore .
fn002 [ s^ e] : Not VAD ,
fn002 [ s^ e] : no LDA ,
fn002 [ s^ e] : not hing m ore .
m e018 [ qw^ rt ] : What [ disfm arker] what is VTS again ?
m n052 [ %−] : New [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ s] : Eh , Vect orial Taylor Series .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh , yes .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Right , right .
fn002 [ s] : To rem ove t he noise t oo .
m e018 [ s] : I t hink I ask you t hat every single m eet ing ,
m e018 [ qy ^ g] : don’t I ?
fn002 [ qw^ br] : What ?
m e018 [ s] : I ask you t hat quest ion every m eet ing .
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fn002 [ %−] : If [ disfm arker] Well [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ j] : So , t hat ’d be good from [ disfm arker] for analysis .
m e013 [ s^ df^ j] : It ’s good t o have som e , uh , cases of t he sam e

m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ qw^ j] : " What is VTS ? "
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
fn002 [ s^ m ] : VTS .
fn002 [ s.%−−] : I ’m sor
fn002 [ s.%−−] : Well , um , t he quest ion is t hat [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ fh] : Well .
fn002 [ s] : Rem ov e som e noise but not t oo m uch .
fn002 [ fh|s] : And when we put t he [ disfm arker] m m t he , em , VAD ,
t he result is bet t er .
fn002 [ s] : And we put everyt hing , t he result is bet t er ,
fn002 [ s] : but it ’s not bet t er t han t he result t hat we have wit hout VTS
.
fn002 [ s^ ar] : No , no .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : So t hat @ @ [ com m ent ] given t hat you ’re using t he

fn002 [ s^ na] : Is not .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : Do y ou [ disfm arker] How m uch of t hat do you t hink is
due t o just t he part icular im plem ent at ion and how m uch you ’re

m e013 [ qw.%−−] : Or how m uch do you t hink is int rinsic t o [ disfm arker] ?
fn002 [ s^ no] : Pfft . I don’t know
fn002 [ s^ df.%−−] : because [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ fh] : Hhh ,

m n007 [ qrr.%−−] : Or i ?
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m n007 [ b] : Hm m .
fn002 [ s] : And also I did som e experim ent , [ vocalsound] uh , doing ,

m n007 [ s^ cs] : Maybe you hav e t o st andardize t his t hing also ,
m n007 [ s^ e] : noise est im at ion ,
m n007 [ s^ df.%−−] : because all t he t hing t hat you are t est ing use a

m n007 [ s^ df] : They all need som e [ disfm arker] som e noise
[ disfm arker] noise spect ra
fn002 [ s^ ar|s] : No , I do t hat t wo [ disfm arker] t did t wo t im e .
m n007 [ s^ df] : but t hey use [ disfm arker] every [ disfm arker] all use a

m e013 [ s] : I hav e an idea .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : If [ disfm arker] if , uh , uh ,
m e013 [ s^ aa] : y you ’re right .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , each of t hese require t his .
m e013 [ qw^ cs] : Um , given t hat we ’re going t o have for t his t est at

fn002 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : Right ?

m e013 [ fh] : S so , e um ,

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ df] : first place , I m ean even if ult im at ely we wouldn’t be

m e013 [ qw] : I m ean , how m uch is t he poor [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
y ou know , relat ively , uh , unhelpful result t hat you ’re get t ing in t his or

m n007 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ s^ df] : So m aybe if you t est ed it using t hat , [ vocalsound] you

fn002 [ s.%−−] : Uh , t his is t he [ disfm arker]
m n052 [ s^ t 1] : Weak .
m n052 [ s^ t 1] : So probably it [ disfm arker] it would do t hat .
fn002 [ s^ rt ] : like t his ,
m n007 [ s^ bu|qy^ d^ g] : It ’s one m ix t ure of t he m odel . Right ?
fn002 [ s] : but condit ional .
fn002 [ s^ ar|s^ nd.%−] : No , it ’s condit ion
fn002 [ s^ nd] : it ’s not exact ly t his .
fn002 [ s] : It ’s m odify .
fn002 [ fh|s] : Uh , if we have clean speech [ disfm arker] we have t he

fn002 [ x ] : Now .
fn002 [ s] : And t his is fixed .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fn002 [ s] : If I never do an est im at a newer est im at ion of t he noise ,
t his m ean as [ disfm arker] m ean and t he variance are fixed .

fn002 [ s] : And for each s uh , fram e of t he speech t he only t hing t hat I
need t o do is t o calculat e t his
fn002 [ s^ e] : in order t o calculat e t he est im at ion of t he clean speech
giv en our noisy speech .
m e013 [ s] : So , I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m not following t his perfect ly
m e013 [ fh] : but , um ,
m e013 [ %−−] : I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Are you saying t hat all of t hese est im at es are

fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : And never change t hroughout anyt hing else ?
fn002 [ s^ m ^ na.%−−] : Never cha
fn002 [ s] : This is one of t he approx im at ions t hat I am doing .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : Per [ disfm arker] per [ disfm arker] per ut t erance ,

fn002 [ s^ df] : It ’s fixed , t he dict ionary .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fn002 [ s^ rt ] : And t he ot her est im at ion is when I do t he uh on − line
est im at ion , I change t he m eans and variance of t h for t he noisy

m e013 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ qy ^ bh^ rt ] : Yeah ?
fn002 [ s^ e] : each t im e t hat I det ect noise .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

m e013 [ s^ aa] : Well , yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ng] : But , I m ean , [ vocalsound] no [ disfm arker] no paper is
[ disfm arker] is a Bible ,
fn002 [ s] : Yeah , m aybe isn’t t he right t hing .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : you know .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : This is [ disfm arker] t his is , uh [ disfm arker]
fn002 [ b] : Yeah , y eah , yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : The quest ion is , um , [ vocalsound] whet her it would be

[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So , suppose you did [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : This is alm ost cheat ing .
m e013 [ s] : It cert ainly isn’t real − t im e .
m e013 [ s] : But if y suppose you use t he real boundaries t hat
[ disfm arker] t hat you were [ disfm arker] in fact were given [ vocalsound]
by t he VAD and so fort h
m e013 [ s] : or I [ disfm arker] I guess we ’re gonna be given even bet t er

m e013 [ s] : so you have a fair am ount .
m e013 [ qy] : Do y ou benefit from having a bet t er m odel for t he noise ?
m e013 [ s] : That would be anot her quest ion .
fn002 [ s^ am ] : May be .
m e013 [ s] : So first quest ion would be [ v ocalsound] t o what ext ent i
are t he errors t hat you ’re st ill seeing [ vocalsound] based on t he fact
t hat y ou have poor boundaries for t he , uh , uh , nonspeech ?
m e013 [ s] : And t he second quest ion m ight be , given t hat you have
good boundaries , could you do bet t er if you used m ore param et ers t o
charact erize t he noise ?
m e013 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Also anot her quest ion m ight be [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh|qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Um , t hey are doing [ disfm arker] t hey ’re
using first t erm only of t he vect or Taylor series ?
fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|qy ^ rt ] : Um , if you do a second t erm does it get t oo

fn002 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah . It ’s quit e com plicat ed .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , OK .
m e013 [ s^ cc] : No , I won’t ask t he nex t quest ion t hen .

m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : No , it ’s int erest ing .
m e013 [ s^ df] : Uh , w we haven’t had anybody work wit h it before ,
m e013 [ s] : so it ’s int erest ing t o get your [ disfm arker] get your
