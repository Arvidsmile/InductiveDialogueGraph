m n007 [ s] : So I guess t here was again a [ vocalsound] conference call
but uh t hey are not decide on [ vocalsound] every t hing yet .
m n007 [ s^ rt ] : For t he VAD t hey [ disfm arker] probably t hey will do
som et hing like [ vocalsound] having som e kind of idealized VAD t hat
t hey could [ v ocalsound] run on t he channel zero [ vocalsound] of t he
SpeechDat − Car
m n007 [ s^ e] : and t hen t ake t he sam e um end point s and apply t hem
on channel one
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ %−] : so it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu] : Oh so t ake a real VAD but apply it t o [ disfm arker] t o
[ disfm arker] t o t he clean [ disfm arker] clean dat a .
m n007 [ %−] : Uh g
m n007 [ s^ na] : Yeah , t o t he clean and t ake t he end point s for t he
noisy .
m n007 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n007 [ s^ am ] : But I am not sure t his is decided yet .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : And [ disfm arker] and i when t hey ’re t alking about it ,
do y ou hav e t he im pression t hat t hey ’re t alking about [ vocalsound] a
part icular VAD which everybody would use ?
m e013 [ qrr] : or [ disfm arker] or just t hat everybody would use t he
sam e procedure ?
m n007 [ s] : Well , probably uh s t he sam e VAD [ vocalsound] for
ev ery body .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ fh] : Um .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : So t hey would just provide t hat as part of t he dat a .
m n007 [ s^ am ] : Maybe .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : But t his is st ill [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Sounds like t hey ’re st ill arguing .

m n007 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : Not hing m uch .
m n007 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n007 [ s] : Probably t he um [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t hese weight
t hings , t hey will [ vocalsound] apply t he sam e kind of weight ing
schem e for [ v ocalsound] TI − digit s t han for t he SpeechDat − Car .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : So it would be weight ing of
m n007 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]

m n007 [ s] : It would be an average of im provem ent s rat her t han an
av erage of [ vocalsound] word error rat es which would m ake
[ v ocalsound] t he m ore clean part s of TI − digit s m ore im port ant t han
t hey are right now .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : Uh but it sounds like none of t his is really decided , t hat
t his is how t hings are leaning
m n007 [ %−−] : This

fn002 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : OK .

m e013 [ fh] : Uh .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : So it sounds like basically t hings are slowing down

m n007 [ s^ ar] : No .
m n007 [ s.%−−] : Well , I [ disfm arker] I sent m ails t o st art t he

m e013 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : Dave ?

m e026 [ s^ na] : Well um . [ vocalsound] One t hing in [ disfm arker] in t he
paper Av endano and his collaborat ors wrot e [ vocalsound] is t hat
[ disfm arker] is t hat um [ vocalsound] t hey t ried doing channel
norm alizat ion on t he reverberant in speech by um [ vocalsound]
subt ract ing t he m ean of t he log spect ral m agnit ude [ vocalsound] over
a t wo second window .
m e026 [ s] : But t hey didn’t do anyt hing wit h t he phase , and t hey said
perhaps t hat lim it ed t heir approach t hat it did not t ry t o norm alize t he
phase in any way .
m e026 [ s^ cc] : So I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m going t o st art t hinking about
[ v ocalsound] um way s t hat t he ph t hat t he phase could be used .
m e026 [ fh] : Um .
m e026 [ s] : Si − if [ disfm arker] if t he um channel [ vocalsound] and t he
rev erberat ion is m ult iplicat ive in t he frequency dom ain wit h t he speech
spect rum t hen t he [ vocalsound] phases should be addit ive .
m e026 [ fh|s] : So um perhaps just subt ract ing t he m ean of t he phase
would [ disfm arker] would help .
m e026 [ s] : Um but I don’t know I t h I get t he im pression t hat t hey t ried
t o do som e t hings wit h t he phase and t hey weren’t successful .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s] : Oh . You know , t here is one ot her t hing .
m e018 [ fh|s] : Um St ephane showed m e a paper yest erday
[ v ocalsound] um where t h uh for t he It alian syst em t hey had done a
series of experim ent s playing around wit h t he um [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] t he num ber of it erat ions , t hat I t alked about last week ?
m e018 [ fh|s] : And , um , so , t here was a whole series of t hose t hat
t hey had done .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : They didn’t , I don’t t hink , report ed t im ing [ vocalsound] for
t hose ,
m e018 [ fh|s] : but um [ vocalsound] it t urns out t hat t he one t hat t hey
’re act ually using was not t he best , uh in [ disfm arker] in t heir series of
ex perim ent s , which I uh [ disfm arker] May be it ’s because t hey
[ v ocalsound] uh want ed t o use t he sam e num ber of it erat ions across
all different languages and t his was only done on It alian or som et hing .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Sure .
m e013 [ qw^ rt ] : Wh − who ’s t hey [ disfm arker] t hey ?
m e018 [ s^ no] : Uh , I don’t know who did it
m e018 [ qy ] : do you know , St ephane ?
m e018 [ qw] : Who did t hat ?
m n007 [ h] : Um .
m n007 [ s^ no] : I don’t know
m n007 [ s] : but it ’s t he com pany who prepared t he It alian dat abase ,
m n007 [ s.%−−] : so it was [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ qy] : Is it Alcat el ,
m n007 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?

fn002 [ s^ aa] : I t hink so .
m n007 [ %−−] : I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Mm m .
m n007 [ s^ no] : I don’t know .
m e018 [ fh|s] : So um [ vocalsound] you know t here wasn’t a huge
difference in t erm s of t he perform ance across all t he different
ex perim ent s t hat t hey did .
m e018 [ fh|s] : Um . But it varied a lit t le bit .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : And uh [ disfm arker] So I guess t he m ain t hing t hat I
t ake out of t hat is t hat I t hink t hat for our purposes here we could
definit ely [ v ocalsound] you know decrease t he num ber of it erat ions
t hat we do
m e018 [ fh] : and um ,
m e018 [ s] : at least while we ’re , you know , working on uh
[ v ocalsound] all different of kinds of v ariat ions , and t hat would let us ,
y ou know , pum p t hrough a lot m ore experim ent s .
m e018 [ fh|s] : So um I st ill have t o [ disfm arker] t o send everybody a
point er about uh [ v ocalsound] how t o run t he um [ vocalsound] HTK
sy st em [ vocalsound] on t he Linux boxes and about changing t hese
num ber of it erat ions so t hat [ disfm arker] so t hat you can do t hat .
m e018 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um . [ vocalsound] So t he [ disfm arker] t he ot her
t hing t hat t hat I was t hinking about m ay be t rying out next is
m e018 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ fe] : Oh !
m e018 [ s] : The ot her t h t he ot her ex perim ent t hat t hey had in t hat
paper was uh uh play ing wit h t he num ber of Gaussians per st at e .
m e018 [ s.%−] : And so .
m n007 [ fg] : Uh .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n007 [ s^ arp] : I t hink it ’s [ disfm arker] was playing wit h t he num ber
of st at es per word .
m n007 [ s] : They had sixt een , sevent een , eight een .
m n007 [ s] : Yeah , because it was around [ disfm arker] bet ween
six t een and t went y
m n007 [ %−] : or [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : I should look at t hat m ore carefully cuz I wonder what
t hey did about [ disfm arker]
m n007 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fg] : Oh , OK .
m e018 [ s] : I was t hinking it was Gaussians but it ’s st at es .
m n007 [ fg] : So , and [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : OK .
m n007 [ s] : Yeah , apparent ly , um [ vocalsound] t hey had bet t er
result s when t hey increased t he num ber of st at es .

m n007 [ s.%−−] : From [ disfm arker] from eight een t o t went y , or
[ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : So . [ vocalsound] The t hing I was t hinking about was uh ,
y ou know , t he num ber of insert ions really goes up when you
[ v ocalsound] st art adding all t he noise in ,
m e018 [ s^ cs] : and m aybe t he t hing t o do next would be t o t ry t o um
[ v ocalsound] uh m ake t he silence m odel m ore powerful ,
m e018 [ s^ cs] : y ou know , increasing t he num ber of Gaussians t o t he
num ber of st at es , different [ disfm arker] different t hings like t hat ,
m e018 [ s] : so . [ vocalsound] That ’s probably t he next lit t le t hing I ’ll
play wit h when I get a chance
m e013 [ fg] : Um .
m e013 [ fg] : Let ’s see .
m e013 [ fh|s^ cs^ t ^ t c] : Um . Why don’t [ disfm arker] why don’t we uh
[ disfm arker] if t here aren’t any ot her m ajor t hings , why don’t we do
t he digit s , and t hen [ disfm arker] t hen uh t urn t he m ikes off .
m e013 [ z] : So I ’ll st art .
m e013 [ z] : Uh .
m n007 [ z] : D ’ you put t wo ?
