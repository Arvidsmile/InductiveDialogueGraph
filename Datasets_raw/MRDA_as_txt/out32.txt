[ disfm arker] if it st art s cat ching zeros , like in t he driv er or som et hing
[ disfm arker]
m e001 [ z] : in t he card , or som ewhere in t he hardware [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ z] : Where if you st art seeing zeros on w across one channel ,
y ou just add som e [ vocalsound] random , @ @ [ com m ent ] noise floor
[ disfm arker]
m e001 [ z] : like a sm all noise floor .
m e011 [ z] : I m ean cert ainly we could do t hat ,
m e011 [ z] : but I don’t t hink t hat ’s a good idea .
m e011 [ z] : We can do t hat in post − processing if [ disfm arker] if t he

m e001 [ z] : OK .
m e013 [ z] : but [ v ocalsound] t hen I realized t hat put t ing in a random

fe008 [ s^ df] : It ’s [ disfm arker] i it ’s not against his conclusion ,
m n014 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,

[ v ocalsound] you have som et hing t hat has a nice range , in your

t o t went y percent .

for inst ance ?
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ %−] : That [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg] : But [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ qy^ bu^ d^ m ^ rt ] : Robust ness m eet ing ?
m n017 [ s.%−−] : It was [ vocalsound] about half of t he r
m n017 [ fh|s] : So , [ v ocalsound] in t erm s of num ber of words , it ’s like

fe008 [ s^ ba] : t hat ’s a good point .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : y eah .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .

fe008 [ s^ ba] : Good idea .
m e011 [ %−−] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : I bet t here ’s a weak dependence .

m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e018 [ s^ na] : Cuz not everybody t alks .

Swit chboard it goes down from [ disfm arker] I don’t know [ disfm arker] f
um [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] I don’t know [ disfm arker] f fourt een
percent of t he words t o m aybe [ vocalsound] uh I don’t know , eleven
percent or som et hing [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not a dram at ic change ,
m n017 [ s.%−−] : so it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ fg] : Any way ,
m n017 [ s.%−−] : so it ’s uh [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : That was [ disfm arker] t hat was one set of [ pause] result s ,
m n017 [ s] : and t hen t he second one was just basically t he
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] t he st uff we had in t he [ disfm arker] in t he
HLT paper on how ov erlaps effect t he [ pause] recognit ion perform ance
.
fe008 [ b] : Hm m .
m e011 [ s^ ar] : Nope .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s] : And we rescored t hings um , a lit t le bit m ore carefully .
m n017 [ s] : We also fixed t he t ranscript s in [ disfm arker] in num erous
way s .
m n017 [ fh|s.%−−] : Uh , but m ost ly we added one [ disfm arker] one
num ber , which was
m n017 [ s.%−−] : what if you [ pause] uh , basically score ignoring all
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so t he [ disfm arker] t he conject ure from
t he HLT result s was t hat [ vocalsound] m ost of t he added recognit ion
error is from insert ions [ vocalsound] due t o background speech .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : So , we scored [ vocalsound] all t he recognit ion result s
, [ v ocalsound] uh , in such a way t hat t he
m n017 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qw^ rt ] : Oh by t he way , who ’s on channel four ?
m n014 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : You ’re get t ing a lot of breat h .
m e001 [ %−] : That ’s [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s] : I j was just wondering .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e001 [ s] : That ’s m e .
m n017 [ s] : uh , well Don ’s been working hard .
m e001 [ s^ aa] : That ’s right .
m n017 [ fg] : OK ,

m n017 [ s] : so [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] so if you have t he foreground
speaker speaking here , and t hen t here ’s som e background speech ,
m ay be ov erlapping it som ehow ,
m n017 [ fh|s] : um , and t his is t he t im e bin t hat we used ,
m n017 [ s] : t hen of course you ’re gonna get insert ion errors here and
here .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m n017 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m n017 [ s] : So we scored everyt hing ,
m n017 [ s] : and I m ust say t he NIST scoring t ools are pret t y nice for
t his ,
m n017 [ s] : where you just basically ignore everyt hing out side of t he ,
[ v ocalsound] uh , region t hat was deem ed t o be foreground speech .
m n017 [ s] : And where t hat was we had t o use t he t forced alignm ent ,
uh , result s from s for [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : That ’s som ewhat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s som ewhat subject t o
error ,
m n017 [ s] : but st ill we [ disfm arker] we [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] Uh ,
Don did som e ha hand − checking
m n017 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and we t hink t hat [ disfm arker] based on
t hat , we t hink t hat t he result s are you know , valid ,
m n017 [ s] : alt hough of course , som e error is gonna be in t here .
m n017 [ s] : But basically what we found is aft er we t ake out t hese
regions [ disfm arker] so we only score t he regions t hat were cert ified
as foreground speech , [ com m ent ] [ vocalsound] t he recognit ion error
went down t o alm ost [ vocalsound] uh , t he [ pause] level of t he non −
ov erlapped [ pause] speech .
m n017 [ s] : So t hat m eans t hat [ v ocalsound] even if you do have
background speech , if you can som ehow separat e out or find where it
is , [ v ocalsound] uh , t he recognizer does a good job ,
m e011 [ s^ ba] : That ’s great .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s.%−] : ev en t hough t here is t his back
m e011 [ s] : Yeah , I guess t hat doesn’t surprise m e ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : because , wit h t he close − t alking m ikes , t he
[ disfm arker] t he signal will be so m uch st ronger .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ fh] : Um ,
m n017 [ s.%−] : so [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qw^ rt ] : What [ disfm arker] what sort of norm alizat ion do you
do ?

m n017 [ h|s.%−] : Uh , well , we just [ disfm arker] @ @ [ com m ent ] we do
[ disfm arker] u y ou know , vit
m e011 [ s^ e] : I m ean in you recognizer ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : in t he SRI recognizer .
m n017 [ s] : Well , we do uh , VTL [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] vocal t ract
lengt h norm alizat ion ,
m n017 [ s] : w and we uh [ disfm arker] you know , we [ disfm arker] we uh
, [ v ocalsound] m ake all t he feat ures have zero m ean and unit variance
.
m e013 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Over an ent ire ut t erance ?
m n017 [ s^ ng] : Ov er [ disfm arker] over t he ent ire c over t he ent ire
channel .
m e011 [ qrr^ d] : Or windowed ?
m n014 [ s^ t 1.%−−] : Don’t [ pause] t rain [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−−] : Over t he [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fh] : but you know .
m e011 [ b] : Hm m .
m n017 [ s] : Um , now we didn’t re − align t he recognizer for t his .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : We just t ook t he old [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : So t his is act ually a sub − opt im al way of doing it ,
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ s] : So we t ook t he old recognit ion out put
m n017 [ s] : and we just scored it different ly .
m n017 [ s^ e.%−] : So t he recognizer didn’t have t he benefit of knowing
where t he foreground speech [ disfm arker] a st art
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Were you including t he [ disfm arker] t he lapel [ pause]
in t his ?
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m e013 [ qy^ rt ] : And did t he [ disfm arker] did [ disfm arker] did t he la did
t he [ disfm arker] t he problem s wit h t he lapel go away also ?
m n017 [ h|s^ aa] : Um , it [ disfm arker] Yeah .
m e013 [ qrr.%−−] : Or [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : fray for [ disfm arker] for insert ions ?
m n017 [ s^ aap] : It u not per [ disfm arker] I m ean , not com plet ely ,
m n017 [ s^ aa] : but yes ,
m n017 [ s^ e] : dram at ically .
m e013 [ s^ 2] : Less so .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : So we have t o
m n017 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : I m ean , you st ill [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ cc] : Well I should bring t he [ disfm arker] should bring t he
t able wit h result s .
m n017 [ s^ cs] : May be we can look at it [ pause] Monday .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : I would presum e t hat you st ill would have som ewhat
higher error wit h t he lapel for insert ions t han [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m n017 [ %−−] : It ’s [ disfm arker] It ’s [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m e013 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df.%−] : Cuz again , looking forward t o t he non − close m iked

m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : I ’m not looking forward t o it .
m e013 [ s] : i it ’s t he high signal − t o − noise rat io
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ t 3] : here t hat [ disfm arker] t hat helps you .
m n017 [ b] : u s Right .
m n017 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : so t hat was num ber [ disfm arker] t hat was t he second set
of [ disfm arker] uh , t he second sect ion .
m n017 [ s] : And t hen , [ vocalsound] t he t hird t hing was , we looked at
, [ v ocalsound] [ vocalsound] uh , what we call " int errupt s " ,
m n017 [ s^ e] : alt hough t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat m ay be [ vocalsound]
a m isnom er ,
m n017 [ s.%−−] : but basically [ vocalsound] we looked at cases where
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : Uh , so we [ disfm arker] we used t he punct uat ion from t he
original t ranscript s
m n017 [ s] : and we inferred t he beginnings and ends of sent ences .
m n017 [ fh] : So ,
m n017 [ fh] : y ou know [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ qy ] : Di − did you use upper − lower case also , or not ?
m n017 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ qw^ br^ rt ] : Hm m ?
fe008 [ s.%−] : U upper lower case or no ?
m n017 [ s^ ar] : No ,
m n017 [ s^ e^ nd] : we only used , you know , uh periods , uh , quest ion
m arks and [ pause] exclam at ion .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : And we know t hat t here ’s t h t hat ’s not a very g
m n017 [ s^ df] : I m ean , we m iss a lot of t hem ,
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s.%−] : but [ disfm arker] but it ’s f i i
fe008 [ s^ bd] : That ’s OK
fe008 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ qy ^ d] : Com m a also or not ?
m n017 [ s^ nd] : No com m as .
m n017 [ s^ ar] : No .

m n017 [ s.%−−] : And t hen [ vocalsound] we looked at locat ions where ,
m n017 [ fh] : uh ,
m n017 [ qw] : if y ou have overlapping speech and som eone else st art s
a sent ence , y ou know , where do t hese [ disfm arker] where do ot her
people st art t heir [ v ocalsound] t urns [ disfm arker] not t urns really , but
y ou know , sent ences ,
m n014 [ b] : Ah .
m n017 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : So we only looked at cases where t here was a foreground
speaker
m n017 [ s] : and t hen at t he t o at t he [ disfm arker] so t he [ disfm arker]
t he foreground speaker st art ed int o t heir sent ence and t hen som eone
else st art ed lat er .
m n017 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : OK ?
m n014 [ s^ bu] : Som ewhere in bet ween t he st art and t he end ?
m n017 [ s.%−−] : And so what [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n017 [ qw^ br^ d^ rt ] : Sorry ?
m n014 [ s^ bu^ r] : Som ewhere in bet ween t he st art and t he end of t he
foreground ?
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m n017 [ s^ e] : Uh , so t hat such t hat t here was overlap bet ween t he
t wo sent ences .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s] : So , t he [ disfm arker] t he quest ion was how can we
[ disfm arker] what can we say about t he places where t he second or
[ disfm arker] or act ually , several second speakers , [ vocalsound] um
[ pause] st art t heir [ pause] " int errupt s " , as we call t hem .
m e018 [ s^ cs^ j] : Three words from t he end .
m e011 [ s] : At pause boundaries .
m n017 [ %−] : w
m n017 [ s.%−−] : And we looked at t his in t erm s of
m n017 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ cs^ j] : On T − closures , only .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : So [ disfm arker] so we had [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound]
we had
m n017 [ fh] : um u
m n017 [ s] : t o [ disfm arker] for [ disfm arker] for t he purposes of t his
analy sis , we t agged t he word sequences , and [ disfm arker] and we
t im e − aligned t hem .
m n017 [ fh] : Um ,
m n017 [ s] : and we considered it int errupt [ disfm arker] if it occurred in
t he m iddle of a word ,
m n017 [ s^ e] : we basically [ disfm arker] you know , considered t hat t o
be a int errupt as if it were at [ disfm arker] at t he beginning of t he word
.

m n017 [ s^ e] : So t hat , [ vocalsound] if any part of t he word was
ov erlapped , it was considered an int errupt ed [ pause] word .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s] : And t hen we looked at t he [ disfm arker] t he locat io t he ,
[ v ocalsound] um , you know , t he feat ures t hat [ disfm arker] t he t ags
m n017 [ s^ df] : because we had t agged t hese word st rings ,
[ com m ent ] [ v ocalsound] um , t hat [ disfm arker] t hat occurred right
before t hese [ disfm arker] t hese uh , int errupt locat ions .
m n014 [ s.%−] : Tag by uh
m n017 [ s^ e] : And t he t ags we looked at are [ vocalsound] t he spurt
t ag ,
m n017 [ s.%−−] : which basically says [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s.%−−] : or act ually [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ fa] : Sorry .
m n017 [ s^ bsc] : End of spurt .
m n017 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] whet her t here was a pause
essent ially here ,
m n017 [ s^ df] : because spurt s are a [ disfm arker] defined as being
y ou know , fiv e hundred m illiseconds or longer pauses ,
m n017 [ s] : and t hen we had t hings like discourse m arkers ,
m n017 [ s] : uh , backchannels ,
m n017 [ s] : uh , disfluencies .
m n017 [ fh] : um ,
m n017 [ s] : uh , filled pauses [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ e] : So disfluen t he D ’s are for , [ vocalsound] um ,
[ v ocalsound] t he int errupt ion point s of a disfluency ,
m n017 [ s^ e] : so , where you hesit at e , or where you st art t he repair
t here .
m n017 [ fh|qw^ t 1] : Uh , what else do we had .
m n017 [ s^ e] : Uh , repeat ed [ disfm arker] you know , repeat ed words
is anot her of t hat kind of disfluencies and so fort h .
m n017 [ s] : So we had bot h t he beginnings and ends of t hese
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ e] : uh so , t he end of a filled pause
m n017 [ s^ e] : and t he end of a discourse m arker .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : And we just ey eballed [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : I m ean [ vocalsound] we didn’t really hand − t ag all of t hese
t hings .
m n017 [ s] : We just [ pause] looked at t he dist ribut ion of words ,
m n017 [ s] : and so every [ vocalsound] " so yeah " , and " OK " , uh ,
and " uh − huh " were [ disfm arker] were t he [ disfm arker] were deem ed
t o be backchannels
m n017 [ s] : and [ v ocalsound] " wow " and " so " and [ vocalsound] uh "
right " , uh were um [ disfm arker] [ pause] Not " right " . " Right " is a
backchannel .

m n017 [ s] : But so , we sort of [ disfm arker] just based on t he lexical
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] um , ident it y of t he words , we [ disfm arker]
we t agged t hem as one of t hese t hings .
m n017 [ s] : And of course t he d t he int errupt ion point s we got from
t he original t ranscript s .
m n017 [ fh] : So ,
m n017 [ s.%−−] : and t hen we looked at t he dist i
m n017 [ s] : so we looked at t he [ pause] dist ribut ion of t hese different
kinds of t ags , overall
m n017 [ s] : uh , and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and part icularly at
t he int errupt ion point s .
m n017 [ s] : And uh , we found t hat t here is a m arked difference
m n017 [ fh] : so
m n017 [ s.%−−] : t hat for inst ance aft er [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : so at t he end aft er a discourse m arker or aft er
backchannel or aft er filled pause , you ’re m uch m ore likely t o be
int errupt ed [ vocalsound] t han before .
m n017 [ fh] : OK ?
m n017 [ s] : And also of course aft er spurt ends ,
m n017 [ s^ e] : which m eans basically in p inside pauses .
m n017 [ s^ e.%−−] : So pauses are alway s an opport unit y for
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : So we have t his lit t le hist ogram which shows t hese
dist ribut ions
m n017 [ fh] : and , [ v ocalsound] um ,
m e018 [ s.%−] : I wonder [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ df] : y ou know , it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] it ’s not
[ disfm arker] No big surprises ,
m n017 [ s.%−] : but it is [ pause] sort of int erest ing from [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : It ’s nice t o act ually m easure it t hough .
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : I wonder about t he cause and effect t here .
m e018 [ s^ df] : In ot her words uh [ pause] if you weren’t going t o pause
y ou [ disfm arker] you will because you ’re g being int errupt ed .
m n017 [ s.%−] : Well we ’re ne
m e018 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n017 [ s^ ng] : There ’s no st at em ent about cause and effect .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah ,
m n017 [ s] : This is just a st at ist ical correlat ion ,
m e018 [ b] : right .
m e018 [ s^ ar] : No , no , no .
m e018 [ b] : Right ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : I [ disfm arker] I see .
m n017 [ fh] : yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s^ na] : But he [ disfm arker] yeah , he ’s [ disfm arker] he ’s right
,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : y I m ean m aybe
m e013 [ s] : y ou weren’t int ending t o pause at all ,
m e013 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] You were int ending t o st op
for fift y − sev en m illiseconds ,
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : but t hen Chuck cam e in
m e013 [ s] : and so y ou [ vocalsound] paused for a second
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ fg] : Anyway . [ com m ent ] So ,
m e013 [ s^ e] : or m ore .
m n017 [ s] : uh , and t hat was basically it .
m n017 [ s] : And [ disfm arker] and we [ disfm arker] so we wrot e t his
m n017 [ s] : and t hen , [ vocalsound] we found we were at six pages ,
m n017 [ s] : and t hen we st art ed [ vocalsound] cut t ing furiously
m n014 [ s^ ba] : Oops .
m n017 [ s] : and [ vocalsound] t hrew out half of t he [ vocalsound]

m n017 [ s^ ar] : No , no .
m n017 [ s^ ng] : W well , d you couldn’t really m ake everyt hing sm aller
m n017 [ s.%−−] : but we s we put [ disfm arker]

[ v ocalsound] is not readable .
m n017 [ s^ e] : It ’s only uh , accessible .

m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fh|s] : uh , and t he direct ory for t his I call it I " ASR zero point

m n017 [ s^ df] : because it ’s sort of m eant for recognit ion .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So anyone who hears t his m eet ing now knows t he
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Bet a ?
m n017 [ s] : And t hen [ disfm arker] t hen in t here I have a file t hat list s

m e011 [ s] : I uh , put digit s in m y own hom e direct ory [ disfm arker]

m n017 [ s^ bk.%] : Oh , OK .
m n017 [ b] : OK .
m e018 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : So we could point Mari t o t his also for her

m n017 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n017 [ qw^ d] : March O − one .
m n017 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Oh !

m e018 [ s.%−] : You n Rem em ber she was [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : Oh she want ed t hat also ?

m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e001 [ fg] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fg] : But yeah ,
m e001 [ %−] : I
m n017 [ s.%−−] : we can send [ disfm arker] I can CC Mari on t his so t hat
she knows [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : So , for t he t hing t hat [ disfm arker]

fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s good .
m e018 [ s] : We need t o give Brian t he beeps file ,
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s.%−] : so I was gonna probably put it [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : We can put it in t he sam e place .
m e018 [ s^ bk|s.%−] : Yeah , it
m e011 [ s] : Just put in anot her direct ory .
m n017 [ fg|s^ co] : Well , m ake ano m ake anot her direct ory .
m e018 [ s^ cc] : I ’ll m ake anot her direct ory .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : You don’t n m
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Exact ly .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m e001 [ s^ rt ] : And , Andreas , um , sam pled ?
m n017 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : They are ?
m e001 [ s^ na] : I t hink so .
m e001 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e001 [ s^ cs] : Um , so eit her we should regenerat e t he original
[ v ocalsound] versions , [ com m ent ] [ pause] or um , we should just
m ake a not e of it .
m n017 [ b] : Oh .
m n017 [ fg] : Beca − Well [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , because in one direct ory t here ’s t wo versions .
m e001 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , t hat ’s t he first m eet ing I cut bot h versions .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e001 [ s^ df] : Just t o check which w if t here is a significant difference
.
m n017 [ s.%−−] : And so I [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK
m n017 [ s^ bu] : so [ disfm arker] but for t he ot her m eet ings it ’s t he
downsam pled v ersion t hat you have .
m e001 [ s^ na] : They ’re all downsam pled ,
m e001 [ s^ aa] : yeah .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m n017 [ s] : Oh t hat ’s t h im port ant t o know ,
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK
m n017 [ fh] : so
m n017 [ s^ cs] : we should probably [ disfm arker] uh [ pause] give t hem
t he non − downsam pled versions .
m e001 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e001 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fg] : OK .

m n017 [ fg|s^ cc.%−−] : Alright , t hen I ’ll hold off on t hat and I ’ll wait for
y ou
m n017 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e001 [ s] : Probably by t om orrow
m n017 [ %−] : gen
m e001 [ s.%−−] : I can [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e001 [ s^ cc] : I ’ll send you an em ail .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Alright .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n017 [ s] : Yeah , definit ely t hey should have t he full bandwidt h
v ersion ,
m n017 [ fh.%] : yeah . OK .
m e001 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e001 [ s] : because I m ean [ disfm arker] I I t hink Liz decided t o go
ahead wit h t he [ pause] downsam pled versions cuz we can [ disfm arker]
There was no s like , r significant difference .
m n017 [ fg|s^ df] : Well , it t akes [ disfm arker] it t akes up less disk
space , for one t hing .
m e001 [ s^ m ^ na] : It does t ake up less disk space ,
m e001 [ s^ e] : and apparent ly it did even bet t er [ pause] t han t he
original [ disfm arker] t han t he original v ersions ,
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m e001 [ s^ e] : which you know , is just , probably random .
m n017 [ s] : Yeah , it was a sm all difference
m n017 [ fh] : but yeah .
m e001 [ s] : But , um [ pause] t hey probably w want t he originals .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : OK .
m n017 [ fg] : OK ,
m n017 [ s^ ba] : good .
m n017 [ s^ ba.%−−] : Good t hat [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ ba.%−] : Well , it ’s a good t hing t hat [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bu] : OK , I t hink we ’re losing , Don and Andreas at t hree −
t hirt y ,
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e001 [ s] : Hey m on haft a booga .
m e011 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ fg] : So ,
m e013 [ s] : t hat ’s why it was good t o have Andreas , say t hese t hings
m e013 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ cs^ t ^ t c.%−−] : So , we should probably t alk about t he IBM
t ranscript ion process st uff t hat [ disfm arker]

fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ h|qy^ d^ rt ] : So , um you know t hat Adam creat ed um , a b a
script t o generat e t he beep file ?
fe008 [ s^ e] : To t hen creat e som et hing t o send t o IBM .
fe008 [ fh] : And , um ,
fe008 [ s^ cs] : you [ disfm arker] you should probably t alk about t hat .
fe008 [ s] : But [ disfm arker] but you were gonna t o use t he [ pause]
originally t ranscribed file
fe008 [ s^ df] : because I t ight ened t he t im e bins
fe008 [ s^ e] : and t hat ’s also t he one t hat t hey had already
[ v ocalsound] in t rying t o debug t he first st age of t his .
fe008 [ fh] : And uh ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : m y underst anding was t hat ,
fe008 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I haven’t [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] I haven’t list ened t o it
y et ,
fe008 [ s^ ba] : but it sounded very good
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ bu] : and [ disfm arker] and I underst and t hat you guys
[ v ocalsound] were going t o have a m eet ing t oday , before t his m eet ing
.
m e011 [ s^ df] : It was just t o t alk about how t o generat e it .
m e011 [ fh|s^ e] : Um , just so t hat while I ’m gone , you can regenerat e
it if y ou decide t o do it a different way .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Ex cellent .
m e011 [ s] : So uh , Chuck and Thilo should , now m ore or less know
how t o generat e t he file
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : and , [ vocalsound] t he ot her t hing Chuck point ed out is
t hat , um , [ vocalsound] since t his one is hand − m arked , [ vocalsound]
t here are discourse boundaries .
m e011 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ e] : So [ disfm arker] so when one person is speaking , t here
’s breaks .
m e011 [ s] : Whereas Thilo ’s won’t hav e t hat .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh !
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : So what [ disfm arker] what we ’re probably gonna do is just
writ e a script , t hat if t wo , chunks are very close t o each ot her on t he
sam e channel we ’ll just m erge t hem .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Ah , int erest ing .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Oh , sure .

fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah , sure .
fe008 [ s^ na] : Makes sense .
m e011 [ fh|s] : So , uh , and t hat will get around t he problem of , t he ,
[ v ocalsound] you know " one word beep , one word beep , one word
beep , one word beep " .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Ah !
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Clev er .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Clever .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Ex cellent .
m e018 [ s] : Yeah , in fact aft er our m eet ing uh , t his m orning Thilo
cam e in and said t hat [ vocalsound] um , t here could be [ pause] ot her
differences bet ween [ vocalsound] t he uh [ pause] already t ranscribed
m eet ing wit h t he beeps in it and one t hat has [ pause] just r been run
t hrough his process .
fe008 [ s] : And t hat ’s t he purpose .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : So t om orrow , [ vocalsound] when we go t o m ake t he um
[ pause] uh , chunked file [ vocalsound] for IBM , we ’re going t o act ually
com pare t he t wo .
m e018 [ s] : So he ’s gonna run his process on t hat sam e m eet ing ,
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Great idea !
m e018 [ s] : and t hen we ’re gonna do t he beep − ify on bot h , and
list en t o t hem and see if we not ice any real differences .
m n017 [ s^ fe] : Beep − ify !
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : now one t hing t hat prevent ed us from apply you
[ disfm arker] you from applying [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Exact ly .
fe008 [ s^ m ^ na] : The t raining [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bu] : So t hat is t he t raining m eet ing .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m e018 [ s] : w and we know t hat .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e018 [ s.%−] : Wel − uh we just wanna if [ disfm arker] if t here ’re any
m ajor differences bet ween [ vocalsound] doing it on t he hand
fe008 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Oh , int erest ing .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Ah !
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ b] : Hm m .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Int erest ing idea .

m n017 [ qy .%−] : So t his t raining m eet ing , uh w un is t hat uh [ pause]
som e dat a where we have uh very um , [ vocalsound] you know ,
accurat e [ pause] t im e m arks ? for [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Great .
fe008 [ s^ na] : I went back and hand − m arked t he [ pause] ba t he bins
,
fe008 [ s] : I m ent I m ent ioned t hat last week .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n017 [ s^ bk] : yeah .
m e018 [ s] : But t he [ disfm arker] but t here ’s [ disfm arker] yeah , but
t here is t his one issue wit h t hem in t hat t here ’re [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] t here are t im e boundaries in t here t hat occur in t he
m iddle of speech .
m n017 [ s.%−] : Because [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ e.%−−] : Like when we went t t o
m e018 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ e] : When I was list ening t o t he original file t hat Adam had ,
it ’s like you [ disfm arker] you hear a word t hen you hear a beep
[ v ocalsound] and t hen you hear t he cont inuat ion of what is t he sam e

m e011 [ s] : That ’s on t he ot her channel .
m e011 [ s] : That ’s because of channel overlap .
m e018 [ fg] : Well ,
m e018 [ s.%−−] : and [ disfm arker] and so t he [ disfm arker] t h
fe008 [ b] : Hm m .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : So t here are t hese chunks t hat look like uh
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] t hat have uh [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ %−] : It ’s [ disfm arker] i
m e011 [ s] : I m ean t hat ’s not gonna be t rue of t he foreground

m e011 [ s^ e] : That ’ll only be if it ’s t he background speaker .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m e018 [ s] : So you ’ll [ disfm arker] you ’ll have a chunk of , you know ,
channel [ v ocalsound] A which st art s at zero and ends at t en ,
m e018 [ s] : and t hen t he sam e channel st art ing at eleven ,

m e018 [ s] : ending at t went y .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ,
m e018 [ s] : so t hat ’s t hree chunks where [ vocalsound] act ually we w
can just m ake one chunk out of t hat
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ e] : which is A , zero , t went y .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Sure .

m e011 [ s^ na] : That ’s what I just said ,
fe008 [ b] : Sure .
m e011 [ fh] : yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ df] : So I just want ed t o m ake sure t hat it was clear .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
fe008 [ s^ na] : I t hought t hat was [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fg|s.%−] : So [ vocalsound] if you were t o use t hese , you have
t o be careful not t o pull out t hese individual [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ fh] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh !
m n017 [ s.%−] : I m ean it [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ bk] : Right ,
m n017 [ s] : I m ean w I m ean what I would [ disfm arker] I was int erest ed
in is hav ing [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] a se having t im e m arks for t he
beginnings and ends of speech
m n017 [ s^ e] : by each speaker .
m e011 [ s^ nd] : Well , t hat ’s definit ely a problem .
m n017 [ s^ df] : Uh , because we could use t hat t o fine t une our
alignm ent process
m n017 [ s^ e] : t o m ake it m ore accurat e .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ t 3] : Bat t ery .
m n014 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ m ^ rt ^ t 3] : Bat t ery ?
m e018 [ s^ aa^ t 3] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fh] : uh ,
m n017 [ s] : it [ disfm arker] I don’t care t hat you know , t here ’s act ually
abut t ing segm ent s t hat we have t o join t oget her .
m n017 [ s] : That ’s fine .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : But what we do care about is t hat [ vocalsound] t he
beginnings and ends um [ pause] are act ually close t o t he speech
[ v ocalsound] inside of t hat
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n017 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : I t hink Jane t ight ened t hese up by hand .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
m n014 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n017 [ qw] : so what is t he [ disfm arker] sort of how t ight are t hey ?
m e013 [ s^ ba^ t 3] : Uh , it looks m uch bet t er .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ ba] : Looks good .
fe008 [ s] : They were , um , reasonably t ight , but not excruciat ingly
t ight .

m n017 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
fe008 [ s^ df] : That would ’ve t aken m ore t im e .
fe008 [ s^ df.%−] : I just want ed t o get it so t ha So t hat if you have like "
y eah " [ com m ent ] in a [ disfm arker] swim m ing in a big bin , t hen it ’s
[ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fg] : No , no !
m n017 [ s.%−−] : I don
m n017 [ s.%−−] : act ually I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ co^ t 3] : Let m e m ake a not e on yours .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] it ’s f
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ na] : That ’s fine
m n017 [ s^ df.%−−] : because we don’t want t o [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ na^ r] : t h t hat ’s perfect ly fine .
m n017 [ s^ ba] : In fact it ’s good .
m n017 [ s^ df^ na] : You always want t o have a lit t le bit of pause or
nonspeech around t he speech , say for recognit ion purposes .
m n017 [ fh] : Uh ,
m n017 [ s] : but just [ disfm arker] just u w you know get an id I just
want ed t o hav e an idea of t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] of how m uch
ex t ra y ou allowed
m n017 [ fh] : um [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ df] : so t hat I can int erpret t he num bers if I com pared t hat
wit h a forced alignm ent segm ent at ion .
m n017 [ fh] : So .
fe008 [ s^ no] : I can’t answer t hat ,
fe008 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] but m y m ain goal was [ pause] um , in
t hese areas where y ou have a t hree − way overlap [ vocalsound] and
one of t he overlaps involves " yeah " , [ vocalsound] and it ’s swim m ing
in t his huge bin , [ v ocalsound] I want ed t o get it so t hat it was clo
m ore closely localized .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m n017 [ qy^ rt ] : But are we t alking about , I don’t know , [ pause] a
[ v ocalsound] [ pause] t ent h of a second ?
m n017 [ %−−] : a [ disfm arker] ?
m n017 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : You know ?
m n017 [ qw^ bu] : How [ disfm arker] how m uch [ disfm arker] how m uch
ex t ra would you allow at m ost [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I [ disfm arker] I want ed t o [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I want ed it t o be able t o [ disfm arker] l he be heard norm ally
,
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .

fe008 [ s^ e] : so t hat if you [ disfm arker] if y ou play [ pause] back t hat
bin and have it in t he m ode where it st ops at t he boundary ,
[ v ocalsound] it sounds like a norm al word .
m n017 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ e] : It doesn’t sound like t he person [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ e] : i it sounds norm al .
fe008 [ s^ e] : It ’s as if t he person could ’ve st opped t here .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ e] : And it wouldn’t have been an awkward place t o st op .
fe008 [ s] : Now som et im es you know , it ’s [ disfm arker] t hese are
inv olv ed in places where t here was no t im e .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And so , [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] t here wouldn’t be
[ pause] a gap aft erwards because [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : I m ean som e cases , t here ’re som e people [ pause] um ,
who [ disfm arker] who have very long [ pause] segm ent s of discourse
where , [ v ocalsound] you know , t hey ’ll [ disfm arker] t hey ’ll breat h
[ pause] and t hen I put a break .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : But ot her t han t hat , it ’s really pret t y cont inuous
fe008 [ s^ e] : and t his includes t hings like going from one sent ence
int o t he [ disfm arker] u one ut t erance int o t he next , one sent ence int o
t he nex t ,
fe008 [ fh] : um ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : w wit hout really st opping .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I m ean [ disfm arker] i t hey , i
fe008 [ s] : you know in writ ing you have t his [ vocalsound] t wo spaces
and a big gap
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : you know .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : But [ disfm arker] but uh [ pause] [ vocalsound] i som e
people are planning
fe008 [ s] : and , y ou know , I m ean , a lot [ disfm arker] we always are
planning [ pause] what we ’re going t o say next .
m n017 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : But uh , in which case , t he gap bet ween [ pause] t hese t wo
com plet e sy nt act ic unit s , [ vocalsound] um , which of course n spoken
t hings are not always com plet e sy nt act ically ,
fe008 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] but it would be a short er p
short er break [ v ocalsound] t han [ vocalsound] m aybe you m ight like .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : But t he goal t here was t o [ pause] not have [ vocalsound]
t he t ex t be so [ disfm arker] so crudely [ pause] parsed in a t im e bin .

fe008 [ s^ df.%−−] : I m ean , because [ vocalsound] from a discourse m
purpose [ pause] it ’s [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] it ’s m ore [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] it ’s m ore useful t o be able t o see [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : and also you know , from a speech recognit ion purpose m y
im pression is t hat [ vocalsound] if you have t oo long a unit , it ’s
[ disfm arker] it doesn’t help you very m uch eit her ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : cuz of t he m em ory .
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Well , yeah .
m n017 [ s^ na] : That ’s fine .
fe008 [ s] : So , t hat m eans t hat [ vocalsound] t he am ount of t im e aft er
som et hing is variable depending part ly on cont ext ,
fe008 [ s] : but m y general goal [ v ocalsound] when t here was [ pause]
sufficient space , room , pause [ pause] aft er it [ pause] t o have it be
[ pause] kind of a nat ural feeling [ pause] gap .
m n017 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ no] : Which I c I don’t know what it would be quant ified as .
fe008 [ s] : You know , Wally Chafe say s t hat [ vocalsound] um ,
[ v ocalsound] in producing narrat ives , t he spurt s t hat people use
[ v ocalsound] t end t o be , [ vocalsound] uh , t hat t he [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] what would be a pause m ight be som et hing like t wo
[ disfm arker] t wo seconds .
m n017 [ b] : Mm m .
fe008 [ s^ e] : And um , t hat would be , you know one speaker .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : The discourse [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t he people who
look at t urn t aking oft en do use [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : I was int erest ed t hat you chose uh , [ vocalsound] you know
um , [ com m ent ] t he [ disfm arker] you know t hat you use
fe008 [ s^ df] : cuz I t hink t hat ’s a unit t hat would be m ore consist ent
wit h sociolinguist ics .
m n017 [ s] : Well we chose um , you know , half a second
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ s^ df] : because [ vocalsound] if [ disfm arker] if you go m uch
larger , y ou hav e a [ disfm arker] y y ou know , your [ disfm arker] your
st at em ent about how m uch overlap t here is becom es less ,
[ v ocalsound] um , precise ,
m n017 [ s^ df] : because you include m ore of act ual pause t im e int o
what y ou consider overlap speech .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ fh] : Um ,
m n017 [ fh] : so ,
m n017 [ s] : it ’s sort of a com prom ise ,
m n017 [ s.%−−] : and [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] it ’s also based
[ disfm arker]

m n014 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah . [ com m ent ] [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] Yeah , I
also used I t hink som et hing around zero point five seconds for t he
speech − nonspeech det ect or [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s^ e] : I m ean Liz suggest ed t hat value based on [ vocalsound]
t he dist ribut ion of pause t im es t hat you see in Swit chboard and
[ disfm arker] and ot her corpora .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ e] : for t he m inim um silence lengt h .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n014 [ fh] : So .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : In any case , t his [ disfm arker] t his uh , m eet ing [ pause]
t hat I hand [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I hand − adjust ed t wo of t hem
fe008 [ s] : I m ent ioned before ,
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s^ bk] : OK ,
fe008 [ s] : and I sent [ disfm arker] I sent em ail ,
m n017 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so at som e point we will t ry t o fine − t une
our forced alignm ent
fe008 [ fh] : so [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : And I sent t he [ com m ent ] [ pause] pat h .
m n017 [ s^ am ^ e] : m aybe using t hose as references
m n017 [ s] : because you know , what you would do is y ou would play
wit h different param et ers .
m n017 [ s] : And t o get an object You need an object ive [ vocalsound]
m easure of how closely you can align t he m odels t o t he act ual speech
.
m n017 [ s] : And t hat ’s where your y our dat a would be [ pause] very
im port ant t o have .
m n017 [ s.%−−] : So , I will [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s] : Yeah and hopefully t he new m eet ings [ pause] which will
st art from t he channelized version will [ disfm arker] will have bet t er t im e
boundaries [ pause] and alignm ent s .
m n017 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n017 [ s^ aa] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : But I like t his idea of [ disfm arker] uh , for our purposes for
t he [ disfm arker] for t he IBM preparat ion , [ vocalsound] uh , n having
t hese [ pause] joined t oget her ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .

fe008 [ fh] : and uh [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : It m akes a lot of sense .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : And in t erm s of t ranscript ion , it would be easy t o do it
t hat way .
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ e] : The way t hat t hey have wit h t he longer unit s ,
m n017 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ e] : not having t o fuss wit h adding t hese unit s at t his t im e .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n017 [ b] : Right .
m n014 [ s^ rt ] : Whi − which could hav e one drawback . If t here is uh a
backchannel in bet ween t hose t hree t hings ,
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ s^ e] : t he [ disfm arker] t he n t he backchannel will [ disfm arker]
will occur at t he end of [ disfm arker] of t hose t hree .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yes .
m n014 [ s^ e] : And [ disfm arker] and in [ disfm arker] in t he [ disfm arker]
in t he previous version where in t he n which is used now , [ vocalsound]
t here , t he backchannel would [ disfm arker] would be in − bet ween
t here som ewhere ,
fe008 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m n014 [ fh] : so .
fe008 [ fg] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s] : That would be m ore nat ural
fe008 [ fg] : Well ,
m n014 [ %−] : but [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ aa] : t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s right ,
fe008 [ s] : but you know , t hi t his brings m e t o t he ot her f st age of t his
which I discussed wit h you earlier t oday ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : which is [ vocalsound] t he second st age is [ vocalsound] um
, w what t o do [ pause] in t erm s of t he t ranscribers adjust m ent of
t hese dat a .
fe008 [ s] : I discussed t his wit h you t oo .
fe008 [ fh|s.%−−] : Um , t he t r
fe008 [ s] : so t he idea init ially was , we would get [ vocalsound] uh , for
t he new m eet ings ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : so t he e EDU m eet ings , t hat [ vocalsound] Thilo ha has
now presegm ent ed all of t hem for us , on a channel by channel basis .
fe008 [ fh] : And um ,
fe008 [ s] : so , I ’v e assigned [ disfm arker] I ’ve [ disfm arker] I ’ve
assigned t hem t o our t ranscribers
fe008 [ fh] : and um ,
fe008 [ s] : so far I ’v e discussed it wit h one ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : wit h uh [ disfm arker]

fe008 [ s] : And I had a [ pause] about an hour discussion wit h her
about t his y est erday ,
fe008 [ s] : we went t hrough [ vocalsound] uh EDU − one , at som e
ex t ent .
fe008 [ s] : And it occurred t o m e t hat [ v ocalsound] um [ disfm arker]
t hat [ v ocalsound] basically what we have in t his kind of a form at is
[ disfm arker] you could consider it as a st aggered m ixed file ,
fe008 [ s] : we had som e discussion over t he weekend a about
[ disfm arker] at [ disfm arker] at t his ot her m eet ing t hat we were all a at
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ fh|s^ e] : um , [ vocalsound] about whet her t he t ran t he IBM
t ranscribers should hear a single channel audio , or a m ixed channel
audio .
fe008 [ fh|s] : And um , [ vocalsound] in [ disfm arker] in a way , by
[ disfm arker] by hav ing t his [ disfm arker] t his chunk and t hen t he
backchannel [ vocalsound] aft er it , it ’s like a st agal st aggered m ixed
channel .
fe008 [ fh|s.%−−] : And um , [ vocalsound] it occurred [ pause] t o m e in
m y discussion wit h her yest erday t hat um ,
fe008 [ fh] : um ,
fe008 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] [ pause] t he [ disfm arker] t he m axim al gain ,
it ’s [ disfm arker] from t he IBM [ pause] people , m ay be in long
st ret ches of connect ed speech .
fe008 [ s^ df] : So it ’s basically a whole bunch of words [ vocalsound]
which t hey can really do , because of t he cont inuit y wit hin t hat person
’s t urn .
fe008 [ fh|s^ cs] : So , what I ’m t hinking , and it m ay be t hat not all
m eet ings will be good for t his , [ com m ent ] but [ disfm arker] but what I
’m t hinking is t hat [ vocalsound] in t he EDU m eet ings , t hey t end t o be
[ v ocalsound] driv en by a couple of dom inant speakers .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : And , if t he chunked files focused on t he dom inant
speakers , [ v ocalsound] t hen , when [ disfm arker] when it got s
pat ched t oget her when it com es back from IBM , we can add t he
backchannels .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : It seem s t o m e [ v ocalsound] t hat [ vocalsound] um , you
know , t he backchannels per − se wouldn’t be so hard ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : but t hen t here ’s t his quest ion of t he t im e [ pause] @ @
[ com m ent ] uh , m arking , and whet her t he beeps would be
[ v ocalsound] uh y y y
fe008 [ s^ no] : And I ’m not exact ly sure how t hat [ disfm arker] how t hat
would work wit h t he [ disfm arker] wit h t he backchannels .
fe008 [ fh] : And ,
fe008 [ fh] : so um [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : And cert ainly t hings t hat are [ vocalsound] int rusions of
m ult iple words , [ v ocalsound] t aken out of cont ext and displaced in
t im e from where t hey occurred , [ vocalsound] t hat would be hard .

fe008 [ s] : So , m m y [ vocalsound] t hought is [ pause] i I ’m having t his
t ranscriber go t hrough [ vocalsound] t he EDU − one m eet ing , and
indicat e a st art t im e [ nonvocalsound] f for each dom inant speaker ,
endpoi end t im e for each dom inant speaker ,
fe008 [ s] : and t he idea t hat [ vocalsound] t hese unit s would be
generat ed for t he dom inant speakers , [ vocalsound] and m aybe not
for t he ot her channels .
m e011 [ s^ ng] : Yeah t he only , um , disadvant age of t hat is , t hen it ’s
hard t o use an aut om at ic m et hod t o do t hat .
m e011 [ s^ na] : The advant age is t hat it ’s probably fast er t o do t hat
t han it is t o use t he aut om at ed m et hod and correct it .
m e011 [ fh] : So .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well , it [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s] : We ’ll just have t o see .
fe008 [ s] : I t hink [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] I [ disfm arker] I t hink um ,
y ou know , t he original plan was t hat t he t ranscriber would adjust t he t
t he boundaries , and all t hat for all t he channels
fe008 [ s] : but , [ v ocalsound] you know , t hat is so t im e − consum ing ,
fe008 [ s^ df] : and since we have a bot t leneck here , we want t o get
IBM t hings t hat are usable s as soon as possible ,
fe008 [ s^ df] : t hen t his seem ed t o m e it ’d be a way of get t t o get
t hem a flood of dat a ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : which would be useful when it com es back t o us .
fe008 [ fh] : And um [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : Oh also , at t he sam e t im e she [ disfm arker] when she goes
t hrough t his , she ’ll be [ vocalsound] uh [ disfm arker] If t here ’s
anyt hing t hat [ vocalsound] was encoded as a pause , but really has
som et hing t ranscribable in it , [ v ocalsound] t hen she ’s going t o
[ v ocalsound] uh , m ake a m ark [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ fg] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ e] : w uh , so you know , so [ vocalsound] t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat bin would be m arked as it [ disfm arker] as double dot s
fe008 [ s^ e] : and she ’ll just add an S .
fe008 [ s^ e] : And in t he ot her [ disfm arker] in t he ot her case , if it ’s
m arked as speech , [ vocalsound] and really t here ’s not hing
t ranscribable in it , t hen she ’s going t o put a s dash ,
fe008 [ s^ cc] : and I ’ll go t hrough and it [ disfm arker] and um , you
know , wit h a [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound] wit h a
subst it ut ion com m and , get it so t hat it ’s clear t hat t hose are t he
ot her cat egory .
fe008 [ s^ cc] : I ’ll just , you know , recode t hem .
fe008 [ fh|s] : But um , [ vocalsound] um , t he t ranscribable event s
[ pause] t hat um , I ’m considering in t his , [ vocalsound] uh , cont inue
t o be [ vocalsound] laugh , as well as speech , and cough and t hings
like t hat ,

fe008 [ s] : so I ’m not st ripping out anyt hing ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : just [ disfm arker] just you know , being very lenient in
what ’s considered speech .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ rt ] : Jane ?
fe008 [ qw^ d] : Yeah ?
m e018 [ qw.%−−] : In t erm s of t he [ disfm arker] t his new procedure you
’re suggest ing , [ vocalsound] um , u what is t he [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ t 3] : It ’s not t hat different .
m e018 [ s] : So I ’m a lit t le confused ,
m e018 [ qw^ bu^ rt ] : because how do we know where t o put beeps ?
m e018 [ qy .%−] : Is it [ disfm arker] i d y is it [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
fe008 [ s] : So what it [ disfm arker] what it [ disfm arker] what it involves
is [ disfm arker] is really a s uh , [ vocalsound] uh , t he original pr
procedure ,
m e011 [ s] : Transcriber will do it .
fe008 [ s^ e] : but [ vocalsound] only applied t o [ pause] uh , a cert ain
[ pause] st rat egically chosen [ pause] s aspect of t he dat a .
m e011 [ s] : We pick t he easy part s of t he dat a basically ,
fe008 [ %−] : So [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : and t ranscriber m arks it by hand .
fe008 [ s^ na] : You got it .
m e011 [ s.%−] : And because [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ bu] : But aft er we ’ve done Thilo ’s t hing .
m e011 [ s^ ar] : No .
fe008 [ s^ ar] : Yes !
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh , aft er .
fe008 [ s^ ar^ r] : Yes !
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK ,
fe008 [ s^ aa^ fe] : Oh yeah !
m e011 [ s^ df] : I didn’t [ disfm arker] I didn’t underst and t hat .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n014 [ fg] : So ,
m n014 [ s] : I ’m @ @ [ disfm arker] now I ’m confused .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : We st art wit h your presegm ent ed version [ disfm arker]
m n017 [ s] : OK , and I ’m leaving .
m e001 [ s] : Yeah , I have t o go as well .
m n017 [ fh] : So , um [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ co] : OK , leave t he m ikes on ,
m e011 [ s^ co] : and just put t hem on t he t able .
m e001 [ s^ aa] : OK .
m e001 [ s^ ft ] : Thanks .
fe008 [ s] : We st art wit h t he presegm ent ed version [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ co^ t 3] : Let m e m ark you as no digit s .
m n014 [ s^ bu] : You st art wit h t he presegm ent at ion ,

m n014 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : r [ vocalsound] y eah ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : And t hen um , [ vocalsound] t he t ranscriber , [ vocalsound]
inst ead of going painst akingly t hrough all t he channels and m oving t he
boundaries around , and deciding if it ’s speech or not , but not
t ranscribing anyt hing .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK ?
fe008 [ s] : Inst ead of doing t hat , which was our original plan ,
[ v ocalsound] t he t ra They focus on t he dom inant speaker [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s] : They just [ vocalsound] do t hat on [ pause] t he m ain
channels .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : So what t hey do is t hey ident ify who ’s t he di dom inant
speaker , and when t he speaker st art s .
m e018 [ b] : OK .
m n014 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : Yeah ?
m n014 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So I m ean , you ’re st ill gonna [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So we ’re [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s.%−] : And you just [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : It ’s based on your se presegm ent at ion ,
fe008 [ s] : t hat ’s t he basic [ pause] t hing .
m n014 [ qy^ d^ rt ] : and you just use t he s t he segm ent s of t he
dom inant speaker t hen ? For [ disfm arker] for sending t o [ disfm arker]
t o IBM
m n014 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Ex act ly .
m e018 [ qy^ rt ] : So , now Jane , m y quest ion is [ vocalsound] when t hey
’re all done adjust ing t he w t im e boundaries for t he dom inant speaker
, [ com m ent ] hav e t hey t hen also erased t he t im e boundaries for t he
ot her ones ?
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ ar] : Uh No . No , no .
m e018 [ qw.%−] : So how will we know who [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ar] : Huh − uh .
fe008 [ %−] : S
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ df] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s why she ’s not at ing t he st art
and end point s of t he dom inant speakers .
fe008 [ s^ e] : So , on a [ disfm arker] you know , so [ vocalsound] i in
EDU − one , i as far as I list ened t o it , you st art off wit h a [ disfm arker] a
s sect ion by Jerry .
fe008 [ s^ e] : So Jerry st art s at m inut e so − and − so ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : and goes unt il m inut e so − and − so .

fe008 [ s^ e] : And t hen Mark Paskin com es in .
fe008 [ s^ e] : And he st art s at [ vocalsound] m inut e such − and − such ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : and goes on t ill m inut e so − and − so .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : And t hen [ vocalsound] m eanwhile , she ’s list ening t o
[ v ocalsound] [ pause] bot h of t hese guys ’ channels ,
fe008 [ s] : det erm ining if t here ’re any cases of m isclassificat ion of
speech as not hing , and not hing as speech ,
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s] : and [ vocalsound] a and adding a t ag if t hat happens .
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : So she does t he adjust m ent s on t hose guys ?
fe008 [ s] : But y ou know , I want ed t o say , his segm ent at ion is so
good , t hat [ v ocalsound] um , t he part t hat I list ened t o wit h her
y est erday [ v ocalsound] didn’t need any adjust m ent s of t he bins .
m n014 [ s^ 2] : On t hat m eet ing .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : So far we haven’t .
fe008 [ s] : So t his is not gonna be a m ajor part of t he process ,
fe008 [ s^ e.%−] : at least [ disfm arker] least not in [ disfm arker] not on
ones t hat [ disfm arker] t hat really [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ qh^ cs] : So if you don’t hav e t o adjust t he bins , why not just
do what it [ disfm arker] for all t he channels ?
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m ?
m e018 [ qh^ cs] : Why not just t hrow all t he channels t o IBM ?
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well t here ’s t he quest ion o of [ pause] whet her
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ h] : Well , OK .
fe008 [ s] : She i It ’s a quest ion of how m uch t im e we want our
t ranscriber t o inv est here [ vocalsound] when she ’s gonna have t o
inv est t hat when it com es back from IBM anyway .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ qy ] : So if it ’s only insert ing " m m − hm m " s here and t here ,
t hen , wouldn’t t hat be som et hing t hat would be just as efficient t o do
at t his end , inst ead of having it go t hrough I B M , t hen be pat ched
t oget her , t hen be double checked here .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ %] : But [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ cs^ ng] : But t hen we could just use t he [ disfm arker] t he
out put of t he det ect or , and do t he beeping on it , and send it t o I B
m e018 [ s^ 2] : Wit hout having her check anyt hing .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well , I guess [ disfm arker]

m n014 [ s.%−] : For som e m eet ings , I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m sure it
[ disfm arker] i
m e011 [ s^ cs] : I t hink we just [ disfm arker] we just have t o list en t o it
and see how good t hey are .
m n014 [ %] : n
fe008 [ s^ na] : I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m open t o t hat ,
fe008 [ s.%−] : it was [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa|s] : Yeah , if it ’s working well ,
m e013 [ s^ ba] : t hat sounds like a good idea
m n014 [ s] : That ’s [ disfm arker] And som e [ disfm arker] on som e
m eet ings it ’s good .
m e013 [ s^ df] : since as you say you hav e t o do st uff wit h t he ot her
end anyway .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ fg] : Well yea
fe008 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : OK , good .
m e018 [ s^ na] : Yeah , I m ean we hav e t o fix it when it com es back
anyhow .
fe008 [ s.%−] : I m ean t he det ect or , t his [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bu] : Now , you were saying t hat t hey [ disfm arker] t hey differ
in how well t hey work depending on channel s sys syst em s and st uff .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ cs] : So we should perhaps just select m eet ings on which
t he speech − nonspeech det ect ion works well ,
fe008 [ s^ ba] : But EDU is great .
m n014 [ s^ cs] : and just use , [ v ocalsound] t hose m eet ings t o
[ disfm arker] t o [ disfm arker] t o send t o IBM and , do t he ot her ones .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Release t o begin wit h .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : How int erest ing .
m e013 [ s] : What ’s t he problem [ disfm arker] t he l I forget .
fe008 [ s.%−] : You know [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ] : Is t he problem t he lapel ,
m e013 [ qrr.%−−] : or [ disfm arker] or [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ h|s^ aap] : Uh , it really depends .
m n014 [ s^ aap^ rt ] : Um , m y [ disfm arker] m y [ disfm arker] m y
im pression is t hat it ’s bet t er for m eet ings wit h fewer speakers ,
m n014 [ s^ aap^ j] : and it ’s bet t er for [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] for
m eet ings where nobody is breat hing .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh ,
m e013 [ s^ j] : t he dead m eet ings .
m n014 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n014 [ %] : get [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ aa] : That ’s it .
m e018 [ s] : So in fact t his m ight suggest an alt ernat ive sort of a
[ disfm arker] a c a hybrid bet ween t hese t wo t hings .

m e011 [ s^ j^ nd^ t 3] : No , t he undead m eet ing ,
m e011 [ fh] : y eah .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ qy^ bh] : Yeah ?
m e018 [ s^ cs] : So t he [ disfm arker] t he one suggest ion is you know we
[ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] we run Thilo ’s t hing
m e018 [ s^ cs] : and t hen we have som ebody go and adjust all t he t im e
boundaries
fe008 [ qy^ bh] : Yeah ?
m e018 [ s^ cs] : and we send it t o IBM .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : The ot her one is [ v ocalsound] we just run his t hing and
send it t o IBM .
m e018 [ s] : There ’s a [ disfm arker] a anot her possibilit y if we find t hat
t here are som e problem s ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : and t hat is [ vocalsound] if we go ahead and we
[ v ocalsound] just run his , and we generat e t he beeps file , t hen we
have som ebody list en beeps file .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ cs.%−−] : And t hey list en t o each sect ion and say " yes , no "
whet her t hat sect ion is
m n014 [ s^ 2] : And erase [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ 2] : Is int elligible .
m e018 [ s^ m ^ na] : i i int elligible or not .
m e018 [ s^ df] : And it just [ disfm arker] You know , t here ’s a lit t le

t hen t hat will be t he final [ vocalsound] beep file .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Blech .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s int erest ing !
fe008 [ s^ df] : Cuz t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s direct ly relat ed t o t he e

m e011 [ s^ 2] : St ress t est .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ ba^ fe] : How int erest ing !
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : I m ean it wouldn’t be t hat m uch fun for a t ranscriber t o sit

m n014 [ s^ aa] : Nope .
m e013 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I don’t know .
m e018 [ s^ df] : But it would be quick .
m e013 [ s^ aap] : It would be [ disfm arker] kind of quick

m e013 [ s^ ng] : but t hey ’re st ill list ening t o everyt hing .
m e018 [ s^ df] : But t here ’s no adjust ing .
m e018 [ s^ df] : And t hat ’s what ’s slow .
m e018 [ s^ df^ r] : There ’s no adjust ing of t im e boundaries .
fe008 [ s^ nd] : Well , [ vocalsound] eh , list ening does t ake t im e t oo .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .

m e013 [ qw] : I m ean , [ vocalsound] what ’s t he worst t hat happens ?
m e013 [ qy .%−−] : Do t he t ranscribers [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean as long as t h on t he ot her end t hey can say t here
’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s som et hing [ disfm arker] convent ions so t hat
t hey say " huh ? "
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : and t hen we can flag t hose lat er .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : They [ disfm arker] t hey [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ s.%−] : just [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : How int erest ing !
m e011 [ s.%−] : I m ean it just depends on how [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−] : Well EDU [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah ,
m n014 [ %] : u u u
m e011 [ s^ fa|s^ cs] : Sorry , go ahead .
fe008 [ s] : So I was gonna say , EDU − one is good enough ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : m ay be we could include it in t his [ disfm arker] in t his set
of uh , t his st uff we send .
m n014 [ s^ bk|s^ aap] : Yeah t here ’s [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I t hink
t here are som e m eet ings where it would [ disfm arker] would
[ disfm arker] It ’s possible like t his .
m e011 [ s^ ng] : Yeah I [ disfm arker] I t hink , we won’t know unt il we
generat e a bunch of beep files aut om at ically , list en t o t hem and see
how bad t hey are .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .

m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ arp^ rt ] : We won’t be able t o s include it wit h t his first t hing
,
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ b] : Hm m .
m e011 [ %−] : If [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e018 [ s^ df] : because t here ’s a part of t he process of t he beep file
which requires knowing t he norm alizat ion coefficient s .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see .
m e018 [ s.%−] : And [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] So a
m e011 [ s^ nd] : That ’s not hard t o do .
m e011 [ s^ df] : Just [ disfm arker] it t akes [ disfm arker] you know , it just
t akes fiv e m inut es rat her t han , t aking a second .
m e018 [ %−] : OK
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Right ,
m e018 [ s^ df^ ng] : except I don’t t hink t hat [ disfm arker] t he c t he
inst ruct ions for doing t hat was in t hat direct ory ,
m e011 [ s] : So . I just hand [ disfm arker] hard − coded it .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e018 [ s.%−] : I [ disfm arker] I didn’t see where you had gener
m e011 [ s^ ar|s^ df] : No , but it ’s easy enough t o do .
m n014 [ %−] : What [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−] : But I [ disfm arker] but I have a [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ nd] : Doing t he gain ? It ’s no problem .
m e018 [ %−] : n Doing t h
m n014 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Adjust ing t he gain ?
m e018 [ s^ ar|s^ nd] : No , get t ing t he coefficient s ,
m e018 [ s^ e] : for each channel .
fe008 [ s] : Know what num bers .
m n014 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah , t hat ’s no problem .
m e018 [ fg] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ bu.%−] : So we just run t hat one [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s] : We can do t hat .
m e011 [ s] : There are lot s of way s t o do it .
m e011 [ s] : I have one program t hat ’ll do it .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : You can find ot her program s .
m n014 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I used it ,
m e018 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : We just run t hat
m n014 [ fh] : so .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : J − sound − st at ? OK .

m e011 [ s] : Minus D , capit al D .
m e013 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] but I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I have
[ pause] anot her suggest ion on t hat , which is , [ vocalsound] since ,
really what t his is , is [ disfm arker] is [ disfm arker] is t rying t o in t he
large , send t he right t hing t o t hem and t here is gonna be t his
[ disfm arker] t his post − processing st ep ,
m e013 [ fh] : um ,
m e013 [ qh^ cs] : why don’t we check t hrough a bunch of t hings by

m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−] : In ot her words , rat her t han , um , uh , saying we ’re
gonna list en t o ev eryt hing [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ng] : I didn’t m ean list en t o everyt hing ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : I m eant , just see if t hey ’re any good .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : So y you do a bunch of m eet ings ,
m e013 [ s^ cs] : y ou list en t o [ disfm arker] t o a lit t le bit here and t here ,
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : if it sounds like it ’s alm ost always right and t here ’s
not any big problem you send it t o t hem .
m e018 [ s^ 2] : Send it t o t hem .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : And , y ou know , t hen t hey ’ll send us back what we
[ disfm arker] w what [ disfm arker] what t hey send back t o us ,
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Oh , t hat ’d be great .
m e013 [ s] : and we ’ll [ disfm arker] we ’ll fix t hings up
m e013 [ s^ e] : and [ vocalsound] som e m eet ings will cost m ore t im e t o
fix up t han ot hers .
m e011 [ s^ cs.%−] : We should [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : And we should just double − check wit h Brian on a few

m e018 [ b] : OK .
m n014 [ b] : Sure .
m e018 [ s^ cs^ na] : When t hey [ disfm arker] when t here ’s eit her no

m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ cs^ na] : or [ vocalsound] som et hing t hey don’t underst and ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ cs^ na] : t hings like t hat .

fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ na] : Yeah , cuz @ @ uh what I had originally said t o
Brian was well t hey ’ll have t o m ark , when t hey can’t dist inguish
bet ween t he foreground and background ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : because I t hought t hat was gonna be t he m ost

m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : But if we send t hem wit hout edit ing , t hen we ’re also
gonna haft a hav e m uh , not at ions for words t hat are cut off ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ e] : and ot her sort s of , uh , acoust ic problem s .
m e018 [ s] : And t hey m ay just guess at what t hose cut − off words are ,
fe008 [ s] : They do already .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s] : but w I m ean we ’re gonna adjust [ disfm arker] everyt hing
when we com e back [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : But what [ disfm arker] what we would like t hem t o do is be
conserv at ive
m e011 [ s^ cs] : so t hat t hey should only writ e down t he t ranscript if
t hey ’re sure .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : And ot herwise t hey should m ark it so t hat we can
check .
m n014 [ s^ 2] : Mark it .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Sure .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : Well , we have t he unint elligibilit y [ pause] convent ion .
fe008 [ s] : And act ually t hey have one also ,

fe008 [ qw.%−] : Was is it in a [ disfm arker] in a [ disfm arker] what
[ disfm arker] what is t he t
m e013 [ s] : Well he ’s saying , y ou know , t hat t he [ disfm arker] t he EDU
m eet ing was a good [ disfm arker] good m eet ing ,
fe008 [ s^ bu] : In a good m eet ing ,
fe008 [ qw.%−] : what ?
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g] : right ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , and so [ disfm arker] so [ disfm arker] so it was alm ost
[ disfm arker] it was alm ost always doing t he right t hing .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh I see ,
fe008 [ s] : t he charact erist ics .
m e013 [ s] : So I want ed t o get som e sense of what [ disfm arker] what
alm ost always m eant .
m e013 [ s] : And t hen , uh in a bad m eet ing , [ vocalsound] or p som e
m eet ings where he said oh he ’s had som e problem s , what does t hat
m ean ?
fe008 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ qy^ rt ] : So I m ean does one of t he does it m ean one percent
and t en percent ?
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ qrr^ rt ] : Or does it m ean [ vocalsound] five percent and fift y
percent ?
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ fh] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ e] : Or [ disfm arker] Maybe percent age isn’t t he right word ,

m e013 [ s^ e] : but you know how m any [ disfm arker] how m any per
m inut e ,
m n014 [ fg|%−] : Yeah t h
m e013 [ fh] : or [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : You know .
m n014 [ fg] : Yeah ,
m n014 [ s] : t he [ disfm arker] t he problem is t hat , nnn , t he num bers
Ian gav e in t he paper is just uh , som e fram e error rat e .
m n014 [ s] : So t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s not really [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] What will be effect ive for [ disfm arker] for t he t ranscribers
, is [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ rt ] : They have t o [ disfm arker] yeah , in in t hey have t o
insure t hat t hat ’s a real s spurt or som et hing .

m n014 [ s.%−−] : And [ disfm arker] but , [ v ocalsound] t he num bers
[ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ fe] : Oops .
m n014 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Hm m !
m n014 [ s^ t 1] : Let m e t hink .
m n014 [ s^ e] : So t he [ pause] speech [ disfm arker] t he am ount of
speech t hat is m issed by t he [ pause] det ect or , for a good m eet ing , I
t h is around [ pause] or under one percent , I would say .
m n014 [ s.%−−] : But t here can be [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n014 [ %−−] : For [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ bk] : y eah ,
m n014 [ s.%−−] : but t here can be m ore [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s] : There ’s [ disfm arker] There ’s m ore am ount speech
[ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ e.%−−] : uh , m ore am ount of [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s] : Yeah well , t he det ect or say s t here is speech ,
m n014 [ s] : but t here is none .
m n014 [ s] : So t hat [ disfm arker] t hat can be a lot when [ disfm arker]
when it ’s really a breat hy channel .
m e013 [ s^ nd] : But I t hink t hat ’s less of a problem .
m e013 [ s] : They ’ll just list en .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s just wast ed t im e .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : And t h and t hat ’s for a good m eet ing .
m e013 [ qo] : Now what about in a m eet ing t hat you said we ’ve
[ disfm arker] you ’v e had som e m ore t rouble wit h ?
m n014 [ s^ no] : I can’t [ com m ent ] really [ disfm arker] hhh , [ com m ent ]
[ pause] Tsk . [ com m ent ] I [ pause] don’t have really represent at ive
num bers , I t hink .
m n014 [ s.%−−] : That ’s really [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ e] : I [ disfm arker] I did [ pause] t his on [ disfm arker] on four
m eet ings and only five m inut es of [ disfm arker] of every m eet of
[ disfm arker] of t hese m eet ings
m n014 [ s] : so , [ v ocalsound] it ’s not [ disfm arker] not t hat
represent at iv e ,
m n014 [ %−−] : but ,
m n014 [ s.%−−] : it ’s perhaps ,
m n014 [ x ] : Fff .
m n014 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ e] : Yeah , it ’s perhaps t hen [ disfm arker] it ’s perhaps five
percent of som et hing ,
m n014 [ s^ e] : which s uh t he [ disfm arker] t he fram es [ disfm arker]
speech fram es which are [ disfm arker] which are m issed ,

m n014 [ s] : but um , I can’t [ disfm arker] can’t really t ell .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : So I [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] So i Som et im e , we
m ight wanna go back and look at it m ore in t erm s of [ vocalsound] how
m any t im es is t here a spurt t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s uh , int errupt ed
?
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : Som et hing like t hat ?
fe008 [ s] : The ot her problem is , t hat when it [ disfm arker] when it uh d
i on t he breat hy ones , where you get [ vocalsound] [ vocalsound]
breat hing , uh , int i indicat ed as speech .
m e013 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ cs.%−−] : And I guess we could just indicat e t o t he
t ranscribers not t o [ pause] encode t hat if t hey [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ cs] : We could st ill do t he beep file .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ ng] : Yeah again I [ disfm arker] I t hink t hat t hat is
probably less of a problem
m e013 [ s^ df] : because if you ’re [ disfm arker] if t here ’s [ disfm arker]
[ v ocalsound] If [ disfm arker] if a [ disfm arker] if a word is [ disfm arker] is
split , t hen t hey m ight have t o list en t o it a few t im es t o really
underst and t hat t hey can’t quit e get it .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ df] : Whereas if t hey list en [ nonvocalsound] t o it and t here
’s [ disfm arker] don’t hear any speech I t hink t hey ’d probably just list en
t o it once .
m n014 [ fg] : But [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ e] : So t here ’d [ disfm arker] you ’d t hink t here ’d be a
[ disfm arker] a fact or of t hree or four in [ disfm arker] in , uh , cost
funct ion ,
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ e] : y ou know , bet ween t hem or som et hing .
m n014 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ,
m n014 [ s^ nd] : so [ disfm arker] but I t hink t hat ’s [ disfm arker] n t hat
really doesn’t happen very oft en t hat [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat a word is cut in t he m iddle or som et hing .
m n014 [ s^ nd] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s really not [ disfm arker] not
norm al .

m e013 [ s^ bu] : So [ disfm arker] so what you ’re saying is t hat nearly
always what happens when t here ’s a problem is t hat [ disfm arker] is
t hat uh , t here ’s [ vocalsound] som e uh , uh nonspeech t hat uh
[ disfm arker] t hat is b int erpret ed as speech .
m n014 [ s^ 2] : That is m arked as speech .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Well t hen , we really should just send t he st uff .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That would be great .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ f^ g^ rt ] : Right ?
m e013 [ s^ df] : Because t hat doesn’t do any harm .
m n014 [ fg] : Yeah ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : You know , if t hey [ disfm arker] t hey hear you know , a
dog bark and t hey say what was t he word ,
m n014 [ %−] : it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : t hey [ com m ent ] y ou know , t hey [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ fg|%−] : Yeah , I als I [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ fe^ j] : Ruff ruff !
m n014 [ s^ bk|s] : Yeah I also t hought of [ disfm arker] t here
[ disfm arker] t here are really som e channels where it is alm ost
[ com m ent ] um , only bre breat hing in it .
m e013 [ qy^ bh^ rt ] : Yeah ?
m n014 [ s.%−−] : And t o [ disfm arker] t o re − run ’s
m n014 [ fh|s^ rt ] : Eh , um . Yeah . I ’v e got a [ disfm arker] a [ pause] P −
a [ pause] m et hod wit h loops int o t he cross − correlat ion wit h t he PZM

m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m n014 [ s] : and t hen t o reject ev ery t hing which [ disfm arker] which
seem s t o be breat h .
m n014 [ s^ cs^ rt ] : So , I could run t his on t hose breat hy channels ,
m n014 [ s^ cs.%−] : and perhaps t hrow out [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ ba^ na] : That ’s a good idea .
fe008 [ s^ ba^ na] : Wow , t hat ’s a great idea .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ na] : But I t hink [ disfm arker] I t h Again , I t hink t hat sort of
[ disfm arker] t hat t hat would be good ,
m e013 [ s^ na] : and what t hat ’ll do is just cut t he t im e a lit t le furt her .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : But I t hink none of t his is st uff t hat really needs som ebody
doing t hese [ disfm arker] t hese uh , uh , explicit m arkings .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Ex cellent .
fe008 [ s^ na] : Oh , I ’d be delight ed wit h t hat ,

fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh y eah ,
fe008 [ s^ na] : I pr I m uch prefer t his ,
fe008 [ s^ na.%−−] : I was just t ry ing t o find a way [ disfm arker]

m e018 [ b] : Right .
m n014 [ s^ na] : That won’t be good .
m e018 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ na] : Yeah t hat would be very good .

which I r [ v ocalsound] we covered when I [ disfm arker] when I r list ened
t o one of t he EDU m eet ings ,
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Great .
m n014 [ s^ e] : and t hat ’s [ vocalsound] t hat som ebody is playing
sound from his lapt op .
m e011 [ b] : Uh − huh
m n014 [ s] : And i [ vocalsound] t he speech − nonspeech det ect or just
assigns random ly t he speech t o [ disfm arker] t o one of t he channels ,
m n014 [ fh] : so .
m n014 [ s] : Uh − I hav en’t − I didn’t t hink of [ disfm arker] of s of
[ v ocalsound] t his before ,
m e011 [ qw] : What can you do ?
m n014 [ qw^ rt ] : but what [ disfm arker] what shall we do about s t hings
like t his ?
fe008 [ s] : Well you were suggest ing [ disfm arker] You suggest ed
m ay be just not sending t hat part of t he m eet ing .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yep . Mm m .
fe008 [ %−−] : But [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ fg] : But ,
m n014 [ s] : som et im es t he [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] t he [ disfm arker]
t he lapt op is in t he background
m n014 [ s] : and som e [ disfm arker] som ebody is [ disfm arker] is t alking
,

m n014 [ s^ rt ] : and , [ vocalsound] t hat ’s really a lit t le bit confusing ,
m n014 [ %−−] : but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ng] : That ’s life .
m e011 [ s^ na] : It ’s a lit t le bit confusing .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ qh] : I m ean , [ com m ent ] what ’re we gonna do ?
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ df.%−−] : Even a hand − t ranscript ion would [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ qy .%−] : Do you [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bsc^ df] : a hand − t ranscriber would have t rouble wit h t hat .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
m n014 [ s] : t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a second quest ion ,
m e011 [ fh] : So .
m n014 [ qw^ rt ] : " what [ disfm arker] what will different t ranscribers do
wit h [ disfm arker] wit h t he lapt op sound ? "
m e013 [ qw] : What was t he l what was t he lapt op sound ?
fe008 [ qy .%−] : Would you [ disfm arker] would [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ co] : Yeah , go ahead .
m e013 [ qy^ e^ rt ] : I m ean was it speech ,
m e013 [ qrr.%−] : or was it [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ na] : It ’s speech .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Great .
fe008 [ fg] : Well ,
fe008 [ fg] : so [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ fg] : I m ean [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : So m y st andard approach has been if it ’s not som eone
close − m iked , t hen , t hey don’t end up on one of t he close − m iked
channels .
fe008 [ s^ e] : They end up on a different channel .
fe008 [ s^ e] : And we have any num ber of channels available ,
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
fe008 [ s^ e] : I m ean it ’s an infinit e num ber of channels .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : So just put t hem on som e ot her channel .
m n014 [ fg] : But ,
m n014 [ s^ no.%−−] : when t hi when t his is sent t o [ disfm arker] t o t he I
M − eh , I B M t ranscribers , I don’t know if [ disfm arker] if t hey can t ell
t hat ’s really [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah ,
fe008 [ s^ aa] : t hat ’s right .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ df] : Yeah cuz t here will be no channel on which it is
foreground .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .

m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : Well , t hey have a conv ent ion , in t heir own procedures ,
[ v ocalsound] which is for a background [ pause] sound .
m e011 [ fg] : Uh [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ nd] : Right , but , uh , in general I don’t t hink we want
t hem t ranscribing t he background ,
m e011 [ s^ df^ nd] : cuz t hat would be t oo m uch work .
m e011 [ b.%] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right ?
m e011 [ %−−] : For it [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ df.%−] : because in t he ov erlap sect ions , t hen t hey ’ll
m e018 [ s^ ng] : Well I don’t t hink Jane ’s saying t hey ’re gonna
t ranscribe it ,
m e018 [ s^ bu] : but t hey ’ll just m ark it as being [ disfm arker] t here ’s
som e background st uff t here ,
m e011 [ s^ nd] : But t hat ’s gonna be all over t he place .
m e018 [ qy ^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ qw^ df] : How w how will t hey t ell t he difference bet ween t hat

m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ cs^ nd] : Oh , I t hink [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’d be easy t o t o say
" background lapt op " .
m e018 [ s^ co] : But wait a m inut e ,
m e011 [ qw^ nd] : How would t hey know t hat ?
m e018 [ qw^ bu] : why would t hey t reat t hem different ly ?
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−] : Well because one of t hem [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Because ot herwise it ’s gonna be t oo m uch work for t hem
t o m ark it .
m e011 [ s^ e] : They ’ll be m arking it all over t he place .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ bk.%−−] : Oh , I s
