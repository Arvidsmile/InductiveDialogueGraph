m n005 [ z] : One , t wo , t hree , four , f
m e013 [ z] : OK .
m e011 [ z] : We didn’t crash [ disfm arker] we ’re not crashing anym ore
m e011 [ z] : and it really bot hers m e .
m e018 [ z] : I do .
m e013 [ z] : Yeah ?
m n005 [ z] : No crashing .
m e018 [ z] : I crashed when I st art ed t his m orning .
m e011 [ z] : You crashed [ disfm arker] crashed t his m orning ?
m n005 [ z] : Yeah ?
m e011 [ z] : I did not crash t his m orning .
m e013 [ z] : Oh !
m e013 [ z] : Well m aybe it ’s just , you know , how m any t u u u u how
m any t im es y ou crash in a day .
m e018 [ z] : Really ?
m e018 [ z] : Yeah .
m e018 [ z] : Maybe , yeah .
m e013 [ z] : First t im e [ disfm arker] first t im e in t he day ,
m e013 [ z] : y ou know .
m e018 [ z] : Or m ay be it ’s once y ou ’ve [ pause] done enough m eet ings
[ com m ent ] it won’t crash on you any m ore .
m n014 [ z] : Yeah .
m n005 [ z] : No ?
fe008 [ z] : Yeah .
m e018 [ z] : It ’s a m at t er of ex perience .
m n014 [ z] : Yeah .
m e013 [ z] : Yeah .

m e013 [ z] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s great .
m e018 [ z] : Yeah .
m n005 [ z] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fg] : Uh .
m e013 [ qy^ t ^ t c] : Do we have an agenda ?
m e013 [ s] : Liz [ disfm arker] Liz and Andreas can’t sh can’t [ disfm arker]
uh , can’t com e .
m e011 [ s^ na] : I do .
m e013 [ s] : So , t hey won’t be here .
m e011 [ s^ r] : I have agenda
m e018 [ %−] : Did [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : and it ’s all m e .
m e011 [ s^ df] : Cuz no one sent m e anyt hing else .
m e018 [ qy ^ rt ] : Did t hey send , uh , t he m essages t o you about t he
m eet ing t oday ?

m e011 [ s^ no] : I have no idea
m e011 [ s^ df] : but I just got it a few m inut es ago .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e018 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e011 [ s^ e] : Right when you were in m y office it arrived .
m e018 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , cuz I checked m y m ail . I didn’t have anyt hing .
m e011 [ qy ] : So , does anyone have any a agenda it em s ot her t han
me ?
m e011 [ s] : I act ually have one m ore also which is t o t alk about t he
digit s .
m e013 [ h|s^ na] : Uh , right , so [ disfm arker] so I [ disfm arker] I was just
gonna t alk briefly about t he NSF ITR .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m . Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : Oh , great .
m e013 [ h] : Uh ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and t hen , you hav e [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ %−] : Can w
m e013 [ s^ bd] : I m ean , I won’t say m uch ,
m e013 [ qy ^ bu^ d] : but [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] uh , but t hen , uh ,
y ou said [ disfm arker] wanna t alk about digit s ?
m e011 [ s^ na] : I have a short t hing about digit s
m e011 [ s] : and t hen uh I wanna t alk a lit t le bit about nam ing
conv ent ions ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : alt hough it ’s unclear whet her t his is t he right place t o
t alk about it .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : So m aybe just t alk about it very briefly
m e011 [ s^ e] : and t ake t he det ails t o t he people who [ disfm arker] for
whom it ’s relevant .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Right .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : I could always say som et hing about t ranscript ion .
fe008 [ %−−] : I ’ve been [ disfm arker] [ v ocalsound] but [ disfm arker] but
[ disfm arker] uh , well [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ng] : Well if we [ disfm arker] Yeah , we shouldn’t add t hings
in just t o add t hings in .
m e013 [ s^ df] : I ’m act ually pret t y busy t oday ,
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : so if we can [ disfm arker] [ com m ent ] [ vocalsound]
we [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
m e013 [ s^ cs] : a short m eet ing would be fine .
fe008 [ s^ na] : This does sound like we ’re doing fine ,
fe008 [ b] : yeah .
fe008 [ s] : That won’t do .
m e011 [ s^ t ^ t c] : So t he only t hing I wanna say about digit s is , we are
pret t y m uch done wit h t he first t est set .

m e011 [ s] : There are probably form s here and t here t hat are m arked
as hav ing been read t hat weren’t really read .
m e011 [ s] : So I won’t really know unt il I go t hrough all t he t ranscriber
form s
m e011 [ s] : and ext ract out pieces t hat are in error .
m e011 [ s] : So I wa Uh . Two t hings .
m e011 [ qw] : The first is what should we do about digit s t hat were
m isread ?
m e011 [ s^ cs] : My opinion is , um , we should just t hrow t hem out
com plet ely ,
m e011 [ s^ cs^ e] : and have t hem read again by som eone else .
m e011 [ s] : You know , t he grouping is com plet ely random ,
m n005 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e011 [ s] : so it [ disfm arker] it ’s perfect ly fine t o put a [ disfm arker] a
group t oget her again
m e011 [ s^ e] : of errors
m e011 [ s^ cs.%−−] : and have t hem re − read ,
m e011 [ s] : just t o finish out t he t est set .
fe008 [ s^ bk|qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Oh ! By [ disfm arker] t hrow t hem out
com plet ely ?
m e011 [ s^ cs] : Um , t he ot her t hing you could do is change t he
t ranscript t o m at ch what t hey really said .
m e011 [ s] : So t hose are [ disfm arker] t hose are t he t wo opt ions .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : But t here ’s oft en t hings where people do false st art s .
m e013 [ s^ df.%−] : I know I ’ve done it , where I say [ disfm arker] say a
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : What t he t ranscribers did wit h t hat is if t hey did a
correct ion , and t hey event ually did read t he right st ring , [ com m ent ]
y ou ex t ract t he right st ring .
m e018 [ s^ bu] : Oh , you ’re t alking about where t hey com plet ely read
t he wrong st ring and didn’t correct it ?
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ e] : Yeah . And didn’t not ice .
m e018 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Ah .
m n014 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ e] : Which happens in a few places .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ fg|s] : Well , and s and y ou ’re t alking st ring − wise ,
m e011 [ fg] : So [ disfm arker] so [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bu] : y ou ’re not t alking about t he ent ire page ?
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Correct .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : I get it .

m e011 [ s^ rt ] : And so t he [ disfm arker] t he t wo opt ions are change t he
t ranscript t o m at ch what t hey really said ,
m e011 [ s^ df] : but t hen [ disfm arker] but t hen t he t ranscript isn’t t he
Aurora t est set any m ore .
m e011 [ s] : I don’t t hink t hat really m at t ers
m e011 [ s^ df] : because t he condit ions are so different .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : And t hat would be a lit t le easier .
m e018 [ qw] : Well how m any are [ disfm arker] how [ disfm arker] how
oft en does t hat happen ?
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : Mm m , five or six t im es .
m e018 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : Oh , so it ’s not very m uch .
m e011 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : No , it ’s not m uch at all .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : Seem s like we should just change t he t ranscript s
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e018 [ s^ e] : t o m at ch .
m e013 [ fg|qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Yeah , it ’s five or six t im es out of [ pause]
t housands ?
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ bc] : Four t housand .
m n005 [ s^ bc] : Four t hous Ah ! Four t housand .
m e013 [ qh^ bk] : Four t housand ?
m e018 [ b] : Yeah ,
m e018 [ %−−] : it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fg|s^ cs] : Yeah , I would , uh , [ vocalsound] t ak do t he easy
way ,
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ba.%−] : It [ disfm arker] it ’s kinda nice [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Mm m .
m e013 [ qh] : I m ean , wh who knows what st udies people will be doing
on [ disfm arker] on speaker − dependent t hings
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : and so I t hink having [ disfm arker] having it all
[ disfm arker]
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : t he speakers who we had is [ disfm arker] is at least
int erest ing .
m e018 [ fg|qw] : So you [ disfm arker] um , how m any digit s have been
t ranscribed now ?
m e011 [ s] : Four t housand lines .
m e011 [ s] : And each line is bet ween one and about t en digit s .
m e018 [ qh^ bk^ d] : Four t housand lines ?
m e011 [ s] : I didn’t [ disfm arker] I didn’t com put e t he average .
m e011 [ s] : I t hink t he average was around four or five .

m e013 [ s] : So t hat ’s a couple hours of [ disfm arker] of , uh , speech ,
probably .
m e018 [ s^ ba] : Wow .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : Which is a yeah reasonable [ disfm arker] reasonable
t est set .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s] : And , Jane , I do have a set of form s which I t hink you have
copies of som ewhere .
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m . Yeah , t rue .
m e011 [ s^ bk|qy^ bu^ d] : Oh you do ?
fe008 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m . Mm − hm m .
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : Oh OK , good , good .
m e011 [ s^ df.%−−] : Yeah , I was just wond
m e011 [ s] : I t hought I had [ disfm arker] had all of t hem back from you .
fe008 [ s^ ar|s^ na] : No , not yet .
m e011 [ s] : And t hen t he ot her t hing is t hat , uh , t he form s in front of
us here t hat we ’re gonna read lat er , were suggest ed by Liz
m e011 [ s^ df] : because she want ed t o elicit som e different prosodics
from digit s .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e011 [ s^ co] : And so , uh , I just want ed people t o , t ake a quick look
at t he inst ruct ions
m n014 [ s.%] : Eight eight t wo t wo t wo nine .
m e011 [ s] : and t he way it wa worked and see if it m akes sense
m e011 [ s] : and if any one has any com m ent s on it .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : And t he decision here , uh , was t o cont inue wit h uh
t he words rat her t han t he [ disfm arker] t he num erics .
m e011 [ h|s^ aa^ rt ] : Uh , yes ,
m e011 [ s^ cs] : alt hough we could swit ch it back .
m e011 [ s] : The problem was O and zero .
m e011 [ s^ cs] : Alt hough we could swit ch it back and t ell t hem always
t o say " zero " or always t o say " O " .
fe008 [ s^ bk.%] : Oh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ cs] : Or neit her .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bu] : But it ’s just t wo t hing [ disfm arker] ways t hat you can
say it .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : Right ?
fe008 [ b] : Oh .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Sure .

m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker] um ,
m e013 [ s] : t hat ’s t he only t hought I have
m e013 [ s^ df.%−−] : because if y ou t st art t alking about t hese , you
know u t r
m e013 [ s] : She ’s t rying t o get at nat ural groupings ,
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Right .
m e013 [ s] : but it [ disfm arker] t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s not hing
nat ural about reading num bers t his way .
m e013 [ s^ df^ e] : I m ean if you saw a t elephone num ber you would
never see it t his way .
m e011 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he problem also is she did want t o st ick
wit h digit s .
m e011 [ s^ df] : I m ean I ’m speaking for her since she ’s not here .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : But , um , t he ot her problem we were t hinking about is if
y ou just put t he num erals , [ com m ent ] t hey m ight say fort y − t hree
inst ead of four t hree .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ bk^ fe] : Mm m .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Well , if t here ’s space , t hough , bet ween t hem .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , you can [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : Wit h [ disfm arker] when you space t hem out t hey don’t look
like , uh , fort y − t hree anym ore .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Well , she and I were t alking about it ,
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : and she felt t hat it ’s v ery , very nat ural t o do t hat sort of
chunking .
m e013 [ s^ na|s^ ba] : She ’s right . It ’s [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it ’s
a different problem .
m e013 [ s] : I m ean it ’s a [ disfm arker] it ’s a [ disfm arker] it ’s an
int erest ing problem [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : I m ean , we ’ve done st uff wit h num bers before ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and yeah som et im es people [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : If you say s " t hree nine eight one " som et im es people will
say " t hirt y − nine eight y − one "
m e013 [ s] : or " t hree hundred [ disfm arker] t hree hundred eight y −
nine one " ,
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bd] : or [ disfm arker] I don’t t hink t hey ’d say t hat ,
m e013 [ fh] : but [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ na] : Not very frequent ly

m e013 [ %−] : but t h
m e013 [ s^ aa] : no [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ df] : but , [ vocalsound] t hey cert ainly could .
m e013 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , t h t hirt y − eight ninet y − one is probably how t hey ’d do
it .
m e011 [ fg|s] : So . I m ean , t his is som et hing t hat Liz and I spoke about
m e013 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ cs] : and , since t his was som et hing t hat Liz asked for
specifically , I t hink we need t o defer t o her .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : OK . Well , we ’re probably gonna be collect ing
m eet ings for a while
m e013 [ s] : and if we decide we st ill wanna do som e digit s lat er we
m ight be able t o do som e different ver different versions ,
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Do som et hing different ,
m e011 [ b] : yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bd] : but t his is t he next suggest ion ,
m e013 [ fh] : so .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ fg|s^ t ^ t c] : OK , so uh e l I guess , let m e , uh , get m y
[ disfm arker] m y short t hing out about t he NSF .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I sent t his [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : act ually t his is m aybe a lit t le side t hing .
m e013 [ s] : Um , I [ disfm arker] I sent t o what I t hought we had , uh , in
som e previous m ail , as t he right joint t hing t o send t o ,
m e011 [ s] : It was .
m e013 [ s] : which was " M [ disfm arker] MTG RCDR hyphen joint " .
m e011 [ s^ 2] : Joint .
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e013 [ s.%−] : But t hen I got som e sort of funny m ail saying t hat t he
m oderat or was going t o [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ %−] : It ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e011 [ s] : That ’s because t hey set t he one up at UW [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : t hat ’s not on our side , t hat ’s on t he U − dub [ com m ent ]
side .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh .
m e011 [ s] : And so U − UW set it up as a m oderat ed list .
fe008 [ b.%] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Oh , OK .
m e011 [ s^ no] : And , I have no idea whet her it act ually ever goes t o
anyone

m e011 [ s^ cs] : so y ou m ight just wanna m ail t o Mari
m e013 [ s^ ar|s^ df] : No [ disfm arker] no , t h I got [ disfm arker] I got , uh
, lit t le ex cit ed not es from Mari and Jeff and so on ,
m e011 [ %−] : and [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : OK , good .
m e013 [ %−−] : so it ’s [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : So t he m oderat or act ually did repost it .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s] : Cuz I had sent one earlier [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : Act ually t he sam e t hing happened t o m e [ disfm arker] I had
sent one earlier .
m e011 [ s:s] : The m essage say s , " You ’ll be inform ed "
m e011 [ s] : and t hen I was never inform ed
m e011 [ s] : but I got replies from people indicat ing t hat t hey had
got t en it ,
m e011 [ fh] : so .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e011 [ s] : It ’s just t o prevent spam .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e013 [ fg|s^ t c] : Yeah so O [ disfm arker] OK . Well , anyway , I guess
[ disfm arker] everybody here [ disfm arker] Are y are [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu] : y ou are on t hat list ,
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So you got t he not e ?
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : Yeah ? OK .
m e013 [ fh] : Um ,
m e013 [ s] : so t his was , uh , a , uh , proposal t hat we put in
m e013 [ s^ e] : before on [ disfm arker] on m ore [ disfm arker] m ore
higher level , uh , issues in m eet ings ,
m e013 [ s^ bd] : from [ disfm arker] I guess higher level from m y point of
v iew .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , [ vocalsound] and , uh , m eet ing m appings ,
m e013 [ fh] : and , uh [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : so is i for [ disfm arker] it was a [ vocalsound] proposal for
t he ITR program ,
m e013 [ s] : uh , Inform at ion Technology Research program ’s part of
Nat ional Science Foundat ion .
m e013 [ s] : It ’s t he [ pause] second year of t heir doing , uh , t hese
grant s .
m e013 [ %−−] : They ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : a lot of t hem are [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : som e of t hem anyway , are larger [ disfm arker] larger
grant s t han t he usual , sm all NSF grant s ,

m e013 [ fh] : and .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : So , t hey ’re very com pet it ive ,
m e013 [ s] : and t hey have a first phase where you put in pre −
proposals ,
m e013 [ s] : and we [ disfm arker] we , uh , got t hrough t hat .
m e013 [ s] : And so t h t he [ disfm arker] t he next phase will be
[ disfm arker] we ’ll act ually be doing a larger proposal .
m e013 [ s] : And I ’m [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I hope t o be doing very
lit t le of it .
m e013 [ fh] : And [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : uh , [ v ocalsound] which was also t rue for t he pre −
proposal ,
m e013 [ fh] : so .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , t here ’ll be bunch of people working on it .
m e013 [ fh] : So .
m e011 [ qw^ rt ] : When ’s [ disfm arker] when ’s t he full proposal due ?
m e013 [ s] : Uh , I t hink April nint h , or som et hing .
m e013 [ s] : So it ’s about a m ont h .
m n014 [ %−] : p s
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Yep .
m e013 [ fh] : Um [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ rt ] : And t hey said end of business day you could check on
t he reviewer form s ,
m e018 [ %−] : u
m e018 [ s] : Tom orrow .
m e011 [ qy.%−] : is t hat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : Tom orrow .
m n014 [ s] : Tom orrow ?
m e013 [ s] : March second , I said .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ s] : Tom orrow .
m e011 [ s] : I ’ve been a day off all week .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : I guess t hat ’s a good t hing
m e011 [ s^ df] : cuz t hat way I got m y papers done early .
m e018 [ s.%−] : It would be int erest ing [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ ba^ fe] : So t hat ’s am azing y ou showed up at t his m eet ing !
m e011 [ s^ na] : It is . It is act ually quit e am azing .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .

m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean we got [ vocalsound] [ disfm arker] we have
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : yeah , t wo of t hem are [ disfm arker] t wo in t he c There
’re [ pause] t wo in t he class already here ,

m e013 [ %−−] : and t hen [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and , uh [ disfm arker] uh ,
m e013 [ s] : t hen t here ’s a t hird who ’s doing a project here ,
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s^ bd] : who , uh [ disfm arker] But he [ disfm arker] he
[ disfm arker] he won’t be in t he count ry t hat long ,
m e013 [ fh] : and ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : m aybe anot her will end up .
m e011 [ b] : Yep .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Act ually t here is one ot her guy who ’s looking
[ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat ’s t hat
m e013 [ %−−] : guy , uh ,
m e013 [ s^ rt ] : Jerem y ? [ com m ent ] I t hink .
m n005 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ b] : [ no m at ched cont ent ]
m e013 [ fg|s] : Anyway , yeah t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s all I was gonna
say is t hat [ disfm arker] t hat t hat ’s [ disfm arker] you know , t hat ’s nice
m e013 [ s] : and we ’re sort a preceding t o t he next st ep ,
m e013 [ s] : and , [ vocalsound] it ’ll m ean som e m ore work , uh , you
know , in [ disfm arker] in March in get t ing t he proposal out ,
m e013 [ s] : and t hen , it ’s , uh , you know [ disfm arker] We ’ll see what
happens .
m e013 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : Uh , t he last one was [ disfm arker] t hat
y ou had t here , [ com m ent ] was about nam ing ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e011 [ s] : It just , uh [ disfm arker] we ’v e been cut t ing up sound files ,
in [ disfm arker] for ba bot h digit s and for , uh , doing recognit ion .
m e011 [ s] : And Liz had som e suggest ions on nam ing
m e011 [ s] : and it just brought up t he whole issue t hat hasn’t really
been resolved about nam ing .
m e011 [ s] : So , uh , one t hing she would like t o have is for all t he
nam es t o be t he sam e lengt h
m e011 [ s^ df] : so t hat sort ing is easier .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fh] : Um ,
m e011 [ s^ e] : sam e num ber of charact ers
m e011 [ s^ df] : so t hat when you ’re sort ing filenam es you can easily
ex t ract out bit s and pieces t hat y ou want .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : And t hat ’s easy enough t o do .
m e011 [ s] : And I don’t t hink we have so m any m eet ings t hat t hat ’s a
big deal just t o change t he nam es .
m e011 [ s] : So t hat m eans , uh , inst ead of calling it " MR one " , " MR
t wo " , y ou ’d call it " MRM zero zero one " ,
m e011 [ s] : " MRM zero zero t wo " , t hings like t hat .
m e011 [ s] : Just so t hat t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re all t he sam e
lengt h .

fe008 [ s.%−−] : But , you know , when y ou , do t hings like t hat you can
always [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ df.%−−] : as long as you have [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : uh , y ou can always search from t he beginning or t he end of
t he st ring .
fe008 [ s.%−] : You know , so " zero zero t wo " [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : The problem is t hat t hey ’re a lot of fields .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m e011 [ s^ f] : Alright ,
m e011 [ s^ df^ e] : so we [ disfm arker] we have t h we ’re gonna have
t he speaker ID ,
m e011 [ s] : t he session ,
m e011 [ fh] : uh [ disfm arker] uh ,
fe008 [ s^ bk|s^ ba.%−] : Yeah , well , your exam ple was really
[ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s] : inform at ion on t he m icrophones ,
fe008 [ %−] : i
m n005 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e011 [ s] : inform at ion on t he speak on t he channels and all t hat .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : And so if each one of t hose is a fixed lengt h , t he
sort ing becom es a lot easier .
m e001 [ s^ rt ] : She want ed t o keep t hem [ vocalsound] t he sam e
lengt hs across different m eet ings also .
m e001 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ rt ] : So like , t he NSA m eet ing lengt hs , [ com m ent ]
all filenam es are gonna be t he sam e lengt h as t he Meet ing Recorder
m eet ing nam es ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : And as I said , t he it ’s [ disfm arker] we just don’t have
t hat m any t hat t hat ’s a big deal .
m e018 [ qy^ bu^ d^ rt ] : Cuz of digit s .
m e011 [ s^ cs.%−−] : And so , uh , um , at som e point we have t o sort of
t ake a few days off ,
m e011 [ s^ cs^ e] : let t he t ranscribers have a few days off ,
m e011 [ s^ cs^ e] : m ake sure no one ’s t ouching t he dat a
m e011 [ s^ cs^ e] : and reorganize t he file st ruct ures .
m e011 [ s] : And when we do t hat we can also rat ionalize som e of t he
nam ing .
fe008 [ s^ ng] : I [ disfm arker] I would t hink t hough t hat t he t ranscribe
[ disfm arker] t he t ranscript s t hem selves wouldn’t need t o have such
lengt hy nam es .
fe008 [ s] : So , I m ean , you ’re dealing wit h a different dom ain t here ,
and wit h st art and end t im es and all t hat ,
m e011 [ s^ bk] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : and channels and st uff ,
fe008 [ s] : so , it ’s a different [ pause] set .

m e011 [ fg|s] : Right . So t he only t hing t hat would change wit h t hat is
just t he direct ory nam es ,
m e011 [ s] : I would change t hem t o m at ch .
m e011 [ s] : So inst ead of being MR one it would be MRM zero zero one
.
m e011 [ s^ ba] : But I don’t t hink t hat ’s a big deal .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Fine . Fine .
m e011 [ s] : So for [ disfm arker] for m t he m eet ings we were t hinking
about t hree let t ers and t hree num bers
m e011 [ s] : for m eet ing I Ds .
m e011 [ s] : Uh , for speakers , M or F and t hen t hree num bers ,
m e011 [ fh] : For , uh [ disfm arker] and , uh ,
m e011 [ s^ cs] : t hat also brings up t he point t hat we have t o st art
assem bling a speaker dat abase so t hat we get t hose links back and
fort h
m e011 [ s] : and keep it consist ent .
m e011 [ fh] : Um ,
m e011 [ s] : and t hen , uh , t he m icrophone issues .
m e011 [ s] : We want som e way of specifying , m ore t han looking in t he
" key " file , what channel and what m ike . What channel , what m ike ,
and what broadcast er .
m e011 [ s^ df^ no] : Or [ disfm arker] I don’t know how t o s say it .
m e011 [ s] : So I m ean wit h t his one it ’s t his part icular headset wit h
t his part icular t ransm it t er w [ pause] as a wireless .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ b] : Yep .
m e011 [ s] : And y ou know t hat one is a different headset and different
channel .
m e011 [ s] : And so we just need som e nam ing convent ions on t hat .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e011 [ fh] : And , uh ,
m n005 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e011 [ s^ ba] : t hat ’s gonna becom e especially im port ant once we
st art changing t he m icrophone set − up .
m e011 [ s] : We have som e new m icrophones t hat I ’d like t o st art
t ry ing out ,
m e011 [ fh] : um ,
m e011 [ s] : once I t est t hem .
m e011 [ s] : And t hen we ’ll [ disfm arker] we ’ll need t o specify t hat
som ewhere .
m e011 [ s] : So I was just gonna do a fix ed list of , uh , m icrophones
and t y pes .
m n005 [ s^ bk] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e011 [ s.%−] : So , as I said [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ ba] : That sounds good .

m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh|qw^ t ^ t c] : Um , [ pause] [ vocalsound] since we have such a
short agenda list I guess I wi I will ask how [ disfm arker] how are t he
t ranscript ions going ?
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : The [ disfm arker] t he news is t hat I ’ve [ disfm arker] I uh
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ %−−] : s So [ disfm arker] in s um [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So I ’v e swit ched t o [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : St art m y new sent ence .
fe008 [ s] : I [ disfm arker] I swit ched t o doing t he channel − by − channel
t ranscript ions t o prov ide , uh , t he [ disfm arker] uh , t ight er t im e bins
for [ disfm arker] part ly for use in Thilo ’s work
fe008 [ s] : and also it ’s of relevance t o ot her people in t he project .
fe008 [ s] : And , um , I discovered in t he process a couple of
[ disfm arker] of int erest ing t hings ,
fe008 [ %−−] : which , um ,
fe008 [ s] : one of t hem is t hat , um , it seem s t hat t here are t im e lags
inv olv ed in doing t his ,
fe008 [ fh] : uh , uh ,
fe008 [ s] : using an int erface t hat has so m uch m ore com plexit y t o it .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : And I [ disfm arker] and I want ed t o m aybe ask , uh ,
Chuck t o help m e wit h som e of t he quest ions of efficiency .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : Maybe [ disfm arker] I was t hinking m aybe t he best way
t o do t his in t he long run m ay be t o give t hem single channel part s
fe008 [ s^ cs] : and t hen piece t hem t oget her lat er .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : And I [ disfm arker] I have a script ,
fe008 [ s^ cs] : I can piece t hem t oget her .
fe008 [ s] : I m ean , so it ’s like , I [ disfm arker] I know t hat I can t ake
t hem apart and put t hem t oget her and I ’ll end up wit h t he
represent at ion
fe008 [ s] : which is where t he real power of t hat int erface is .
fe008 [ s^ am ^ ba] : And it m ay be t hat it ’s fast er t o t ranscribe a
channel at a t im e wit h only one , uh , sound file and one , uh , set of
[ disfm arker] of , uh , ut t erances t o check t hrough .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s] : I ’m a lit t le confused .
m e013 [ s] : I t hought t hat [ disfm arker] t hat one of t he reason we
t hought we were so m uch fast er t han [ disfm arker] t han , uh , t he
[ disfm arker] t he ot her t ranscript ion , uh , t hing was t hat [ disfm arker]
t hat we were using t he m ixed [ pause] file .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh , y es . OK .
fe008 [ s^ ng] : But , um , wit h t he m ixed , when you have an overlap ,
y ou only hav e a [ disfm arker] a choice of one st art and end t im e for
t hat ent ire ov erlap ,

fe008 [ s] : which m eans t hat you ’re not t ight ly , uh , t uning t he
indiv idual part s t h of t hat overlap by different speakers .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : So som eone m ay have only said t wo words in t hat ent ire big
chunk of overlap .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And for purposes of [ disfm arker] of , uh , t hings like
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : well , so t hings like t raining t he speech − nonspeech

m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : Th − it ’s necessary t o have it m ore t ight ly t uned t han t hat .
m e013 [ b] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : And w and w and , you know , is a It would be wonderful
if , uh , it ’s possible t hen t o use t hat algorit hm t o m ore t ight ly t ie in all
t he channels aft er t hat
fe008 [ s.%−−] : but , um , you know , I ’ve [ disfm arker] t h t he
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ fh] : So ,
fe008 [ s^ no] : I I don’t know exact ly where t hat ’s going at t his point .
fe008 [ s] : But m I was experim ent ing wit h doing t his by hand
fe008 [ fh] : and
fe008 [ s^ ba] : I really do t hink t hat it ’s wise t hat we ’ve had t hem st art
t he way we hav e
fe008 [ s] : wit h , uh , m y working off t he m ixed signal ,
fe008 [ fh] : um ,
fe008 [ s] : having t he int erface t hat doesn’t require t hem t o do t he t i
uh , t he t im e bins for every single channel at a t uh , t hrough t he
ent ire int eract ion .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : Um , I did discover a couple ot her t hings by doing t his
t hough ,
fe008 [ s] : and one of t hem is t hat ,
fe008 [ fh] : um , um ,
fe008 [ s] : once in a while a backchannel will be overlooked by t he
t ranscriber .
fe008 [ s] : As you m ight expect ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ df.%−−] : because when it ’s
m e013 [ b] : Sure .
fe008 [ s] : a b backchannel could well happen in a very densely
populat ed overlap .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And if we ’re gonna st udy t ypes of overlaps ,
fe008 [ s] : which is what I wanna do ,
fe008 [ s^ e.%−−] : an analysis of t hat ,

fe008 [ s] : t hen t hat really does require list ening [ com m ent ] t o every
single channel all t he way t hrough t he ent ire [ com m ent ] lengt h for all
t he different speakers .
fe008 [ s^ ba^ bd] : Now , for only four speakers , t hat ’s not gonna be
t oo m uch t im e ,
fe008 [ s^ df] : but if it ’s nine speakers , t hen t hat i t hat is m ore t im e .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : So it ’s li you know , kind of wondering [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : And I t hink again it ’s like t his [ disfm arker] it ’s really
v aluable t hat Thilo ’s working on t he speech − nonspeech
segm ent at ion
fe008 [ s^ df] : because m aybe , um , we can close in on t hat wi wit hout
having t o act ually go t o t he t im e t hat it would t ake t o list en t o every
single channel from st art t o finish t hrough every single m eet ing .
m n014 [ s^ bk|s^ ba^ ng] : Yeah , but t hose backchannels will alway s be
a problem I t hink .
m n014 [ s] : Uh especially if t hey ’re really short
m n014 [ s^ e^ rt ] : and t hey ’re not very loud
m n014 [ s] : and so it [ disfm arker] it can [ disfm arker] it [ disfm arker] it
will always happen t hat also t he aut om at ic s det ect ion syst em will m iss
som e of t hem ,
m n014 [ fh] : so .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : Well so t hen [ disfm arker] t hen , m aybe t he answer is t o
, uh , list en especially densely in places of overlap ,
fe008 [ s] : just so t hat t hey ’re [ disfm arker] t hey ’re not being
ov erlooked because of t hat ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : and count on accuracy during t he sparser phases .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ df.%−−] : Cuz t here are large s spaces of t he [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s a good point .
fe008 [ s] : There are large spaces where t here ’s no overlap at all .
fe008 [ s] : Som eone ’s giving a present at ion ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ e] : or what ever .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : That ’s [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a good [ disfm arker] t hat ’s a
good t hought .
fe008 [ fh|s] : And , um , let ’s see , t here was one ot her t hing I was
gonna say .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : I [ disfm arker] I t hink it ’s really int erest ing dat a t o work
wit h ,
fe008 [ s] : I have t o say , it ’s very enjoyable .
fe008 [ s] : I really , not [ disfm arker] not a problem spending t im e wit h
t hese dat a .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Really int erest ing .
fe008 [ s^ df] : And not just because I ’m in t here .

[ disfm arker] if y ou also wanna det erm ine whet her it ’s unvoiced ,
[ v ocalsound] t hen I t hink you want t o [ pause] look [ disfm arker] look at

m e013 [ s.%−−] : But , i i uh [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] I m ean i i
m e013 [ fh] : but , um ,
m e013 [ s] : ot her t han t hat I guess as far as t he one person versus

[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ z] : When [ vocalsound] first I [ disfm arker] [ pause] [ vocalsound]

m n005 [ z] : t he [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ s^ t 1] : Keep forget t ing .
m n005 [ z] : I get t he [ disfm arker] [ pause] t he spect rum ,

[ disfm arker] t he @ @ ,
m n005 [ z] : using t he
m n005 [ z] : inst ant aneous frequency , here .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s^ bu] : Oh , so you scale [ disfm arker] you s you do a
[ disfm arker] a scaling along t hat axis according t o inst ant aneous
[ disfm arker]
m n005 [ z] : I use [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ z] : Yeah .
m n005 [ z] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ bu^ e] : It ’s a kinda norm alizat ion .
m n005 [ z] : Yeah .
m n005 [ z] : Because when [ disfm arker] when [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m n005 [ z] : eh , when i
m n005 [ z] : I [ disfm arker] I use t hese [ disfm arker] t hese frequency ,

m n005 [ z] : eh ,
m n005 [ z] : based in t he [ disfm arker] in t he [ disfm arker]

m n005 [ z] : t hey use a Hanning window .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n005 [ z] : And , t hey said t hat , eh ,

m n005 [ z] : I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I don I
m n005 [ z] : I [ disfm arker] and I don’t know what is t he [ disfm arker]
m n005 [ z] : what is t he dist ance .
m n005 [ z] : And I t ried t o [ disfm arker] t o put different dist ance ,
m n005 [ z] : eh ,

m n005 [ z] : Pfff !
m n005 [ z] : and I [ disfm arker] I not sure what happened .
m e013 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , yeah well I [ disfm arker] I guess I ’m not following
it enough .
m e013 [ s] : I ’ll [ com m ent ] probably gonna haft a look at t he paper ,
m e013 [ s] : but [ disfm arker] which I ’m not gonna have t im e t o do in
t he nex t few day s ,
m e013 [ s^ ba] : but [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] but I ’m [ disfm arker] I ’m
curious about it .
m n005 [ z] : Yeah .
m e013 [ fh] : Um , uh ,
m e013 [ s^ bk] : OK .
fe008 [ s^ t ^ t c] : I I did i it did occur t o m e t hat t his is [ disfm arker] uh ,
t he ret urn t o t he t ranscript ion ,
fe008 [ s^ t ^ t c] : t hat t here ’s one t hird t hing I want ed t o [ disfm arker]
t o ex raise as a t o as an issue
fe008 [ s] : which is , um , how t o handle breat hs .
fe008 [ s] : So , I want ed t o raise t he quest ion of whet her people in
speech recognit ion want t o know where t he breat hs are .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And t he reason I ask t he quest ion is ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : um , aside from t he fact t hat t hey ’re obviously very t im e
− consum ing t o encode ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : uh , t he fact t hat t here was som e [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : I had t he indicat ion from Dan Ellis in t he em ail t hat I sent t o
y ou ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : and y ou know about ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ cs] : t hat in principle we m ight be able t o , um , handle
breat hs by accessi by using cross − t alk from t he ot her t hings ,
fe008 [ %−−] : be able t hat [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ cs] : in principle , m aybe we could get rid of t hem ,
fe008 [ %−−] : so m ay be [ disfm arker]

fe008 [ s.%−−] : And I was [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ no] : I [ disfm arker] I don’t know ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I m ean we had t his an
fe008 [ s] : and I didn’t [ disfm arker] couldn’t get back t o you ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : but t he quest ion of whet her it ’d be possible t o elim inat e
t hem from t he audio signal ,
fe008 [ s^ ba] : which would be t he ideal sit uat ion ,
fe008 [ %−] : cuz [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ nd] : I don’t know [ disfm arker] t hink it ’d be ideal .
m e018 [ s^ ar] : Uh − uh .
m e013 [ s^ df] : We − See , we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re dealing wit h real
speech
m e013 [ s^ df] : and we ’re t rying t o have it be as real as possible
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ df^ e] : and breat hs are part of real speech .
fe008 [ s^ nd.%−−] : Well , except t hat t hese are really t ruly [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s.%−−] : I m ean , t her t here ’s a segm ent in o t he one I did
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : n t he first one t hat I did for [ disfm arker] i for t his ,
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ df] : where t ruly w we ’re hearing you breat hing like
[ disfm arker] as if we ’re [ disfm arker] y ou ’re in our ear ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : y ou know , and it ’s like [ disfm arker] it ’s like
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ %−−] : I y i
fe008 [ s^ na] : I m ean , breat h is nat ural ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : but not
m e013 [ s^ ng] : It is [ disfm arker] but it is if you record it .
m n005 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s^ nd.%−−] : Except t hat we ’re [ disfm arker] we ’re t rying t o m im ic
[ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk] : Oh , I see what you ’re saying .
fe008 [ s] : You ’re saying t hat t he PDA applicat ion would have
[ disfm arker] uh , have t o cope wit h breat h .
m e013 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .
m e011 [ %−] : Well
fe008 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ aap] : An − any applicat ion m ay have t o .
m n014 [ s^ ar] : No .
m e011 [ s^ nd] : The P D A m ight not have t o ,
m n014 [ %−] : No [ disfm arker] i
m e011 [ s^ df] : but m ore people t han just PDA users are int erest ed in
t his corpus .
m n014 [ s^ aa] : Yeah .

fe008 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , t hen t he [ disfm arker] t hen [ disfm arker] I hav e t wo
quest ions .
m e011 [ s] : So [ disfm arker] so m ean you ’re right
m e011 [ s] : we could rem ove it ,
fe008 [ b] : Yeah ?
m e011 [ s^ cs] : but I [ disfm arker] I t hink [ disfm arker] we don’t wanna w
rem ove it from t he corpus , [ pause] in t erm s of delivering it
m e011 [ s^ df] : because t he [ disfm arker] people will want it in t here .
fe008 [ s^ bk|s^ cs] : OK , so m ay be t he quest ion is not at ing it .
m e013 [ fg|%−] : Yeah . If it get s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ qw] : Yeah ?
m e013 [ fg] : Yeah [ disfm arker] i Right .
m e013 [ s] : If [ disfm arker] if it get s in t he way of what som ebody is
doing wit h it t hen y ou m ight wanna have som e m et hod which will allow
y ou t o block it ,
m e013 [ s^ df] : but you [ disfm arker] it ’s real dat a .
m e013 [ s^ cs.%−−] : You don’t wanna b but you don’t [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk|%−] : OK , well [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : If s y ou know , if t here ’s a lit t le bit of noise out t here ,
and som ebody is [ disfm arker] is t alking about som et hing t hey ’re doing
, t hat ’s part of what we accept as part of a real m eet ing ,
m e013 [ %−−] : even [ disfm arker] And
m e013 [ s] : we have t he f uh [ disfm arker] t he uh [ disfm arker] t he
[ disfm arker] t he fan and t he [ disfm arker] in t he project or up t here ,
m e013 [ s] : and , uh , t his is [ disfm arker] it ’s [ disfm arker] t his is act ual
st uff t hat we [ disfm arker] we wanna work wit h .
fe008 [ s^ ba] : Well t his is in very int erest ing
m e013 [ fh] : So .
fe008 [ s^ df] : because i it basically has a i it shows very clearly t he
cont rast bet ween , uh , speech recognit ion research and discourse
research
fe008 [ s] : because in [ disfm arker] in discourse and linguist ic research
, what count s is what ’s com m unit com m unicat ive .
m e018 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : And [ disfm arker] breat h ,
fe008 [ s] : y ou know , everyone breat hes ,
fe008 [ s^ e] : t hey breat he all t he t im e .
fe008 [ s^ bd^ df] : And once in a while breat h is com m unicat ive ,
fe008 [ s^ df] : but r v ery rarely .
fe008 [ fg|s] : OK , so now , I had a discussion wit h Chuck about t he
dat a st ruct ure
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : and t he idea is t hat t he t ranscript s will [ disfm arker] t hat
[ disfm arker] get st ored as a m ast er
fe008 [ s] : t here ’ll be a m ast er t ranscript

fe008 [ s] : which has in it everyt hing t hat ’s needed for bot h of t hese
uses .
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : And t he one t hat ’s used for speech recognit ion will be
processed via script s .
fe008 [ s] : You know , like , Don ’s been writ ing script s
fe008 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and ,
m e013 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : uh , t o process it for t he speech recognit ion side .
fe008 [ s.%−−] : Discourse side will [ vocalsound] have
fe008 [ %−−] : t his [ disfm arker] t his side over he t he [ disfm arker] we we
’ll have a s ch
fe008 [ s^ fa|s] : Sorry , not being v ery fluent here .
fe008 [ fh] : But , um ,
fe008 [ s] : t his [ disfm arker] t he discourse side will have a script which
will st ri st rip away t he t hings which are non − com m unicat ive .
fe008 [ s] : OK . So t hen t he [ disfm arker] t hen [ disfm arker] let ’s
[ disfm arker] let ’s t hink about t he pract icalit ies of how we get t o t hat
m ast er copy wit h reference t o breat hs .
fe008 [ qy ] : So what I would [ disfm arker] r r what I would wonder is
would it be possible t o encode t hose aut om at ically ?
fe008 [ qy ] : Could we get a breat h det ect or ?
m e011 [ s^ bk|s^ bu] : Oh , just t o save t he t ranscribers t im e .
fe008 [ s^ df^ na] : Well , I m ean , y ou just have no idea .
fe008 [ s] : I m ean , if you ’re get t ing a breat h several t im es every
m inut e ,
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s] : and just sim ply t he keyst rokes it t akes t o negot iat e , t o put
t he boundaries in , t o [ disfm arker] t o t ype it in , i it ’s just a huge
am ount of t im e .
m e011 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m n014 [ s^ t 1.%] : Oops .
m n005 [ z] : Yeah .
m e013 [ %−] : Wh − what [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ cs] : And you wanna be sure it ’s used ,
fe008 [ s] : and you wanna be sure it ’s done as efficient ly as possible ,
fe008 [ s] : and if it can be done aut om at ically , t hat would be ideal .
m e013 [ qh] : what if you put it in but didn’t put t he boundaries ?
fe008 [ %−] : Well , but [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ bu] : So you just know it ’s bet ween t hese ot her t hings ,
fe008 [ fg|s] : Well , OK . So now t here ’s [ disfm arker] t here ’s anot her
[ disfm arker] anot her possibilit y
m e013 [ qy^ d^ g^ rt ] : right ?
fe008 [ s^ cs] : which is , um , t he t im e boundaries could m ark off words
[ com m ent ] from nonwords .

fe008 [ s] : And t hat would be ext rem ely t im e − effect ive , if t hat ’s
sufficient .
m e013 [ fg|s] : Yeah I m ean I ’m t hink if it ’s t oo [ disfm arker] if it ’s t oo
hard for us t o annot at e t he breat hs per se , [ vocalsound] we are
gonna be building up m odels for t hese t hings
m e013 [ s] : and t hese t hings are som ewhat self − aligning ,
m e013 [ s] : so if [ disfm arker] so , [ v ocalsound] we [ disfm arker] i i if we
say t here is som e kind of a t hing which we call a " breat h " or a "
breat h − in " or " breat h − out " , [ vocalsound] t he m odels will learn t hat
sort of t hing .
m e013 [ s] : Uh , so [ disfm arker] but you [ disfm arker] but you do want
t hem t o point t hem at som e region where [ disfm arker] where t he
breat hs really are .
fe008 [ s^ bk|s] : OK . But t hat would m aybe include a pause as well ,
m e013 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ %−] : Well , t here ’s a t here ’s [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s] : and t hat wouldn’t be a problem t o have it , uh , pause plus
breat h plus laugh plus sneeze ?
m e013 [ fg|%−] : Yeah , i
m e013 [ s] : You know t here is [ disfm arker] t here ’s t his dynam ic
t ension bet ween [ disfm arker] bet ween m arking absolut ely every t hing ,
as y ou know ,
m e013 [ fh] : and [ disfm arker] and [ disfm arker] and
m e013 [ s] : m arking just a lit t le bit and count ing on t he st at ist ical
m et hods .
m e013 [ s] : Basically t he m ore we can m ark t he bet t er .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : But if t here seem s t o be a lot of effort for a sm all
am ount of reward in som e area ,
m e013 [ s] : and t his m ight be one like t his [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : Alt hough I [ disfm arker] I [ disfm arker] I ’d be int erest ed
t o h get [ disfm arker] get input from Liz and Andreas on t his t o see if
t hey [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ df] : Cuz t hey ’ve − t hey ’ve got lot s of experience wit h t he
breat hs in [ disfm arker] in , uh , uh , t heir t ranscript s .
m e018 [ %−] : I [ disfm arker]
m e011 [ qy ^ bu^ d^ j^ rt ] : They have lot s of experience wit h breat hing ?
m e013 [ %−] : Act ually [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ aa|s] : Well , [ vocalsound] yes t hey do ,
m e013 [ s] : but we [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] we can handle t hat
wit hout t hem here .
m e013 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker] but [ disfm arker] but , uh ,
m e013 [ s.%−] : y ou were gonna say som et hing about [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s^ aa|s.%−−] : Yeah , I [ disfm arker] I t hink , um , one possible
way t hat we could handle it is t hat ,
m e018 [ fh] : um ,

m e018 [ s.%−−] : you know , as t he t ranscribers are going t hrough , and
if t hey get a hunk of speech t hat t hey ’re gonna t ranscribe ,
m e018 [ s] : u t h t hey ’re gonna t ranscribe it because t here ’s words in
t here or what not .
m e018 [ s] : If t here ’s a breat h in t here , t hey could t ranscribe t hat .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
fe008 [ s] : That ’s what t hey ’ve been doing .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ b] : Right .
fe008 [ s] : So , wit hin an overlap segm ent , t hey [ disfm arker] t hey do
t his .
m e018 [ %−] : But [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ fg|s^ cs] : Right . But if t here ’s a big hunk of speech , let ’s say
on Morgan ’s m ike where he ’s not t alking at all , um , don’t
[ disfm arker] don’t worry about t hat .
m n014 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s.%−−] : So what we ’re saying is , t here ’s no guarant ee t hat ,
um [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : So for t he chunks t hat are t ranscribed , everyt hing ’s
t ranscribed .
m e018 [ s] : But out side of t hose boundaries , t here could have been
st uff t hat wasn’t t ranscribed .
m e018 [ s] : So y ou just [ disfm arker] som ebody can’t rely on t hat dat a
and say " t hat ’s perfect ly clean dat a " .
m e018 [ qy ] : Uh [ disfm arker] do you see what I ’m saying ?
fe008 [ s^ aa|s^ na] : Yeah , you ’re say ing it ’s [ disfm arker] unchart ed
t errit ory .
m e018 [ s^ cs] : So I would say don’t t ell t hem t o t ranscribe anyt hing
t hat ’s out side of a grouping of words .
m e013 [ s^ na] : That sounds like a reasonable [ disfm arker] reasonable
com prom ise .
m n014 [ fg|s] : Yeah , and t hat ’s [ disfm arker] t hat [ disfm arker] t hat
quit e co corresponds t o t he way I [ disfm arker] I t ry t o t rain t he speech
− nonspeech det ect or ,
m n014 [ s] : as I really t ry t o [ disfm arker] not t o det ect t hose breat hs
m n014 [ s] : which are not wit hin a speech chunk but wit h [ disfm arker]
which are just in [ disfm arker] in a silence region .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m n014 [ s] : And t hey [ disfm arker] so t hey hopefully won’t be m arked in
[ disfm arker] in t hose channel − specific files .
m e018 [ %−] : Yeah , so [ disfm arker]
m n014 [ fh] : But [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : u I [ disfm arker] I want ed t o com m ent a lit t le m ore just for
clarificat ion about t his business about t he different purposes .
fe008 [ b] : Mm − hm m .
m e013 [ s] : See , in a [ disfm arker] in a way t his is a really key point ,

m e013 [ s.%−−] : t hat for speech recognit ion , uh , research ,
m e013 [ fh] : uh , um ,
m e013 [ s] : e a [ disfm arker] it ’s not just a m inor part .
m e013 [ s] : In fact , t he [ disfm arker] I t hink I would say t he core t hing
t hat we ’re t rying t o do is t o recognize t he act ual , m eaningful
com ponent s in t he m idst of ot her t hings t hat are not m eaningful .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : So it ’s crit ical [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s^ e] : it ’s not just incident al
m e013 [ s] : it ’s crit ical for us t o get t hese ot her com ponent s t hat are
not m eaningful .
m e013 [ s^ df] : Because t hat ’s what we ’re t rying t o pull t he ot her out
of .
m e013 [ s] : That ’s our problem .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : If we had not hing [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ b] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : if we had only linguist ically − relevant t hings
[ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s.%−−] : if [ disfm arker] if we only had changes in t he spect rum
t hat were associat ed wit h words , wit h different spect ral com ponent s ,
m e013 [ s.%−−] : and , uh , we [ disfm arker] we didn’t have noise ,
m e013 [ s] : we didn’t have conv olut ional errors ,
m e013 [ s] : we didn’t have ext raneous , uh , behaviors , and so fort h ,
m e013 [ s] : and [ vocalsound] m oving your head
m e013 [ s] : and all t hese sort s of t hings ,
m e013 [ s^ ba] : t hen , act ually speech recognit ion i i isn’t t hat bad
right now .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean you can
m n005 [ z] : Yeah .
m e013 [ s^ ba] : y ou know it ’s [ disfm arker] [ vocalsound] it ’s
[ disfm arker] t he t echnology ’s com e along pret t y well .
m e013 [ s] : The [ disfm arker] t he [ disfm arker] t he reason we st ill
com plain about it is because is [ disfm arker] when [ disfm arker] when
y ou hav e m ore realist ic condit ions t hen [ disfm arker] t hen t hings fall
apart .
fe008 [ s^ bk|s^ ba] : OK , fair enough .
fe008 [ qw] : I guess , um , I [ disfm arker] uh , what I was wondering is
what [ disfm arker] what [ disfm arker] at what level does t he breat hing
aspect ent er int o t he problem ?
fe008 [ s^ df.%−−] : Because if it were likely t hat a PDA would be able t o
be built which would get rid of t he breat hing , so it wouldn’t even have
t o be processed at t hi at t his com put at ional le
fe008 [ s^ bd] : well , let m e see , it ’d hav e t o be com put at ionally
processed t o get rid of it ,
fe008 [ s.%−−] : but if t here were , uh , like likely on t he front ier , a good
breat h ext ract or
fe008 [ s.%−] : t hen , um , and t hen y ou ’d have t o [ disfm arker]

m e013 [ s^ bd] : But t hat ’s a research quest ion ,
m e013 [ qy ^ d^ f^ g] : you know ?
m e013 [ %−] : And so [ disfm arker]
fe008 [ s^ bk|s^ df] : Yeah , well , see and t hat ’s what I wouldn’t know .
m e013 [ %−] : t hat [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : And we don’t eit her .
m e013 [ s.%−−] : I m ean so [ disfm arker] so t he t hing is it ’s [ disfm arker]
it [ disfm arker]
m e013 [ s] : right now it ’s just raw d it ’s just dat a t hat we ’re collect ing
,
m e013 [ s] : and so [ v ocalsound] we don’t wanna presuppose t hat
people will be able t o get rid of part icular degradat ions
m e013 [ s^ df] : because t hat ’s act ually t he research t hat we ’re t rying
t o feed .
fe008 [ b] : OK .
m e013 [ s] : So , you know , an and m aybe [ disfm arker] m aybe in five
y ears it ’ll work really well ,
m e013 [ s] : and [ disfm arker] and it ’ll only m ess − up t en percent of t he
t im e ,
m e013 [ s] : but t hen we would st ill want t o account for t hat t en
percent ,
fe008 [ s] : I guess t here ’s anot her aspect
m e013 [ fh] : so .
fe008 [ s^ df] : which is t hat as we ’ve im proved our m icrophone
t echnique , we hav e a lot less breat h in t he [ disfm arker] in t he m ore
recent , uh , recordings ,
fe008 [ s] : so it ’s [ disfm arker] in a way it ’s an art ifact t hat t here ’s so
m uch on t he [ disfm arker] on t he earlier ones .
m e013 [ b] : Uh − huh .
m e013 [ s^ bk] : I see .
m e018 [ %−−] : One of t he [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s.%−−] : um , just t o add t o t his [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : one of t he ways t hat we will be able t o get rid of breat h is
by having m odels for t hem .
m e018 [ s] : I m ean , t hat ’s what a lot of people do nowadays .
m e011 [ b] : Right .
m e013 [ b] : Right .
m e018 [ s] : And so in order t o build t he m odel you need t o have som e
am ount of it m arked ,
m n005 [ z] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ df] : so t hat you know where t he boundaries are .
m n005 [ z] : Hm m .
m e013 [ b] : Yeah .
m e018 [ fh] : So [ disfm arker]
m e018 [ s] : I m ean , I don’t t hink we need t o worry a lot about breat hs
t hat are happening out side of a , you know , conversat ion .

m e018 [ s^ cs] : We don’t have t o go and search for t hem t o
[ disfm arker] t o m ark t hem at all ,
m e018 [ s^ cs] : but , I m ean , if t hey ’re t here while t hey ’re
t ranscribing som e hunk of words , I ’d say put t hem in if possible .
fe008 [ s^ bk|s] : OK , and it ’s also t he fact t hat t hey differ a lot from
one channel t o t he ot her
fe008 [ s^ df] : because of t he way t he m icrophone ’s adjust ed .
m n005 [ z] : Yeah .
m e018 [ s^ aa] : Mm − hm m .
fe008 [ s^ bk] : OK .
m e013 [ qy ^ rt ^ t ^ t c] : Should we do t he digit s ?
m e011 [ s^ aa] : Yep .
m e011 [ z] : OK .
m n005 [ z] : OK .
m e001 [ z] : Mm m . Alright .
